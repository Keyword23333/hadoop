2310000 james was one of the fastest on track at the end of the race
2310001 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2310002 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2310003 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2310004 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2310005 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2310006 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false
2310007 used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it
2310008 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2310009 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2310010 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2310011 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2310012 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2310013 there was no single fair way to interpret that without disenfranchising somebody
2310014 so i asked that the count be done both ways in both cases the protest didnt succeed
2310015 we will want to go through every single invalidated protest we want to know why and who was considered invalid
2310016 we hope well have a community that will come together because we certainly are divided
2310017 take it slowly and do projects piecemeal if we need to were not going to spend all this money tomorrow anyway
2310018 i will not let this disease get the best of me
2310019 more aggressive and more difficult to contain and bigger and badder every year
2310020 there are three things that are driving it climate development fuel loads and theyre all unequivocally going in the wrong direction
2310021 i dont see how anybody could think were anywhere close to being at the worst of this
2310022 when the firefighters show up there are dollars along with them
2310023 if you talk to townspeople theyll say it was a good summer they had a fire it saved their summer
2310024 you get the media pressure the homeowners calling elected officials calling
2310025 political people have to get in and say were doing everything we can
2310026 the county administrator was reading the proclamation and somebody came in and whispered to me the governor is in the parking lot
2310027 while we were having our meeting he was looking at the big cloud over the hill and talking to his office
2310028 i remember the biggest improvement was when they got tables with chairs so you could sit down to eat
2310029 the toilets were a slit trench in the ground you slept on the ground there were no tents
2310030 i got called 28 times last year i wasnt able to keep up
2310031 i dont know of many businesses that would go out and get something pay for it just to stand by when they can readily get it for the times they need it and then let it go
2310032 if i wasnt to have the firetruck i wouldnt be able to afford to farm
2310033 after having never spoken to dr c about symlin before i came into his office for a regular check up said i wanted to try symlin and 15 minutes later the nurse was hooking me up with a sample pen
2310034 dont try to make everyone go for a divorce just because you are
2310035 it wouldnt surprise me if he had tried to help others thats what he was like
2310036 i always worried about him when he went climbing but i never stopped him doing his dream he was always happy go lucky very laid back and had a very kind nature but no matter what he would never have stopped his climbing
2310037 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope
2310038 the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a lot of metres he had no chance
2310039 they saw their friend falling from the top to the bottom they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late
2310040 i was a pretty fat kid didnt do much other than eat and play computer games
2310041 climbing took over when i was 16 after a trip to the dolomites these last years ive lost my belly and took climbing seriously finding it a vent from life and somewhere to push myself competitively ive learnt a lot about myself some of it good some of it bad climbing is my demon but its also my cure
2310042 the resident homoeopath katie jermine quizzed me about my diet stress levels and lifestyle she then strapped on a wristband and plugged me into an electronic device called the quantum qxci which scanned my system for vitamins minerals food intolerances toxicity organ function hormone balance parasites digestive disorders and stress levels
2310043 the most advanced medical assessment and therapy device in the world today
2310044 technology attracts clients and charges are higher for practitioners who use state of the art assessment and therapy systems
2310045 in the evening standard of august 6 we stated that the duke of edinburgh had been diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the prostate we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2310046 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2310047 this complaint reveals the clear advantages of coming to the pcc with complaints of privacy intrusion
2310048 the process has been quick the final settlement was negotiated less than 36 hours after the original complaint was made
2310049 i am trying to strengthen the link between mps and their constituents
2310050 the research on the use of such technology shows that when it is well designed it can actually be better than teaching even by the best teachers
2310051 robots cant teach the only effective teaching is by breathing living teachers who can look a pupil in the eye and respond to them
2310052 use phonic knowledge to write simple words and make phonetically plausible attempts at more complex words
2310053 of course children might take to it but that does not necessarily mean its good for them three year olds should not be doing phonics they should do whats normal in nurseries singing rhyming and playing
2310054 we dont want a monoculture of heather or of grouse many people have a potential interest in the uplands farmers foresters keepers wildlife enthusiasts tourists we are working towards a sustainable way of managing geltsdale to meet those different needs
2310055 we recognise the biodiversity achievements of many shooting moors and like it or not their style of intensive grouse moor management is not going to go away
2310056 but the moorland associations own figure of shooting contributing 12 5m a year to the rural economy is hardly staggering compared to the huge economic potential of tourism
2310057 well weve recorded 96 species breeding on geltsdale this year
2310058 that slight banking on the moor edge above was the tramway from the mine where stephensons rocket worked in its retirement
2310059 this is robust science and it is important that this sort of monitoring continues
2310060 the question was posed by david miliband when he was environment secretary what are the uplands for our moor is going to be part of the answer
2310061 but were all going to be learning a little about diving in the next few weeks
2310062 we all think he can win he has as good a chance as anybody there will be no one out there that hes competing against that he hasnt beaten already he is excited but determined to do the best he can for himself his family and his country
2310063 thats a good sign because he usually calls when hes homesick i dont want to be phoning him too much because he might start missing home which affects his training
2310064 ive been in touch with them and theyre loving it the british diving team is a close group so well all be cheering for them
2310065 people are coming and giving it a go thats what sport and the olympics is about people being inspired to take part
2310066 we are delighted with this outcome this is a judgment that allows turf tv to continue in business and maintains healthy competition in the supply of picture and data services
2310067 we were dealing with an entrenched monopoly supported by ladbrokes and hills
2310068 the tote are irredeamable sic bastards and everyone their sic should have been shot at birth members of the abb i dont think so
2310069 i cant believe im letting people throw balls at me its hilarious
2310070 the public have every right to be concerned about the increased growth of this sort of violence it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2310071 this was a deliberate attack requiring a long chase with revenge in mind this was really arrogant group violence and the result is totally unacceptable it was an attack carried out without any regard to the standards and rules that we live by and no thought for the victim his friends and his family
2310072 i have little doubt that you are a willful individual you are prone to anger you have shown a tendency to use violence when it suits you
2310073 immaturity coupled with a misguided sense of principality and loyalty
2310074 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone on before and no mercy was shown
2310075 martin was a charming loving boy who has left us with cherished memories that will remain with us forever
2310076 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin it was extremely sad to be burying martin at the tender age of 14
2310077 the murder of martin highlights the potentially fatal consequences that may result from carrying knives and other weapons
2310078 this case graphically illustrates the growing scourge of urban posturing which includes the aimless meandering among groups of people who are prepared to if not actively seeking confrontation exploit any pretext in order to engage in aggressive violent behaviour
2310079 this is the first complete mitochondrial genome sequence from an extinct hominid
2310080 exact relationship with modern humans remains a topic of debate
2310081 let us calculate how long ago was the most recent common ancestor of humans and neanderthals
2310082 one sensible explanation for this could be a very small effective population size
2310083 what we can say is that there was a lot of change in a very short time within modern humans
2310084 further work will be necessary to say what the consequences of these changes were
2310085 been waiting a long time for this sequence to come out
2310086 the most striking thing about the paper is that it shows that the authors are able to get an extremely reliable dna sequence out of a 38 000 year old neanderthal fossil especially when they do a large amount of dna sequencing
2310087 becomes obvious that the sequence the authors are obtaining is correct
2310088 its role as a driver of innovation in australia is not as effective as it could be
2310089 the economic impact of crcs has been primarily through end user application of research rather than direct commercialisation
2310090 a greater emphasis should be placed on translating research outputs into not just economic but also social and environmental benefits
2310091 it must be a real problem that the end users desperately need solved
2310092 at the moment theres an awful lot of driving from the crcs themselves
2310093 it should really be about tax payers dollars causing major spill overs to the community
2310094 the proposal is not ideologically driven in that its got to be about public good or about commercialisation
2310095 there are many different ways you can get bang for your buck
2310096 for a program that is meant to be driven by end users and by national needs its a surprise that the crc program has not more explicitly and systematically involved social science arts and humanities
2310097 its about getting the people with the right training with the right team work the right interdisciplinary configurations
2310098 implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes may be underestimated
2310099 as the tropics warm we are seeing an increased frequency in the heaviest rainfall
2310100 flash flooding can cause damage to settlements and societies it can contaminate ground water drinking supplies with potential health effects
2310101 the spread of disease can be impacted by heavy rainfall
2310102 very intense rainfall can destroy crops there are also possibilities of enhanced erosion degradation of soil
2310103 we can think of the elite athlete as what id call a complex phenotype
2310104 its like a complex disease like diabetes there are going to be a large number of different genes involved any one single test is unlikely to be highly predictive
2310105 the feeling i have is that it wont be that easy
2310106 the human genetics society thinks there are insufficient data to use these tests for determining what sport kids should do
2310107 my prediction is that genetic information might be worth one per cent of your decision on talent selection
2310108 i dont think well ever be in a position of saying if youve got a certain gene it rules you out of a sport
2310109 its attitude psychology performance under pressure its access to good coaching over time and access to facilities nutrition and family support is terribly important
2310110 at the end of the day were looking for people who can play football
2310111 the financial sector crisis is now spilling into the real economy its not out of the woods
2310112 liang is a metropolis while command in chief a man of tremendous virtue for he receives his mandate from the sovereign of china and procures his pension from the people of china but when he recommended a candidate he sought among foreign barbarians does it mean that there were no qualified chinese and the foreigner alone was good for employment i am confused by the judgment
2310113 bereits heute hat sich die schere zwischen den f rderkosten heimischer steinkohle und den preisen f r importkohle deutlich verkleinert wenn der weltmarktpreis weiter steigt ist die wettbewerbsf higkeit deutscher steinkohle eine konkrete perspektive
2310114 hier wird man in richtung eines politischen tauschgesch fts denken l ngere laufzeiten von deutschen zechen gegen l ngere laufzeiten von deutschen atomkraftwerken
2310115 sie will die co2 emissionen um 40 prozent senken das geht aber nur wenn wir die atomkraftwerke l nger laufen lassen von wind und sonne kann ein industrieland nicht leben
2310116 since there are some arminians who are more godly than some calvinists and some calvinists who are more godly than some arminians what is the correlation between true knowledge of god and godliness
2310117 mr wesley i think is wrong in some things yet i believe mr wesley and others with whom we do not agree in all things will shine bright in glory
2310118 even by 2012 well still have an advantage to bts fibre to the cabinet fttc well certainly be able to offer up to 200mbit s broadband download speeds if we so chose
2310119 contrary to recent reports labor day is still a holiday at tyson foods the issue concerns only the plant at shelbyville
2310120 we in the labor movement have always understood that unions are only strong when we work to protect the dignity of all faiths and that includes muslims
2310121 its too early to say we could use sputnik as a weapon against big viruses or to modify them
2310122 but phages are used to modify bacteria so why not
2310123 so naturalists observe a flea hath smaller fleas that on him prey and these have smaller fleas to bite em and so proceed ad infinitum
2310124 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step only he who keeps his eyes fixed on the far horizon will find the right road
2310125 mark is something that we did not have last year a pure centre
2310126 the availability of contractors and i would say the lack of competition for people to bid on your project have had a more significant impact on cost increases than even we would have anticipated
2310127 every day longer it takes us to get on stream thats another day of construction costs and operating costs
2310128 you have all of this activity going on in the oil sands and not all of it can come in on time and on budget
2310129 given that canadian natural was so close to being done and here we have a further announcement of cost increases that is somewhat disappointing but in the big picture it really doesnt make that much of a difference
2310130 certainly for a long time there has been this thing oh it doesnt happen bicyclists dont have this problem
2310131 it looks different and when you first get on the bike you have to balance differently but its not a difficult adjustment
2310132 noseless saddles take the pressure off the groin area theyre much more comfortable to use

2310139 pain during intercourse can affect your relations with your partner your image as a woman your mood all sorts of things
2310140 it just isnt that simple for a lot of women
2310141 its not like popping a pill or putting on a cream
2310142 we just wish we had a better tool for screening
2310143 the problem with this type of information is that it is not rigorously peer reviewed and the final results may differ from the preliminary findings
2310144 some people will say of course i knew that drug companies spin their study results
2310145 but no one to my knowledge has really documented this in a scientific way
2310146 i dont think its a good idea to move during pregnancy it may be more stressful than helpful
2310147 however each enterprise will view iphone through its own lens which will be heavily tinted by the organisations security and management needs
2310148 enterprises should approach expanded use of the iphone slowly and with close examination
2310149 theyve real madrid sic stoked the fires and let everything else ronaldo saga sic run its course they knew the english press would piss itself silly trying to fill column inches on the story and when the shit lords of uk went ahead and did exactly that the fans minds were poisoned and now they just dont care any more its a very sad state of affairs i hope ronaldo can win the fans back although a lot of it will depend on what happens the next time the fake madrid come knocking the fans are just as if not more fickle than the players
2310150 we do not know whether this mechanism is active or what exactly it does
2310151 it might vaporise applications it might simply prevent them from using the gps it might do nothing except upset the privacy advocates who dont like their iphone calling home
2310152 for all we know it could trigger world war three or it could cause some computer somewhere to spit out recipes for buttermilk pancakes

2310162 its average athletes who are the most likely to curtail their sleep to train
2310163 theyre getting up at 4 a m to run for an hour so they can get to work by 7 a m
2310164 in terms of overall training benefit its better to get your sleep because the platform of good training is recovery
2310165 i know it sounds ridiculous to get 10 hours of sleep a night
2310166 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia
2310167 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method

2310176 this event was so important because it triggered a change in the plate motions and boundaries in the pacific and led to the current set of plate motions which were still experiencing
2310177 what we saw in that boundary between northern new south wales and southern queensland where the volcanoes were around 25 million years old the age migration pattern slowed down for a couple of million year period between 26 and 23 million years ago
2310178 it slowed down by almost a third this suggests lower plate motion
2310179 id certainly like to see sir steve redgrave perform this
2310180 these paddles by the way are very very heavy we appreciate the precision and energy of these movements
2310181 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a loss is something i and my colleagues regret very much
2310182 we are deeply disappointed to be announcing these results and apologise for the pain this has caused our shareholders
2310183 were in the middle of a financial markets crisis the industry is in a tight place and as a major participant in the industry we are in a tight place we are not alone in having taken write downs
2310184 i wont do this job forever but right now you will find me extremely galvanised to do the task at hand
2310185 we reiterate our view that rbs has absolutely no need to sell rbs insurance
2310186 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
2310187 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
2310188 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
2310189 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
2310190 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
2310191 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
2310192 this has yet to be verified inside thermal and evolved gas analyzer instruments
2310193 this does not preclude life on mars in fact it is a potential energy source
2310194 how this perchlorate affects habitability on mars is certainly a complex question that we dont have a final answer on
2310195 it really doesnt limit us in our search for habitability in this icy soil and if we were lucky enough to see some organic signatures we wouldnt be surprised

2310209 we barged into cinema like cavemen into the versailles of louis xiv

2310222 in the last maybe 10 15 years we had reached pretty much a bottleneck in resolution and efficiency

2310240 last november we said that we would explore the possible sale of some or all of the u s coal assets of rio tinto energy america
2310241 we are in active discussions with a number of prospective buyers who have expressed strong interest in those coal assets
2310242 while the company has fully provided for these assessments in the financial statements and paid all of the tax related to the assessments based on the advice of its professional tax advisers the company believes that the tax authorities have misapplied the legislation
2310243 as a result the company plans to vigorously contest the states position in court
2310244 we now have in place the strongest team we have ever had both in toronto and in romania
2310245 all of our energy is focused on getting the rosia montana project back on track laying the groundwork now so that when the project review begins again we can move forward quickly
2310246 if you can get drugs you can now lead a relatively normal life
2310247 i ran out of fingers and toes to count the inequalities
2310248 the scale up of antiretroviral therapy is the most ambitious public health undertaking of our lifetimes
2310249 weve already accomplished the impossible in the last 10 years
2310250 we can succeed but our future is precarious the technical challenges are formidable and the political ones are brutal
2310251 she is fit with abs that would make a photoshop editor cry at their perfection
2310252 it makes me feel even more inadequate to know that torres is a 41 year old mother of a two year old where id like to know are her stretch marks and postpregnancy pooch
2310253 ms torres has got a great abdominal its a good body a great body
2310254 it took a lot of work i dont want people getting false ideals
2310255 i have some of the fittest elderly women i have seen in my life
2310256 the no 1 thing i get more than anything is people say they want to look toned
2310257 a lot of people think with a toned body like madonnas it looks sexy and it looks healthy too
2310258 the image of that body translates into beliefs about a persons character so if you have the willpower to work out six days a week then you must be an incredibly strong character
2310259 i think the ripped female figure is a little more on the extreme
2310260 for some people it would take an obscene amount of work to get them near to that shape

2310278 great post jeremiah sounds like all these companies need to try nattergalen wooha
2310279 the greatest surprise of all even for me after eight years spent working as a film critic has been the sustained level of intensely sadistic brutality throughout the film
2310280 the dark knight is a superhero movie and the violence it contains exists within that context
2310281 watching screen violence had changed the frontal lobe brain function of normal adolescents to be more like that of the children with disruptive brain disorders
2310282 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was
2310283 he was an absolutely logical person to be brought in
2310284 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik
2310285 three musicians who had recently been planning something with him told me he didnt tell them either
2310286 a close friend of his said he was a great eccentric sure he was also a beautiful soul i will miss him very much

2310293 he had a soul that is often missing in the business which has taken on much more of a corporate tone
2310294 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2310295 we got a dead person a 250 a week raise i knew i was in the right business
2310296 you take care of everything and get them ready for the day
2310297 how do you take an actor or comedian or a writer and point them in the right direction and go through all that garbage unless you love it and love them and think theyre talented and worth it
2310298 i put about 20 films in development at lorimar and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2310299 he wasnt the greatest admirer of americans and it didnt go down too easily that one of them should be playing the starring role
2310300 a lot of the reality of digging tunnels was left out too
2310301 chronicling his battles with theater producers alcoholism and a 60 a day cigarette habit
2310302 i dont know that incentives alone are going to do it
2310303 paper shopping bags while more recyclable use a whole lot more energy to make
2310304 thats not to say that paper bags are worse but theres an impact
2310305 i understand the reasoning we should strive to use less of them but there are other methods
2310306 if a store wants to give bags with purchases or give credit for bringing in reusable bags thats great but imposing a fee because they use bags thats another thing
2310307 the whole experience was inspiring and i look forward to sharing it with flashforward attendees what was clear from the conversations i had with this group is that their work is not only driven by passion but the quality of the work is also shaped by it
2310308 passion isnt something you can teach others but it certainly is infectious
2310309 to create work without passion is a season in hell
2310310 there is content everywhere but to find it you have to open up your third eye and see things as if youre seeing them for the very first time

2310318 does a prius make a guy hot or not would you date a guy who drives a prius or a hot sports car

2310323 i do she has had way too much publicity absolutely people should just let her rest
2310324 im always performing it is never ending ive done at least 10 days a month for the past 10 years
2310325 simply that we need it in order to survive the person you are with is giving you the air you breathe in other words we need each other 100 percent
2310326 we have what we call the ae soundboard a panel of college students who are either musicians or real aficionados of the college music scene
2310327 we talk to them throughout the year to keep in touch about emerging trends in music and what theyre passionate about we used them as a driving source we also have some partners out of los angeles called hum who also made great suggestions its a good example of using a group of customers and using them as a voice
2310328 we were contacted by a representative of the festival and asked to play of course we said yes its going to be a great time and we are really happy to be a part of the event
2310329 i guess we just sound like a pop rock band but come check us out and you can decide for yourself
2310330 we havent announced year two but its certainly our hope that this will be an annual event
2310331 im not going to teach your boyfriend how to dance with you
2310332 would there be any way youve collected those swabs to tell whether any cellular material that you picked up was under the fingernail rather than on the finger
2310333 we swab under the fingernail and most of the time you cant see if youve collected anything

2310335 a detective walked by a detective you knew and you looked at him and said im not the one that raped and beat my wife
2310336 we are one of the most hated bands by other bands
2310337 we refused to go out with poison or winger or warrant or any of those bands
2310338 i think thats cool because we are one of the only bands out there from our era name another one that has all the members intact and is out there doing successful business right now
2310339 its a feather in our cap that were still together
2310340 we figured out how to do it in a comfortable way
2310341 when youve been with the same guys for 22 years you can get on each others nerves part of being a team is knowing when to back off
2310342 recording another album is a priority for me i say to brets face thats what we need to do but you cant make people do what they dont want to do i would go in the studio tomorrow
2310343 it was one of the worst things ive ever been through
2310344 six weeks of hell if someone wants to take a potshot at me theyll still use it it was a mistaken identity thing they went after me and even after they realized it wasnt me they were going after me anyway
2310345 its sort of like pop rock country music and well be doing it acoustically
2310346 while shes working on a record we put together this acoustic thing just to have some fun on the road
2310347 americas turned into the town in footloose music should move you make you dance and have fun the funny thing is footloose was a crappy movie
2310348 we are transforming it hopefully into a really fun and celebratory music venue
2310349 we were just those two neighborhood kids who liked the same kind of music
2310350 years later dan was going to record a demo with the band he was in i was going to be there as well but those guys never showed up so we ended up recording our first demo
2310351 at first we had to tour in my minivan playing little music halls to nobody literally nobody the first couple shows we played to like 10 people then we got to seattle and 150 people came out to see us that was huge that was a high point
2310352 we were totally confused but totally giddy that so many people showed up it made us want to keep going even during the summer in a van without air conditioning
2310353 by the time we made it home wed saved 500 and could afford bills for a month or two
2310354 danger mouse was a major part of the record his influence is all over the place sometimes its really subtle sometimes its more extreme
2310355 and he only wanted to work on the record if we wanted a new musical direction
2310356 last night we got to hang out with welsh soul singer duffy and i told her i wanted to redesign her mind
2310357 i always have a concept in mind but i usually never work within that concept or accomplish what im trying to do more often than not i just give up and write regular pop songs thats kind of what i think deerhunter is i think we have a hard time being anything too cerebral or too thought out
2310358 man is not born to solve the problems of the universe but to find out what he has to do
2310359 if i could write a movie i would like it to be a small independant movie with few characters in a insecure setting just focusing on characters and their trials and tribulations
2310360 that increase is only because of the cost of asphalt
2310361 i wasnt consulted and i didnt know what it would be
2310362 it just looks strange but i dont know what it means
2310363 creo que es rid culo que john mccain quiera hundir a obama con el argumento de que es popular si mccain se mete con el mundo de las celebridades entonces vamos a responder
2310364 customers that might have been looking to buy a new boat a year ago are now looking to do up their current model
2310365 were in fact doing a very good business for people who want a new mast or rigging rather than buying a new boat altogether
2310366 were probably 20 down on the corporate hospitality side of things but thats been made up by sailing enthusiasts booking the boats as individuals
2310367 you would expect that these regattas would be hit hard but because there are so many sailors within the companies there are still plenty of entries for this year
2310368 you get everything from people who go to the formal balls and drinks parties right through to people who are sleeping on their boats and going for a few drinks in the beer tents at the end of the week
2310369 were seeing a trend in sailing towards chartering rather than owning boats
2310370 if you own a boat you have to pay to maintain it and keep it berthed
2310371 the higher end does not seem to be feeling the pinch in fact they seem pretty immune from the credit crunch
2310372 its just foolish to spend money at the top instead of the bottom where we need bodies
2310373 many of the ones we were worried about with behavioral issues have turned the corner and are placeable maybe in need of a special home but definitely placeable
2310374 but its about giving them a comfortable happy place to live that theyve never had
2310375 inexperienced and ambitious and a threat to the cause of injured people
2310376 i will conduct myself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity independence and impartiality of the judiciary and participate in thoughtful discourse in judicial forums and with the media
2310377 ive been critical of judge hunts record shes made a lot of mistakes
2310378 to the extent people want to spend their money talking about her mistakes and its factual thats great and these ads are factual
2310379 oh sams quite good at sketching she can do the storyboards for the presentation tomorrow
2310380 miss universo 2008 la controversia surgi a ra z de unas fotos donde se aprecia a la reina de belleza semidesnuda pero dichas fotos son de car cter publicitario por lo que podr conservar la corona las fotograf as de tipo art stico que haya podido hacer como son las que han publicado no tienen ning n inconveniente desde que no se trate de fotograf as pornogr ficas
2310381 el reglamento de miss universo en ning n momento proh be o limita la toma de fotograf as de car cter publicitario y art stico a las candidatas que participan en dicho concurso
2310382 fueron tomadas para fines publicitarios de diferentes productos y por tal raz n son fotos eminentemente art sticas y no contienen ning n mensaje obsceno
2310383 su intenci n es netamente publicitaria deseamos dejar en claro que los requerimientos y limitaciones b sicas que establece el concurso de miss universo a las candidatas son cinco ciudadan a residencia edad ser soltera y no ser reina o virreina de cualquier otro concurso de renombre internacional
2310384 no haber sido modelo de ropa interior ni haber posado para fotograf as o videos desnuda o en ropa ntima a partir de la fecha en que la futura candidata cumpli los quince 15 a os de edad
2310385 fue un rumor que creci m s de la cuenta en venezuela nos confirmaron que la organizaci n de miss universo ya conoc a las fotos de dayanna por eso creemos que no va a pasar nada
2310386 its a win win for everyone owners get a fair market value for their property and community residents get to continue living in their homes
2310387 they would have had to move out and move their homes probably to the dump
2310388 the majority still have mortgages on their homes they would have lost all their investments and still have had to find a place to live
2310389 its been a real joy to participate in this kind of experience
2310390 i think its something that people in other parks might want to consider it does take a lot of work
2310391 the complaints we have gotten today are not from the people who are going to potentially build condominiums downtown
2310392 this is us doing our very best to listen to you before taking the next step
2310393 i believe things can be done better than have been done
2310394 dan has moved away from i believe being a real fiscal conservative and yet hes i believe very very far to the right on social issues
2310395 as i have said with cement producers and aluminium producers and so on you have got to be able to have a safety valve which enables them to increase their emissions above the permitted levels up to some ceiling where they are putting cutting edge technology into lower emission technology
2310396 an appropriate way to deal with those industries is to enable them to increase their emissions beyond the cap where they are investing in new technology and research and development which is going to reduce emissions in the long term
2310397 whilst we support a cap and trade system we do believe that there needs to be a safety valve of this nature in the legislation
2310398 at least its not progressive youll probably outlive most of the population
2310399 i know this is a very wrong thing to think
2310400 themin point of elfin spheres by way of nano crust pores all self important madden beside subrent the well founded elementary unit all wrong excepting foster the sinful against getting inwardly
2310401 getting the magnetocapsules into the rude justice tract requires graphology orb know how generally speaking mandatory for all that dabbling video meet
2310402 we credit that our magnetocapsules transmit mould reticulation speciality trope of comparison and immunosuppressive drugs problems as regards the former times howbeit subliminal self comes in transit to hold based therapies as representing type species 1 diabetes
2310403 rudy is a family pet he doesnt go anywhere but hes part of the family
2310404 at this time with the economy i feel like i need to shop around a little bit
2310405 looking at the paper and looking around makes sense because everything adds up a lot
2310406 i would put it on par for christmas for us
2310407 we see a higher volume of customer traffic typically around this time of year and a lot more fresh faces both of them are huge seasons for us
2310408 sales were up 3 but analysts were expecting more and theyre saying it indicates those stimulus checks have already been spent
2310409 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks
2310410 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at the time
2310411 we will do as much as we can to pass on as much of the interest rate cut as we can
2310412 our position is we want to reduce interest rates to customers as quickly as possible as our funding costs allow
2310413 if they do not receive the full benefit of what the reserve bank has intended then in a way thats subverting what the reserve bank is trying to do through its monetary policy
2310414 we have seen in the us what happens if you dont have a solid banking industry
2310415 i was elected in 1991 at the height and end of wa inc and i remember thinking after the brian burke happenings why didnt they learn a lesson this is even worse than wa inc
2310416 with the growth of china and india to follow we have an opportunity to take the state economy to economic maturity
2310417 what a waste of all of that effort because alan carpenter panicked
2310418 there are two choices ultimately if we dont get water into the system
2310419 one is that the lakes would dry out over time and if that should happen we will get the release of acid sulphate soils and that will cause significant problems the other is that we open up the barrages at the bottom end of the system so we bring salt water into the lakes
2310420 it has come as absolute news to me i obviously knew nothing about it whatsoever
2310421 as an independent statutory authority the accc sets its own enforcement priorities and can direct those resources to indigenous art if appropriate
2310422 recognises that a vibrant and sustainable indigenous art sector is critical for artists and their communities
2310423 arts minister peter garrett seems driven by cost cutting imperatives not the needs of some of australias most talented but vulnerable artists
2310424 orders of the court arent like referees telling players to stay on side
2310425 court orders are serious matters and people who are responsible comply with them
2310426 we havent heard directly from sonny and until such time hes still welcome at our club
2310427 i want to play for the all blacks one day
2310428 im no coward you know i stood up for myself and i stood up for player rights
2310429 it is a very significant reform and has the potential to bring tafe and other non tertiary education into the limelight
2310430 the concern would be that victoria supports it and that nsw is the blocker if coag waits for nsw a good reform will come unstuck
2310431 there have been many steps in the right direction in the education portfolio
2310432 her focus on literacy and on teacher quality has been good
2310433 well it had to happen at some stage its another war criminal out of the way
2310434 8160 as i recall off the top of my head
2310435 the idea is to give the jury a very very clear picture of what happened how the mass grave was constructed how the bodies were disposed of
2310436 its imperative that each site is recorded in meticulous detail if you do a sloppy job the defence could rip your work to pieces
2310437 we found clear evidence of mass killings there were clearly individuals not in uniform that were blindfolded their hands tied and buried
2310438 identifying the mortal remains is labour intensive and requires an integrated approach in which dna is used to guide forensic anthropologists in re associating disarticulated body parts
2310439 more worryingly for the liberals is that internal labor party polling during the last election showed that costello was perceived as out of touch and arrogant by the majority of the electorate further costello was seen as one of the driving forces behind work choices
2310440 as for his role as treasurer i think that history will show that he ignored 20 rba warnings on inflation that australians suffered from 10 straight interest rate rises under his watch and that government spending was out of control
2310441 peter costello is part of the problem he cant be part of the solution his legacy is inflation at 16 year highs and work choices thats peter costellos legacy
2310442 ill only buy the book if its got a chapter in it from peter costello that talks about how he made inflation hit 16 year highs if hes got that chapter in there and if he fesses up to the fact that 10 interest rate rises in a row is slowing the economy ill definitely buy the book
2310443 learn how to fake unbelievable fantasy images like this giant warrior lizard using some clever photoshop trickery

2310445 they are able to amass a huge amount of money and using that money to go out and buy land to do their marijuana cultivation
2310446 this year were probably going to surpass 2007 easily just given the way were starting
2310447 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2310448 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture
2310449 theres no way of them knowing who the buyer is
2310450 huge numbers of south ossetia residents are leaving for russian territory
2310451 in principle those who want to leave leave and those who dont stay and pray that nothing terrible happens to them
2310452 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2310453 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
2310454 we see panic rising among the population and the number of refugees trying to save their own lives and the lives of their children and families growing
2310455 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2310456 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2310457 i understand that the russian federation is a permanent member it is very hard to counter or oppose a permanent member in the security council but what i offer you is to have very solid statement to get to the government of the russian federation and as well the opposing parties that this kind of action should stop
2310458 the bombardment of the sovereign territory of georgia should stop and we call for an immediate ceasefire
2310459 pull back from the brink of a full fledged war
2310460 not allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2310461 i think the georgian leadership has not done the right thing here by not alerting anyone ahead of time by not highlighting any rise in tensions i think in any case that there is no alternative to a peaceful resolution of this issue
2310462 armenia is in the region where the conflict is at this moment and there is no doubt it worries us we really hope that a solution will be found very quickly because at this moment it is true that no solution has been found in the area of security but i think the problem must unequivocally be resolved by peaceful means
2310463 azerbaijan supports georgias territorial integrity and the south ossetia conflict should be solved only within this framework at the same time georgia has every right to restore its territorial integrity provided by the norms and principles of international law including the un charter and therefore all the steps taken by georgia in this direction are in accordance with international law
2310464 these provocations are aimed to destroy georgias strategic plans to become a full fledged member of the north atlantic alliance in a few years
2310465 there are four things i want to talk about today

2310480 we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2310481 weve been encouraging everyone involved and every international party to engage in talks for years months days hours
2310482 we find ourselves in a situation similar to where the czechs were in 1968 to where the hungarians found themselves in 1956
2310483 the conflict might be short and hot but my sense is that neither party wants a prolonged conflict
2310484 its always been returned to us within a day or two in the same condition as it went out
2310485 last friday we received the constitution back at the archives it was no longer encased in its state of the art ten million dollar hermetically sealed glass container but crumpled up inside a zip loc bag
2310486 this was one of only three originals that existed anywhere in the world
2310487 we at first assumed that the president had shit and ejaculated on the constitution at the same time but scientists at the fbi laboratory in washington matched the semen to vice president dick cheney

2310523 one thing ive said now for several years is if a company is telling you about the letter i would ask to see the letter because thats the only way to know what the fda said
2310524 the salient issue is transparency will these letters be shared with the rest of us
2310525 for example why did fda not approve cordaptive what did they tell the sponsor merck we dont know
2310526 many of us at fda would like to see greater transparency
2310527 soon found he had to stop mccain from using his good name

2310530 john mccain is the eddie haskell of politics you can attribute that to me and hell kill me for it
2310531 the beginning of the end of his respect for and friendship with mccain
2310532 he had slipped some highly technical questions to mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
2310533 hurt me more than anything to be set up like that
2310534 you will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in phoenix i announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the state republican party i am told by the party that you still owe them 35 000 and unless you pay all of it or most of it they cannot meet their payroll next wednesday
2310535 a farce mccain famously sponsored a law designed to control special interests grip on washington but at the same time he took money from those interests
2310536 he traces his environmental awareness to the sainted rep mo udall an arizona democrat who took mccain as a young congressman under his tutelage to environmentalists thats like saying you learned about civil rights by driving around alabama with martin luther king jr
2310537 i have always wondered why john mccain has done nothing to fix the problem he must either not see that a problem exists or does not choose to do anything about it it would seem that it would be in everyones best interest to come to terms with the situation and do whatever is necessary to fix it there is so much at risk during my short tenure at avmt i have been surrounded by what on the surface appears to be the ultimate all american family in reality i am working for a very sad lonely woman whose marriage of convenience to a u s senator has driven her to distance herself from friends cover feelings of despair with drugs and replace lonely moments with self indulgences
2310538 that was devastating to me that he brought in a reporter i thought that was crossing the line and it destroyed me
2310539 im sure i would have accepted the offer to go the hospital as well i cant blame lewis but maybe the sight of the legendary mo udall in his final sad days wasnt mccains to share
2310540 you make some excellent points rosemary and i wish that everybody were as concerned about the issue as you are and i appreciate the call
2310541 i believe that rosemary has a bumper sticker that says visualize world peace

2310547 we can improve the squad so we will try to do that we will bring in one more player if we can
2310548 i do not know when but clearly we have problems on the left kewell has gone aurelio is injured and leto cannot get a work permit
2310549 babel is away in the olympic games maybe he can come back and fill that role but i know we can improve in this area

2310566 i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
2310567 of course i mean for a lot of americans including the family that i grew up with i mean its fundamental to how you judge people and human character whether you keep your word whether you keep what is your ultimate word which is that you love your spouse and youll stay with them i think the most important qualities in a president in todays world are trustworthiness sincerity honesty strength of leadership and and certainly that goes to a part of that

2310572 you get these reports on television that its a neck and neck race i would like to see a landslide victory for you and id like to vote in november for a mccain rice ticket
2310573 obama is shallow hes an empty suit he doesnt have the relevant experience to work the country out of its problems and john mccain does

2310575 i think davids got a medal chance in both races but he could be stronger outside the pool
2310576 he could catch a few people by surprise although hes showed hes world class at it the 10k
2310577 in the pool the 1500m is going to be a really hard race there are a lot of guys over eight people who can go under 15 minutes and its going to be a real scrap
2310578 whereas the open water i mean grant hackett wasnt good enough to qualify for it david qualified for it and hackett didnt even though he went for it
2310579 if you become a soldier youll be a general if you become a monk youll end up as the pope
2310580 i hope the chinese government is able to reconsider this
2310581 joey cheek is by no means an out of control radical hes a very serious sober responsible individual and his support for human rights certainly cant be in any way a detraction from the games
2310582 the chinese officials know of my involvement in the past and will hopefully give consideration to my request perhaps on a personal basis
2310583 keep up the efforts to end the ordeal of my fellow hostages and all those who are held in similar conditions in the region
2310584 there were times when it seemed like it would take forever and there were times when it seemed like it had been going on for an eternity but we all always knew that john would be released one day
2310585 its over were moving forward with our lives and i think its important for people to mind their own business
2310586 that line like a tree planted by the water i shall not be moved
2310587 it seemed to sum up what everyone struggling to come back after katrina was feeling i really wanted to bring the city together with that thought
2310588 folk tradition of adapting and transforming songs to serve as anthems to galvanize people in a cause
2310589 everything has changed since katrina even our neighbourhoods arent familiar anymore
2310590 youre talking about kids who lost everything their homes their schools and friends
2310591 for some of these kids this music is all they really feel they have and they are very excited about this project
2310592 were hoping that at noon on the 29th everyone will sing say or shout we shall not be moved
2310593 our sort of design and development philosophy is great games are played and not made we play the game a lot and then say what we think is working what do we want do more of what do we want to do less of and what we want to take out its part of the reason our games take three or four years to make
2310594 i remember originally we tried to literally do it like assassins creed very very free we started play testing it and these advanced pop prince of persia players didnt know what to do they would jump and they would stop and they would try and look around they were overwhelmed by possibility there was a platform there and there and there and there and it was just too much
2310595 so we had to iterate on our level design to make sure you are going to be able to get that acrobatic flow that rhythm of run jump swing off the pole wall jump grab that column
2310596 in the past days however it has become evident that i no longer have a strong enough political base in the congress to justify continuing that effort
2310597 as president i must put the interests of america first
2310598 babies for sale south koreans make them americans buy them
2310599 the problem is that ebay doesnt do any controls it is the first distribution system in the world that refuses to check what its selling but says the brand has to do this for them imagine a big store where the owner says i dont know what i sell
2310600 we have 2 000 people in our company who are dedicated to fighting fraud and counterfeiting
2310601 we have 80 000 trademarks and rights owners who cooperate with us
2310602 but what we want to make sure is that counterfeiting should not be an alibi to protect a traditional and old fashioned way to sell and promote a product
2310603 if these decisions are confirmed then ebay will be obliged to confirm before each ad is posted on the site that the product isnt counterfeit
2310604 this means a big technological change for ebay but it also means they will have to people overseeing that each product is not a fake
2310605 the large majority of child deaths are preventable and its wonderful to know that a simple solution such as knitting a hat can help to save a life
2310606 i hope the fact that such a small action can have an impact will inspire people to take part in this campaign and knit a hat for save the children
2310607 i have forgotten how to knit but would be very happy to join in a knitting circle and learn again with a group of volunteer knitters
2310608 what are we going to do without electricity on saturday
2310609 this was a sensible decision that catered for the needs of worcestershire and herefordshire patients
2310610 why give me these aids medicines i am too hungry and weak to work and care for my family why torture me this way
2310611 it would be more honest for the financial firms to write down to zero the value of these assets with possible positive revaluation if they turn out being worth more than zero
2310612 youre so unimportant to me that id rather talk to someone miles away who i cant even see than pay any attention to you
2310613 doing the works together provided the ideal opportunity to transport extracted clay from the marina just a few hundred yards directly onto site to build the flood defences for new street
2310614 we were assured the plans were in place and that it would be a simple operation to construct the bund with clay supplied direct from the marina
2310615 plans were well advanced with preparations being made to provide accommodation for construction workers in the town as well as a traffic prevention order being put in place
2310616 now it seems that something changed inside the environment agency and its all off until next year
2310617 there is sufficient clay both for the worcester and the upton flood defences and it makes perfect sense to transport the clay directly onto site for both projects doing the works in tandem means that the material can be recycled and only has to be handled and transported once we will work with the environment agency to make sure this scheme happens but it seems to me that the most cost effective time to do the upton scheme is now
2310618 it is quite clear that there has been some shift within the environment agency on the timescale for building these flood defences
2310619 there is considerable frustration that clay from upton marina is sailing up the severn to worcester but not being used to build the towns own defences next door
2310620 spending on renewables needs to be instead of financing coal not alongside it
2310621 you will not leave the table until you eat one piece of each of your vegetables and tuber

2310624 other manufacturers are known to use sony battery cells but only dell and apple computer have been affected by any problems
2310625 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2310626 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2310627 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2310628 this is not an olympics based on unity its an olympics based on injustice imprisonment unfair treatment of journalists and internet bloggers and dissidents
2310629 we stand for the freedom of our fellow human beings and that we realize that the promotion and preservation of liberty throughout the world ensures it here in america for ourselves
2310630 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2310631 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2310632 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2310633 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2310634 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2310635 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2310636 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2310637 ive been in love with the same woman for 30 plus years and as anybody whos been around us knows shes an extraordinary human being warm loving beautiful sexy and as good a person as i have ever known so the storys just false

2310639 landlords wishing to remortgage buy to let properties will find it difficult with lenders demanding sizeable deposits or charging higher rates this could force landlords to re evaluate whether it is worthwhile staying in the sector in the current climate with property prices falling though there may well be many landlords having to sell their investment at a loss
2310640 the cost of remortgaging means many are staying put on their lenders standard variable rate rather than pay a fee of 2 per cent or 2
2310641 i didnt know why they had chosen an english guy for american football
2310642 and besides i dont think them royals can sing or dance but at least i knew who the heck he was
2310643 i didnt understand why they would bring the prince but not his wife queen elizabeth
2310644 thats providing that they are still alive and reasonably ambulatory
2310645 the skeptics would have you believe that americans arent happy enough this number proves that they are not only happy they are putting the bottle where their mouth is
2310646 this is just another sign that our economic agenda is working i was confident that our tax cuts would flow first to the bars and liquor stores of america and then out to the streets and gutters of this great land

2310652 we anticipated that the 2007 trend would continue and consumers would be willing to spend despite all of the economic pressures weve been hearing about heading into the season
2310653 we anticipated that the 2007 trend would continue and consumers would be batty enough to bury themselves even deeper in their personal debt graves despite all of the economic pressures theyve not only been hearing about heading into the season but are actually experiencing every time they go to the mailbox or to the gas pump
2310654 although retailers need to remain cautious the black friday outpouring should have them breathing a sigh of relief and they will be paying close attention to see if consumers continue this strong shopping pace throughout the holiday season
2310655 although retailers need to remain cautious the black friday insanity should have them breathing a sigh of relief and they will be paying close attention to see if consumers continue to pig out throughout the holiday season
2310656 they should be even more consoled because they unload this pestilential paper on visa master card and discover who subsequently pass it through wall street to the pension plans of many of the same consumers who created the ruination in the first place
2310657 a trillion dollars isnt a hurdle one gets to eclipse everyday
2310658 thats why mountebank the friendly bank wants one of its customers to have a shot at adding the twelfth digit to what is now a mere eleven digit number
2310659 in the hopes that one of our indentured visa or master card holders will make the purchase that puts the national credit card yoke over the trillion dollar mark
2310660 we are urging mountebanks customers to swipe until they literally rub the embossing off those cards this holiday season
2310661 because there is a dandy reward if one of our debtors rings what we call the big t bell
2310662 we dont want to be annoying like those magazine publishing sweepstakes and we certainly dont intend to chisel people the way our state lottery does but if one of our clients wins we think he or she will be jumping up and down just like if he or she was on the price is right

2310672 in the beginning the idea started off where my cousin and i would portray thomas and coren starhawk we were going to originally be bounty hunters security guards for fdws however the game wasnt even half of what we made it out to be and a month after signing up to be apart of fdws take note this is one year before the actual release we jumped ship this is when arment who was a friend of mine from mirc came into the picture coren arment and i would create our own guild coren and i had already had a clan of 200 members called ishi intrepid starhawk industries however arment wasnt in on that and wed thought itd be a horrible thing to do to name it the same thing so he brought to the table the starhawk conglomerate we were all going to take on the last name of starhawk and the conglomerate would be basically an rp base since all three of us are roleplayers by the time launch reared its head i was the only one to make it so it was all up to me to start the guild
2310673 nashal is where i met my first few business partners deku narrdurzol and actually allawellyn at this time narr was working on becoming an architect and i had no idea what i wanted to be but i knew what i wanted to do start a guild i recruited a few people including deuce wildcard and austin surge unfortunately we were getting no where fast narrdurzol was my best friend in the game and basically wed just go on adventures together allawellyn took me on my first kill rebel mission i became an imperial the hardway by doing 40 of those delivery missions that only granted 5 fp soon i met reggi when i was a pistoleer and i recruited him for the guild he became narrdurzols apprentice architect and the first guildhall had gone up wick was announced the first master architect and tio was the first guild i had to get in on this so i talked to him and basically he tried to cheat me
2310674 the day of player cities came and the player city limit of tatooine had already been reached and the tatooine city hall i had created was worthless to us we contemplated placing our city on lok due to the fact that you could use tat structures there because it was just more then the city hall it was all of our houses as well that would have to be replaced we thought long and hard and all had a eureka moment lets go back to our planet of origin talus we knew exactly the spot in mind for our new city iwen created the city hall we just barely had the parts to make another and we scouted the spot it was clear of structures it was the flame the namesake of our now beloved city flames hold we placed the city hall in its current location where it rests today allwellyn placed her hall where the shc guild hall currently sits a fact that tom didnt like too much and the shc guild hall was located to the right of the guild hall iwen and myself began production of the first generic mediums and the first streets of flames hold came into being

2310760 and when you play yourself you dont know whos in there doing what we lend some credence to it stats but its not a catch all end all
2310761 even though we stopped the run a little better which we still have to run the ball better on offense we stopped it i think a good part but we still missed so many tackles
2310762 he had a lot of pretty long kicks today and they were solid
2310763 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
2310764 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
2310765 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
2310766 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
2310767 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
2310768 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
2310769 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
2310770 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment

2310772 i am happy to be here with the childress howard guys lally said
2310773 in terms of setup i think we are a little behind the eight ball here
2310774 many of the other teams tested here the monday following the six hour race and we did not have this car then
2310775 people have won from seventh weve run up front in every race with this car there is no reason to believe that we cant do it here our pit stops will have to be faster than everyone else we will need to be patient we also need to be smart and let the other guys bang it out and every time somebody gets pushed somewhere well need to capitalize on it the gt cars are not here so you cant use them as a pick for sure this track is the most difficult track to pass on
2310776 we should have qualified better than p7 unfortunately we had a bad set of tires during todays practice sessions while continuing to make adjustments to the car when we put a new set on late in the second session the problems went away but that put us behind on the setup for qualifying heading into night practice we will continue to improve the car and im confident that bill and joey can drive this car to the front tomorrow night just like theyve done in the last two races
2310777 deze hier is van mijn overleden zoon wauter alles staat nog precies zoals hij ze die morgens achtergelaten heeft

2310780 the n rburgring isn t perhaps the fastest track but it is very demanding the mercedes arena is quite tight and will certainly not be easy to drive with the big sportscar the fast uphill section after the dunlop hairpin should be a lot of fun in the r10 tdi

2310805 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game

2310923 nom i aint hungry i was so hungry i had to stop two miles below here at a farm so i aint hungry no more its what makes me so late my mothers down sick and out of money and everything and i come to tell my uncle abner moore he lives at the upper end of the town she says i haint ever been here before do you know him
2310924 no but i dont know everybody yet i havent lived here quite two weeks its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town you better stay here all night take off your bonnet
2310925 ill rest a while i reckon and go on i aint afeared of the dark
2310926 who done it weve heard considerable about these goings on down in hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed huck finn
2310927 well i reckon theres a right smart chance of people here thatd like to know who killed him some think old finn done it himself
2310928 most everybody thought it at first hell never know how nigh he come to getting lynched but before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named jim
2310929 the nigger run off the very night huck finn was killed so theres a reward out for him three hundred dollars and theres a reward out for old finn too two hundred dollars you see he come to town the morning after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left before night they wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see well next day they found out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten oclock the night the murder was done so then they put it on him you see and while they was full of it next day back comes old finn and went boo hooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over illinois with the judge gave him some and that evening he got drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard looking strangers and then went off with them well he haint come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit people do say he warnt any too good to do it oh hes sly i reckon if he dont come back for a year hell be all right you cant prove anything on him you know everything will be quieted down then and hell walk in hucks money as easy as nothing
2310930 yes i reckon so m i dont see nothing in the way of it has everybody guit thinking the nigger done it
2310931 oh no not everybody a good many thinks he done it but theyll get the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him
2310932 well youre innocent aint you does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up some folks think the nigger aint far from here im one of them but i haint talked it around a few days ago i was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call jacksons island dont anybody live there says i no nobody says they i didnt say any more but i done some thinking i was pretty near certain id seen smoke over there about the head of the island a day or two before that so i says to myself like as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says i its worth the trouble to give the place a hunt i haint seen any smoke sence so i reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to see him and another man he was gone up the river but he got back to day and i told him as soon as he got here two hours ago
2310933 three hundred dollars is a power of money i wish my mother could get it is your husband going over there to night
2310934 oh yes he went up town with the man i was telling you of to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun theyll go over after midnight
2310935 couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime
2310936 yes and couldnt the nigger see better too after midnight hell likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one
2310937 honey i thought you said it was sarah when you first come in
2310938 oh yesm i did sarah mary williams sarahs my first name some calls me sarah some calls me mary

2310943 goshen child this aint goshen this is st petersburg goshens ten mile further up the river who told you this was goshen
2310944 why a man i met at daybreak this morning just as i was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep he told me when the roads forked i must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to goshen
2310945 he was drunk i reckon he told you just exactly wrong
2310946 well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now i got to be moving along ill fetch goshen before daylight
2310947 hold on a minute ill put you up a snack to eat you might want it
2310948 say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first answer up prompt now dont stop to study over it which end gets up first
2310949 which side of a tree does the moss grow on

2310951 well i reckon you have lived in the country i thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again whats your real name now
2310952 well try to remember it george dont forget and tell me its elexander before you go and then get out by saying its george elexander when i catch you and dont go about women in that old calico you do a girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe bless you child when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does tother way and when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss your rat about six or seven foot throw stiff armed from the shoulder like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy and mind you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the lump of lead why i spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle and i contrived the other things just to make certain now trot along to your uncle sarah mary williams george elexander peters and if you get into trouble you send word to mrs judith loftus which is me and ill do what i can to get you out of it keep the river road all the way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you the river roads a rocky one and your feetll be in a condition when you get to goshen i reckon
2310953 git up and hump yourself jim there aint a minute to lose theyre after us
2310954 dont gap and stretch like that huckleberry why dont you try to behave
2310955 say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn hear sumfn well i know what is gwyne to do is gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it agin
2310956 now well start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyers gang everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood
2310957 heres huck finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout him
2310958 yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen in these parts for a year or more
2310959 oh shell do thats all right huck can come in
2310960 stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary
2310961 we aint burglars that aint no sort of style we are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money
2310962 oh certainly its best some authorities think different but mostly its considered best to kill them except some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till theyre ransomed
2310963 i dont know but thats what they do ive seen it in books and so of course thats what weve got to do
2310964 but how can we do it if we dont know what it is
2310965 why blame it all weve got to do it dont i tell you its in the books do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books and get things all muddled up
2310966 oh thats all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them thats the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is
2310967 now thats something like thatll answer why couldnt you said that before well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and a bothersome lot theyll be too eating up everything and always trying to get loose
2310968 how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when theres a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg
2310969 a guard well that is good so somebodys got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think thats foolishness why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here
2310970 because it aint in the books so thats why now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or dont you thats the idea dont you reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn em anything not by a good deal no sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way
2310971 all right i dont mind but i say its a fool way anyhow say do we kill the women too
2310972 well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldnt let on kill the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you fetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more
2310973 well if thats the way im agreed but i dont take no stock in it mighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers but go ahead i aint got nothing to say
2310974 a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson they are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church
2310975 spose we got some genies to help us cant we lick the other crowd then
2310976 why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come tearing in with the thunder and lightning a ripping around and the smoke a rolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it they dont think nothing of pulling a shot tower up by the roots and belting a sunday school superintendent over the head with it or any other man
2310977 why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring they belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says if he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fill it full of chewing gum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter from china for you to marry theyve got to do it and theyve got to do it before sun up next morning too and more theyve got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand
2310978 i think they are a pack of flat heads for not keeping the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that and whats more if i was one of them i would see a man in jericho before i would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp
2310979 how you talk huck finn why youd have to come when he rubbed it whether you wanted to or not

2311177 theres no shortage of delis in this part of south west london but valentina stands out for its great service as well as the pride the owners clearly take in what they do expect the usual italian fare but better and youll soon be well on your way to living la dolce vita
2311178 theyre better known for their presence in bristol but theres something about the atmosphere in this bath branch that draws me in
2311179 with such a variety ofwest country produce available and some of the most discerning restaurants nearby including bath priory and lucknam park theres a real clamour for good food locally and you can get in on the action at chandos whiling away some time browsing is time well spent here
2311180 i love all those crazy meats and cabbage in a jar
2311181 well known for its upmarket bistro style restaurant and relaxed wine bar this serious operation also extends to an expansive deli and foodstore
2311182 browsing among the dry goods charcuterie and fantastic breads and pastries is an absolute pleasure
2311183 tetbury is something of a foodie mecca in the cotswolds
2311184 the chefs table is home to the former michelinstarred chef michael bedford famed for its top notch bistro theres also a small caf cookery school open kitchen and a notincidental deli prepared foods to take away dominate local producers like shipton mill are given due prominence and continental produce is well represented
2311185 in chi chi saffron walden this is the foodie destination
2311186 a family business established for over 50 years what chris chisnall doesnt know about cheese quite frankly isnt worth knowing it stocks both continental and uk cheeses plus all the accoutrements you can shake a fondue stick at you can still get all your cold cuts and produce to round things off but its the cheeses i go there for
2311187 this is a really beautiful shop full of home made pies salads cakes andmany other things
2311188 its friendly and approachable and theyre happy to advise and help
2311189 its extremely small but absolutely stuffed to the gills and has a good deal of charm and character it stocks well sourced and carefully balanced produce with much thought going into good provenance and food miles the focus is on homemade jams and chutneys
2311190 my assistant hattie has to walk past the windows of this deli every day going into work and says it is torture not to stop and look at the fabulous jewel like windowdisplay
2311191 hattie recommends their brownies and i love their fabulous meringues theyre the size of pillows make great pavlovas and are fabulously colourful
2311192 when london got the games believe it or not i cried
2311193 its interesting that some cricketers appear happy to sign up and hang the consequences
2311194 despite that theres still a big appetite for it weve had senior guys as well as guys at the start of their careers who just want to take a punt on it
2311195 anyway facebook has had crushing success while myspace continues to grow
2311196 a proprietary closed cell resin that is neither plastic nor rubber
2311197 international students face increasing pressure to gain work experience in the uk so the flexibility allowing them to remain in the uk for up to two years after graduation will make a real difference to their employment prospects when they return home
2311198 its unfortunate that some critics have seized upon this measure as an opportunity to play politics within the immigration debate instead of celebrating the positive benefits
2311199 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2311200 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2311201 what we have is the sense of real slippage that well you know it may not be 2010 and it probably will be 2015 as if that doesnt matter
2311202 there are loads of opportunities out there particularly if you speak languages other than english each year hotels in switzerland need staff and eurocamp takes on thousands of students the trick is to find work that fits in with the end of the summer term
2311203 a lots of the farming jobs picking fruit etc have largely been taken by workers from eastern europe but there still is plenty of work out there in june and july lots of young people descend on denmark to pick strawberries although the season is quite short the wages are good
2311204 be wary if you are offered what looks like a dream job waiting on dinners in a greek bar it may turn out that you only get tips
2311205 the resident homoeopath katie jermine quizzed me about my diet stress levels and lifestyle she then strapped on a wristband and plugged me into an electronic device called the quantum qxci which scanned my system for vitamins minerals food intolerances toxicity organ function hormone balance parasites digestive disorders and stress levels
2311206 the most advanced medical assessment and therapy device in the world today
2311207 technology attracts clients and charges are higher for practitioners who use state of the art assessment and therapy systems
2311208 the research on the use of such technology shows that when it is well designed it can actually be better than teaching even by the best teachers
2311209 robots cant teach the only effective teaching is by breathing living teachers who can look a pupil in the eye and respond to them
2311210 use phonic knowledge to write simple words and make phonetically plausible attempts at more complex words
2311211 of course children might take to it but that does not necessarily mean its good for them three year olds should not be doing phonics they should do whats normal in nurseries singing rhyming and playing
2311212 a phd is essentially an apprenticeship in research and one of the key skills for successfully completing research is writing papers for publication which can be difficult to master
2311213 doing a phd by prospective publication means you start to generate papers about your research straightaway and it also helps your cv to stand out when it comes to getting a job
2311214 in large parts of europe completing a phd on prospective publication is the standard way of doing things
2311215 it makes sense as people get a chance to acquire transferable skills for their future careers while they are completing important research
2311216 although i have worked throughout my phd ive found through experience that a lot of job applications ask for your publication history so if you have a phd and a bank of published papers it is quite useful and i think it will help me climb the career ladder quicker also if you are doing a part time phd and working somewhere like the health protection agency they like you to publish papers as you are going along because it is good for the agency to be seen to be doing detailed analysis
2311217 i am much more focused and able to write short papers now because you have to get quite a lot of research into a maximum of 3 000 words working out what is important and what to leave out is a key skill and one that i may not have developed if i had been doing a conventional thesis
2311218 to get a post doctoral position at a top lab is always going to very competitive so obviously its good if a student can publish their work but it isnt always possible to get six or seven papers published can be a tall order
2311219 dont just drift into a job in the academic world because it is all that you know there are lots of opportunities beyond it too
2311220 i have been working as a pa since i graduated which has given me a good grounding in business
2311221 i chose my degree subject because i enjoyed the subject but i think it was good preparation for any career i can see myself in hr on a long term basis
2311222 i like seeing how business strategy and the mechanics of an operation come together and being part of that and there are usually opportunities for good career development
2311223 overall its about creating implementing and managing efficient processes to ensure a happy workforce
2311224 the first thing that someone who wants to work in hr needs
2311225 is the cipd chartered institute of personnel and development qualification its not necessarily a requirement for entry but at some stage youve got to get it if you want to progress
2311226 as well at that youve got to have an interest in the business youre working within
2311227 you have to have the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple terms you have to be persuasive and be able to juggle a large number of different elements to your job youve got to be hands on and able to spot potential hr issues going on around you and react to them and youve got to be willing to learn because a lot of complex employment law underpins hr
2311228 she was very clear and articulate concise positive and enthusiastic
2311229 we like to ask competency based questions and her work experience meant she had relevant answers to draw on she was very well prepared
2311230 if i was going to offer any advice it would be to develop a slightly more nuanced answer about why she wants to work in hr
2311231 she talked in quite general terms to begin with though when i questioned her more closely it was clear that she does have a good idea of what hr is about but overall she is a very strong employable candidate and would make a great addition to a team
2311232 but that was good because it was challenging it was good to be able to have a discussion about the issues involved
2311233 im even considering applying for the reed graduate training scheme
2311234 hes english he can play in three different positions but im not talking about him we are talking about a player that can play on the left
2311235 three different positions its a positive thing but im talking about one player i dont say the name
2311236 maybe we will sign one more player if we can
2311237 i dont know when but clearly we have problems on the left of midfield
2311238 i am so moved and proud tonight to see my country put on such an olympic games
2311239 this is the biggest holiday for chinese people this is a chance for the world to meet china
2311240 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
2311241 its got to be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2311242 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2311243 just because it is has been a quiet summer does not mean dic have lost interest they are happy that things have now become low key and they are awaiting developments
2311244 it is normal legal procedure for companies to wait three months after the granting of planning permission before signing the lease
2311245 this is because under planning laws the public have a right of appeal for three months after the planning permission is given
2311246 we expect the lease on stanley park to be signed in a matter of weeks
2311247 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press
2311248 the mcgreeveys clearly had agendas as previously addressed their anger seemed to override any ability to testify credibly or to be reasonable
2311249 our research shows that over a third of people privately renting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at the moment
2311250 on the surface of it this looks like the rental market should be buoyant but if you consider that many of those renting may be struggling to make ends meet it is certainly not all good news for buy to let owners

2311265 when i started a family i realized how amazing it is to get a workout done in 20 minutes its a very efficient workout with the best results ive seen in my life
2311266 its the efficiency of it all were a fast paced world and country if you can get in on your lunch break and get a workout and still eat your lunch are you kidding me
2311267 i wanted to work out and get toned and id had a couple of kids
2311268 im probably in the best shape ive ever been in my life
2311269 its a very efficient workout with the best results ive seen in my life
2311270 it gives you very functional strength endurance and stamina it doesnt require a lot of stuff it doesnt take a lot of space and its cost effective for the person providing it and people taking part in it
2311271 i will be doing a red carpet look that still reflects the simple classic design of the lauren conrad collection but with a black tie twist

2311276 it was a learning curve for all of us and there were a lot of giggles along the way
2311277 but now when you see new characters come to the show and you see those actors struggle with it you realize how its become part of your life so i dont find it tough any more
2311278 it gave me a skill set where you say well what else can this do
2311279 if you obey the rules and design a creature based on biology or something that did exist then people go oooh that looks real

2311297 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
2311298 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
2311299 deep and complex social issues which reach far wider than simply reading a magazine

2311312 as most disabled people are on pensions and money is always an issue this website had the potential to be of great assistance to us if it had been designed correctly
2311313 it appears that the site was put together in a hurry with little thought of allowing disabled people access and most certainly was not tested by disabled people before it came online as any good website should be

2311326 bad news in europe is good news for the dollar and bearish for commodities said phil flynn analyst at alaron trading
2311327 the markets are more focused on the dollar and its newfound strength oil is less looking at geopolitical risk and slowing demand risk mr flynn said
2311328 a few weeks ago when the markets mood was bullish oil would have soared on that pipeline news but supply worries have less impact when the focus and the mood is based on slowing demand
2311329 the public have every right to be concerned about the increased growth of this sort of violence it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2311330 this was a deliberate attack requiring a long chase with revenge in mind this was really arrogant group violence and the result is totally unacceptable it was an attack carried out without any regard to the standards and rules that we live by and no thought for the victim his friends and his family
2311331 i have little doubt that you are a willful individual you are prone to anger you have shown a tendency to use violence when it suits you
2311332 immaturity coupled with a misguided sense of principality and loyalty
2311333 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone on before and no mercy was shown
2311334 martin was a charming loving boy who has left us with cherished memories that will remain with us forever
2311335 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin it was extremely sad to be burying martin at the tender age of 14
2311336 the murder of martin highlights the potentially fatal consequences that may result from carrying knives and other weapons
2311337 this case graphically illustrates the growing scourge of urban posturing which includes the aimless meandering among groups of people who are prepared to if not actively seeking confrontation exploit any pretext in order to engage in aggressive violent behaviour
2311338 we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort but it is important to remember that we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s
2311339 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects with rising mortgage repayments and sky high food and fuel costs it is little wonder that more and more peoples budgets have been driven to breaking point
2311340 these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74m mortgages in the uk
2311341 the possession rate now is similar to that of the late 1990s but remains less than half the rate experienced in the early 1990s
2311342 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2311343 but the real horror is that today struggling homeowners have less protection than in the 1990s but most people dont even realise it
2311344 research by shelter shows 23 of mortgage payers think they would receive prompt state help if they could not pay their mortgage in reality because financial help for homeowners in difficulty was cut after the last housing crash nothing would kick in for nine months which is too late
2311345 we plant trees we sow seeds the land turns green
2311346 beyonc knowles has been a spokesperson for the lor al paris brand since 2001
2311347 it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for f ria hair colour
2311348 there is no doubt that anyone seeing that ad will know that it is beyonc
2311349 skin is lighter than the way im used to seeing her
2311350 advertisers and magazines need to be careful about this even if its just a production process
2311351 it wouldnt surprise me if he had tried to help others thats what he was like
2311352 i always worried about him when he went climbing but i never stopped him doing his dream he was always happy go lucky very laid back and had a very kind nature but no matter what he would never have stopped his climbing
2311353 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope
2311354 the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a lot of metres he had no chance
2311355 they saw their friend falling from the top to the bottom they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late
2311356 i was a pretty fat kid didnt do much other than eat and play computer games
2311357 climbing took over when i was 16 after a trip to the dolomites these last years ive lost my belly and took climbing seriously finding it a vent from life and somewhere to push myself competitively ive learnt a lot about myself some of it good some of it bad climbing is my demon but its also my cure
2311358 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat
2311359 it would be beyond their reach in seconds from that point the end would have been swift
2311360 none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy they would have quickly become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves although i cant exclude the possibility of a shark attacking them drowning is a far more likely cause of death
2311361 my biggest fear was being attacked by somebody who did not want me on the boat i was 160km out to sea with no back up
2311362 i didnt know if someone was going to burst through a cupboard and go at me with a knife
2311363 i must be a heck of a writer to produce a pornographic book without sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex
2311364 it was my hope that my book would develop empathy for this other culture that we know so little about in this country
2311365 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in muhammads life by giving them a voice
2311366 married at nine to the much older muhammad aisha uses her wits her courage and her sword to defend her first wife status even as muhammad marries again and again taking 12 wives and concubines in all
2311367 i do have a problem with the deliberate misinterpretation of history you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
2311368 denise says it is a declaration of war a national security issue
2311369 think it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses sic and the danish cartoons
2311370 it could incide acts of violence by a small radical segment
2311371 georgian troop positions firing on tskhinvali and peacekeepers were suppressed by artillery fire and tank units of the 58th army which are outside the capital of south ossetia
2311372 one hundred and fifty russian tanks armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles have entered south ossetia this is a clear intrusion we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2311373 resistance in tskhinvali is mounting four georgian tanks have been hit on the railway station square
2311374 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is the logic behind the steps we are taking now we will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished those guilty will receive due punishment
2311375 many russian volunteers intended to go to south ossetia and he said it was very difficult to maintain peace in the region
2311376 the only way to stop saakashvili is by bombing tbilisi
2311377 saakashvili with moral support from georgias foreign sponsors decided to begin this aggression
2311378 during the middle of a campaign youre always worried about taking some time off
2311379 i think there are a lot of democrats who are nervous
2311380 i think they thought this election would fall into their laps
2311381 an artificial expectation that he needs to be way ahead at this time
2311382 history is replete with northern liberals who end up losing
2311383 anybody gone into whole foods lately and see what they charge for arugula rocket
2311384 not long ago a couple of hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2311385 i predict that will be translate into a vote for obama
2311386 full of synagogues backroom factories and little grocery stores reeking of pickled herring garlic sausage and onion bread
2311387 a village remote in spirit from the adjacent cosmopolitanism of the great city
2311388 that of the small jewish towns scattered across the lands of eastern europe
2311389 we shared the same sabbaths and festivals sang traditional songs in the same minor key laughed at the same jewish jokes
2311390 fitted into the kind of history we were taught what in any case had history to do with a boys dreams and disappointments
2311391 i have the habit of thinking about that past in collective terms partly because my memories have become generalised but chiefly because in my childhood we were still members of a tribal community
2311392 began to be haunted by the sufferings of jews in europe because these unknown victims took on the features of my own family
2311393 it lacked the vulgarity the noise and overspilling vitality the profuse untidy over ripe garbage strewn squalor of slum life in whitechapel
2311394 the words buzzed around in my brain like a cloud of gnats
2311395 long brown hair sweet smile schoolgirl freckles and plump young breasts i blushed to notice i was shaken by a sweet and terrible violence
2311396 a period of total depression because communism was something to hold on to as a possibility for the future if you lost communism the future held out no hope at all
2311397 you killed our lord dincha so i can pinch yer ball
2311398 i was so nervous i couldnt hold the pen in my hand i knew it was a matter of life and death if you didnt go to a grammar school you went to a factory and the factory was your doom
2311399 did not generalise from this experience the barbarities seemed localised like the stench of decaying offal
2311400 i knew with extraordinary elation that they were a message from inner space
2311401 an awful pedestrian account of every moment i could remember
2311402 snotty nosed kids with whom one had exchanged fairly harmless abuse suddenly appeared buckled and booted in black uniforms looking anything but juvenile as they tramped through the district shouting we gotta get rid of the yids

2311623 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2311624 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2311625 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2311626 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2311627 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2311628 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2311629 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2311630 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2311631 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2311632 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2311633 i think that is going to be one of the most watched games in sports history
2311634 how cool how good is it that were going to play in a game that might be the most viewed game in the history of sport come on
2311635 i remember growing up inner city of chicago shooting at a basket in a schoolyard hoping that one person would watch me and now im going to have a chance to coach my countrys team in front of a billion people are you kidding
2311636 the energy the one thing about these games is that they are shorter games than nba games teams can get hot and stay hot and all of a sudden you find yourselves in a dogfight i think thats a danger you face
2311637 i love the chinese people and i love the fans here so hopefully they wont hate us too long
2311638 when he got hurt i was more concerned with him being healthy than anything because i know how big and how important playing in front of his country is to him
2311639 hes not going to score 100 points and we hope to come close to scoring 100 points
2311640 i think you have to make sure that he doesnt dominate the game
2311641 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2311642 that means that were watched by a lot of people
2311643 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2311644 because i think its important that i give you some specific information
2311645 i was in denial but i had a professor who showed he cared about me by smacking the truth into my head and heres what makes me special i listened
2311646 give the providers what they what two physicians share ways their facilities have improved provider satisfaction
2311647 as we continue to squeeze our health care dollars trying to do more with less the next great opportunity is the enhancement streamlining and integration of the entire system through investments in information technology
2311648 internet technology will help us share important patient information with the healthcare team reduce medical errors to improve patient safety and enhance the patient experience
2311649 before medseek i had to log in to seven different systems that were difficult to navigate just to view a portion of patient information with medseek i login once and can see all patient information by hospital and covering group from anywhere its like a virtual round
2311650 you get to show off what you can do but on the field its just me and undrafted rookie james johnson so its a little bit hard on your legs for the next day
2311651 one of my checkpoints every morning and right now i feel good
2311652 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
2311653 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2311654 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2311655 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2311656 there is concern that they could be used in places where detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions
2311657 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
2311658 these guys are good enough to go out there and get a medal and compete with anyone else in the world
2311659 theyre going to show the heart of america here in beijing
2311660 this has been an extremely hard decision for me to make ive given everything i can to be ready to compete at this olympic games
2311661 its best for me to step down and have another athlete fill my position this is something for me thats very tough because its the end of my career and its not the way i had planned it
2311662 the expectations stay the same the vision doesnt change at all we still feel were medal contenders
2311663 it was like hamlet suspense a thriller and then i killed them
2311664 oh there you are raffy you know you could probably move quicker than that when raising your hand
2311665 now can you come on over here and sit down next to this mri machine
2311666 and um while theyre doing that this nice gentleman in the tweed jacket is going to ask you some questions about yourself and perhaps show you some inkblots while he jots things down in his steno pad
2311667 a lot would have to happen with the people we have down there now for us to not go out and get somebody somebody would have to grab the role really lock into it and prove that we can count on them thats a lot to happen in two and a half months
2311668 have you ever seen a reds team so lifeless so dead so disinterested
2311669 a 5 0 lead doesnt hurt psychologically he knows he can beat us psychologically his team knows it and probably psychologically our team knows it plus a lot of great pitching and a lot of luck
2311670 we had the same amount of hits but that three run homer was the difference
2311671 you hear that the college game is so much faster and that the hardest adjustment for a lot of players coming out of high school is the speed getting used to playing against so many fast guys
2311672 until we come to camp the summer is less about football and more about doing the work individually to make yourself better
2311673 being away from real football practice and running plays for a while i actually kind of enjoy it it allows you to really focus in on what you want to improve on and discipline yourself to put in the time it takes to advance yourself
2311674 weve got the two real veteran guys in robiskie and hartline and then theres a bunch of us competing and working behind them
2311675 right now i dont really concern myself with who is where on the depth chart because that all gets determined by the coaches during camp were just getting started so theres a lot of time left to work all of that out
2311676 and theres a load of talent at the receiver position with the incoming freshmen we have theres also a lot of depth at the position maybe the most depth ohio state has had there in a few years
2311677 dane is a smart player and a very coachable young man who seems like he has just soaked up everything weve thrown at him since the day he got here
2311678 he keeps improving making himself better and as coaches we are excited to see what kind of things he will do in the coming season some players really break out once they get that first year behind them and start to play with a lot of confidence and experience
2311679 it does seem like it wasnt that long ago when i was coming to preseason camp here for the first time
2311680 but in terms of the experiences you go through as a freshman it feels like quite a while ago
2311681 we would never disrespect authority or disrespect brown theres no way in the world
2311682 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2311683 you feel that youre entitled to the favor of god to do things other people cant do
2311684 a pitcher like that boy you cant give him too much leeway he throws whatever he wants to throw at anytime
2311685 im sure psychologically he knows it his team knows it and probably the other team knows it
2311686 it felt like it was supposed to feel when youre out there playing
2311687 i was looking to make a tackle but fortunately for his sake he didnt get to me
2311688 thats exactly what you want your quarterback to do and need your quarterback to do
2311689 if he makes a bad play you need him to come back out there and show confidence to drive the team in for a score
2311690 nearly every week brings news of another act of forced high mindedness
2311691 ill conceived if it is based on the higher than expected profit
2311692 dont be fooled by them they make some debts default so they can increase the value of some cdos collateralized debt obligations just a big accounting trick
2311693 i dont have time to be injured better get further away from that bear
2311694 this is what im doing to get ready for this launch
2311695 well it didnt really work i didnt really get any results yet
2311696 oh i answered that in my ebook go buy it
2311697 i felt as if medical information on the web was more underdeveloped than other areas i was used to spending time on the web with
2311698 ive been building web sites for years and i felt that there needed to be an upgrade on what was available
2311699 in the big picture its an attempt to engage the health and medical communities with web technology something that is only beginning today
2311700 we have a vast repository of content created by faculty and peer reviewed internally
2311701 our goal is to distribute high quality health information to the general public and thats part of harvard medical schools educational mission
2311702 the aim of the site is just to push out information
2311703 its sort of amazing how many insights non health professionals who have personally experienced disease can provide about that disease
2311704 will enough people contribute enough time and energy to make medpedia what it aspires to become
2311705 we will be announcing our numbers when we launch the site
2311706 were saying were not going inside that freedom cage and we expect to be able to go to the pepsi center were going to push that limit yeah absolutely
2311707 i heard some other liberal groups talking about the fact that they wanted to go in there and hang out and camp my suggestion is just shut the door behind them and lock it because theyre part of the problem also were not going in that cage if anything if we went in that cage it would be to tear it down
2311708 i always go back to franklin benjamin franklin who said that if were willing to give up our civil liberties for security we dont deserve either one we need to find that balance and right now the scales arent balanced
2311709 i was sad because i watched the constitution be used as a doormat on the front steps of the federal courthouse it saddened me to see what was happening in my country but it gave me more energy to fight this because its the right thing to do
2311710 im not going to lie theres a section of re create 68 that are more militant minded than other sections but weve agreed that we are going to tamper down our militancy and act in a nonviolent way because right now nonviolence is the best weapon afforded to us
2311711 theyre the fear mongers when denver city councilman doug linkhart is talking about protesters smearing themselves with feces so the police dont touch them that may be some sick s amp m fantasy he has in his mind but its definitely never entered our minds
2311712 the city and the mayor laid down for the democratic party
2311713 the federal court and the laws in this country have moved so far now to the right and the democratic party has assisted them in this move that every american citizen should be concerned about the embarrassment that happened in the courtroom the other day
2311714 the city in their closing arguments made a point to say that we were not willing to negotiate with them on certain issues and theyre right
2311715 weve said this time and time again do not blame us for the confrontational situation that is being created by this government and this local administration we have tried everything we can to make our protests as legal and as nonviolent as possible but the city has taken every step they can to make this a confrontational situation
2311716 were going to vote with our feet and were going vote in the streets were going to take our marches right to the gates of the pepsi center and were going to push the limits of that security zone because sooner or later at some time or another americans need to start resisting and say no enough is enough were going to stand up for our rights were going to stand up for what this country was originally founded on were going to fight for our civil liberties and if that needs to take place in the streets of denver like i said a year and a half ago this will become ground zero for the fight over our civil liberties
2311717 we dont want this confrontation we want to be able to exercise our rights as peacefully as possible but when theyre creating a situation where theyre training every day for violence when they have the national guard put on call to come out and surround the pepsi center you ask me about confrontation you should be asking the city about it
2311718 not true at all vaseline is manufactured right here in the states
2311719 i am having fun and it is a great time it is a little disappointing as id like to win more games than we have you never know what to expect when you come to this level because there are so many new guys coming in out of the draft it has been a fun experience and a learning experience and i tell them i am a rookie too this year so we will all make some mistakes and all get better as the year goes so far that has held true
2311720 lonnie is doing a good job i think one of the surprises is he has looked good at shortstop so i think they are pleased with that offensively he got off to a slow start but you can see it wasnt going to be that way for long he has been hitting the ball great really the last month we are real pleased with the way he is swinging the bat he is playing really well he is learning the game and his body a little bit as playing everyday takes a little out of you so we are trying to pace that a little bit
2311721 i really like ryan he has made a great first impression here we really feel like he might become a sleeper pick for us and we just see some real bright spots with him thats a pick up we are very excited about and we think we stole something there he has been compared to matt brown as there are some similarities there i think he is a better player than even he thinks he is able to become you can see he has a great frame and is real thin he is going to get stronger in our organization with our strength and conditioning program he is learning how to swing the bat more aggressively as when he got here he thinks more like a singles guy and goes the other way but he has a lot of power and great instincts on the bases
2311722 jeremie has played very well there are definitely some things we are going to begin working with him on to smooth out his defense a little bit but offensively he looks better everyday he has been hitting the ball very hard and he is one of our leading hitters
2311723 one thing we have found is that it appears the summers have been slightly warmer in the past 20 to 30 years this is rather a small difference but it seems to be significant
2311724 its coat of ice is now only about 60 per cent as thick as it was at the turn of the century
2311725 no real reversal of the slow warming trend of the past 60 years
2311726 british climatologist c e p brooks estimates an additional worldwide rise of only two degrees in average temperature would melt enough arctic ice to send the sea flooding into much of new york and london as well as countless seaside towns
2311727 there are always critics only those who do nothing have no critics
2311728 taillibert is the kind of architect who built the cathedrals of ancient times
2311729 my wife believes the coronary i suffered in 1977 was due in part to the increasing burden of problems i had to face during 1975 and 1976
2311730 war was on and they actually had to plan for ballistic calculations
2311731 large scale electronic digital computer capable of being reprogrammed to solve a full range of computing problems
2311732 john mary please please call me this is the 10th time ive tried to call you i really need to talk to you please call me back
2311733 john mary this is an emergency you need to call me as soon as you get this message
2311734 hi john mary this is cindy bob i just wanted to let you know i sure appreciate what you did for me call me because i would like to thank you in person
2311735 god loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life
2311736 while i respect campus crusade for boldly and aggressively pursuing its objectives
2311737 i also highlight the ministrys period anti intellectualism its infatuation with large crowds and statistics and the messy ways bright connected his mission to partisan politics
2311738 the next president will have to lead americans of all religious and secular backgrounds and will navigate a range of tough values issues
2311739 won t be barack obama but obama s world tour provided a foretaste of the reception he can expect to receive
2311740 is nothing less than an attempt to nuke obamas religious appeal and credibility into oblivion
2311741 religious left is growing up faster than religious right did
2311742 he really believes that christianity can be a functional impetus towards social change in a liberal direction i dont think they thats what most evangelical christians think of when they think of a basic understanding of chirsitanity
2311743 while i am not endorsing senator john mccain the possibility is there that i might
2311744 barack obama contradicts and threatens everything i believe about the institution of the family and what is best for the nation his radical positions on life marriage and national security force me to reevaluate the candidacy of our only other choice john mccain
2311745 perriello has a great profile in a very liberal district in boulder colo but thats not virginias fifth
2311746 because if we go in there with any other thought theres no chance of us accomplishing our goal
2311747 everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training
2311748 if anyone competes as an athlete he does not receive the victors crown unless he competes according to the rules
2311749 there should be the excitement that you experience when you hope for non spiritual things if we hope less its because our concept of god is too small
2311750 joined us on evangelistic team meetings in local fraternities sororities and dormitories with the thought that they would make contacts and bring into their fellowship the students who responded to the gospel and help follow them up
2311751 the students associated with intervarsity were soon asked by their local director not to be involved with us

2311777 we used to get about one or two repos a month now were seeing one or two a week
2311778 at the very same time that non uk companies like google and apple are free to build market dominating positions online in the uk without so much as a regulatory murmur
2311779 the competition commissions questions have revealed a number of important issues which are outstanding between the parties and which they have indicated they are unable to resolve without further negotiation
2311780 the benefits of investing in collectables as an alternative asset class have never been clearer not only do rare stamps and historical signatures provide a means of diversification and a safe haven in difficult economic conditions but also provide a hedge against inflation
2311781 a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines
2311782 its getting even worse the estate agents are getting people and even those who have already agreed to buy property asking what they should do
2311783 its definitely having an effect anything that makes people unsure about buying freezes the market
2311784 we do have to make sure that we look at what will have the best impact on helping the housing market move again
2311785 in itself may not kickstart the market in the way that people think it might
2311786 we need to make restitution and make it promptly to those investors who find themselves trapped in this auction rate nightmare
2311787 we are providing more free debt advice and are working closely with lenders to ensure that repossession is only ever a last resort but it is important to remember that we are not seeing repossessions on the same scale as the early 1990s
2311788 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects with rising mortgage repayments and sky high food and fuel costs it is little wonder that more and more peoples budgets have been driven to breaking point
2311789 these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74m mortgages in the uk
2311790 the possession rate now is similar to that of the late 1990s but remains less than half the rate experienced in the early 1990s
2311791 with current fears that unemployment is set to grow there is no doubt we are inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
2311792 but the real horror is that today struggling homeowners have less protection than in the 1990s but most people dont even realise it
2311793 research by shelter shows 23 of mortgage payers think they would receive prompt state help if they could not pay their mortgage in reality because financial help for homeowners in difficulty was cut after the last housing crash nothing would kick in for nine months which is too late
2311794 i have been working as a pa since i graduated which has given me a good grounding in business
2311795 i chose my degree subject because i enjoyed the subject but i think it was good preparation for any career i can see myself in hr on a long term basis
2311796 i like seeing how business strategy and the mechanics of an operation come together and being part of that and there are usually opportunities for good career development
2311797 overall its about creating implementing and managing efficient processes to ensure a happy workforce
2311798 the first thing that someone who wants to work in hr needs
2311799 is the cipd chartered institute of personnel and development qualification its not necessarily a requirement for entry but at some stage youve got to get it if you want to progress
2311800 as well at that youve got to have an interest in the business youre working within
2311801 you have to have the ability to communicate complex concepts in simple terms you have to be persuasive and be able to juggle a large number of different elements to your job youve got to be hands on and able to spot potential hr issues going on around you and react to them and youve got to be willing to learn because a lot of complex employment law underpins hr
2311802 she was very clear and articulate concise positive and enthusiastic
2311803 we like to ask competency based questions and her work experience meant she had relevant answers to draw on she was very well prepared
2311804 if i was going to offer any advice it would be to develop a slightly more nuanced answer about why she wants to work in hr
2311805 she talked in quite general terms to begin with though when i questioned her more closely it was clear that she does have a good idea of what hr is about but overall she is a very strong employable candidate and would make a great addition to a team
2311806 but that was good because it was challenging it was good to be able to have a discussion about the issues involved
2311807 im even considering applying for the reed graduate training scheme
2311808 some friends of ours have been going to so in so church recently because our church has had some issues over the music so a lot of our friends are now going to so in so church for the music then coming back to our church for the sunday school
2311809 i will have your music your doctrine your pastor he is entertaining and funny my sunday school and this churches picnics
2311810 i cant believe i didnt think of that this morning
2311811 its a physically demanding job and theres a huge amount of stamina required it can be hard on tour with not enough time to rest or eat or to generally recover and then the show must go on they can be tough times
2311812 i kind of knew what an oboe sounded like but it was real luck of the draw
2311813 my music teacher and i went to look in the cupboard and the only thing there was this very sad looking box held together with elastic bands
2311814 when youve played your shot and you walk with lots of time to think its about how you stay in the right place in your head
2311815 like at wimbledon when youre at match point and youve gotta nail it at an audition whats going to set you apart
2311816 in the orchestra we have a player who is a pilot and people doing all sorts of other things
2311817 i think its because when you start playing a musical instrument its a hobby something you do for real pleasure
2311818 with performers you are talking about egos to a certain extent but when the performance is on its about pulling together about the tension between the individual and the team i just love being part of a team
2311819 i dont think its in a textbook but its all there
2311820 ive actually had the comment oh thats very nice youre a professional musician and what do you do for a living
2311821 you look at me and say wow 23 years but there are people at the cbso who have made it to 40 years 30 is not unusual
2311822 if you find yourself in a relationship with someone who it just really works with you dont need to be constantly searching its like that with an orchestra its your home your musical and spiritual home we dont always want to be stars a team takes different personalities
2311823 theyre negotiated musicians union rates but we get perks as well like pension holiday pay and so on unlike some other orchestras
2311824 we probably do a 40 hour week but some of that will be spent travelling lots of evenings some orchestras go on tour all the time we tour enough that its interesting but not too much
2311825 when youre in the middle of 120 people playing as if their lives depended on it in front of an audience i dont think you can beat it
2311826 we are taking an aggressive approach to selling mooneys in brazil because they are exceptional airplanes that meet the requirements for both pleasure and business flyers
2311827 the interest in mooney throughout brazil and south america is high and we intend to utilize our extensive list of contacts to increase the exposure of these outstanding airplanes
2311828 general aviation is growing throughout latin america and we anticipate enthusiastic interest in mooney throughout this region
2311829 its an ideal airplane for the caribbean region because our average trips are about 500 miles thats how far it is to go from venezuela to the islands with a mooney we can accomplish this trip in under three hours and do the round trip on one tank of gas
2311830 if an issue doesnt even have a snowballs chance in hell of getting an unexpected outcome from a certain process then there is no need to run it through that process
2311831 work on your own article that will count toward any future deletion under wp coi
2311832 the eyes of god for those fully committed to him

2311860 three decades after solzhenitsyns speech where do we find ourselves
2311861 thirty years ago this summer a 59 year old bearded dissident whose writings helped expose and eventually bring down soviet tyranny stood facing rows of robed faculty and graduates at harvards historic yard for its 327th commencement expectations ran high
2311862 solzhenitsyn delivered each line in his high pitched voice in russian
2311863 as it happened this summer i was reading a tattered copy of solzhenitsyns speech at the same time i was studying jeremiah in my devotions i was struck by the chilling parallels between the dissidents words and jeremiahs warning to the israelites
2311864 our concept of a supreme complete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
2311865 the master of this world who bears no evil within himself
2311866 our founders he reminded us would scarcely have countenanced all this freedom with no purpose but for the satisfaction of ones whims they demanded that freedom be granted conditionally upon the individuals constant exercise of his religious responsibility

2311877 having been in the nba for over a decade with much success i personally never found it difficult to be faithful to my wife i dont agree that having a high profile job provides an excuse for infidelity in the sports world you have to make sure that youre conveying to others that youre off the market period yes people will continue to make advances but the onus is on the athlete to remove themselves from any conversation or situation that does not respect their marriage family or relationship
2311878 it is absolutely possible to have a monogamous relationship with a professional athlete my marriage to doug is a testament to that although i am the wife of a professional athlete ive never viewed our marriage on those terms our love and commitment to one another is more important than the money and notoriety that comes with his profession or nba contract

2312038 film can be a much more appropriate way of training architects than the traditional reliance on orthographic representation

2312179 these analyses lay to rest the idea that letting hen harrier numbers increase at langholm meant that other species like curlew lapwing and golden plover were wiped out on the contrary populations of some of these species actually rose
2312180 this is a fascinating analysis of predators and prey which illustrates how hen harrier numbers may limit the abundance of their principal prey the meadow pipit
2312181 the authors rightly note too that while raptors did not appear to reduce numbers of breeding waders any loss of grouse management in the uplands could
2312182 this robust science building on the other important scientific work on langholm in the 1990s provides solid evidence that harriers were not implicated in changes in number of waders at langholm then
2312183 it is important that this sort of monitoring continues within the new langholm moor demonstration project where the evidence base founded on observation and detailed analysis is so important
2312184 small scale wind energy is attracting growing interest and at the carbon trust we are receiving increasing enquiries from organisations considering installing small turbines its vital that people understand the wind resources available to them
2312185 wind speeds vary considerably and since speed is the key determinant of power the performance of small wind turbines is very sensitive to their location this research has shed new light on the best locations for turbines to be installed
2312186 small scale power generation like wind turbines can turn the concerned individual in to an active citizen in the fight against climate change
2312187 we are currently working to ease the planning rules for small wind turbines so more homeowners can install them with the minimum of fuss

2312235 understanding and minimizing quality deterioration is critical for manufacturers as it is a key driver of owner satisfaction and word of mouth recommendations
2312236 it is imperative that manufacturers design models that not only achieve high levels of initial quality but also attain high levels of longer term dependability vehicle models that stand the test of time will help automaker profitability through superior owner satisfaction and recommendation rates
2312237 although automakers have achieved tremendous gains in initial quality and dependability in recent years by specifically addressing customer concerns these particular problems still prove challenging for manufacturers
2312238 the fact that these problems have endured throughout the industry for many years suggests that additional focus on these issues prior to vehicle launch would benefit not only consumers but also automakers through increased customer satisfaction
2312239 the gains in dependability for compact and midsize vehicles are good news for consumers who are downsizing their vehicles due to increasing fuel prices
2312240 consumers who purchase these smaller vehicles benefit not only from immediate gains in fuel economy but also from improvements in long term dependability compared with previous years

2312245 the communist party would never install in chile a system that was contrary to salvador allendes wishes salvador allende was a democrat but i want to emphasize that while salvador allende had democratic principles he also had a socialist ideology and the communist party has forgotten neither of these two ideals
2312246 allende was the greatest of all socialists and he remains in our hearts
2312247 only yesterday socialists were tortured because they defended the memory of allende only yesterday socialists were fired from their jobs because they defended the legacy of allende but today with our proud history and with inspiration from allende we have reconstructed what was destroyed by the dictatorship our great democracy
2312248 you dont represent the people we cant even afford bread and you eat like a fucking king have you seen the price of bread of course you havent you just have your servants go out and buy it for you dont you
2312249 the people have no bread and all you do is give speeches
2312250 for shame i hope that youre disappeared some day so that you learn your lesson
2312251 following the coup i was dragged from my home and taken to the national stadium like so many revolutionaries and i was tortured there i certainly was
2312252 they didnt kill me i dont know why but when i was released i couldnt work for almost twenty years i wasnt banned its just well ive been told it was post traumatic stress syndrome who knows
2312253 ladies and gentlemen the president will now take a private tour of the art galleries please be patient
2312254 she means well but she still hasnt learned to read the mood of a crowd
2312255 a step toward a new form of understanding and doing politics a more inclusive participatory open and transparent politics a politics for and with the citizens
2312256 if he were alive today salvador allende would be a militant socialist and the socialist partys principal figure
2312257 if he were alive today salvador allende wouldnt find anything at all to like about contemporary chile

2312260 i am confident in a favorable outcome allowing the executive order to stand and i am hopeful judge hurst will render a decision on this matter as soon as possible
2312261 however no matter the outcome my staff has contingency plans in place that could be executed quickly to achieve the needed budget savings
2312262 agreeing with the request by judge hurst to delay the implementation of the executive order will not have a financial impact on the expected budget savings from the design plan changes in the agreement with council 94 the co share deductions will be deducted retroactively from the employees paychecks upon the courts decision
2312263 i remain convinced the actions that i am taking at this time are in the best interests of the people of rhode island are fair to all employees and are necessary to fulfill my constitutional and statutory responsibilities to balance the budget i want to again thank all of the employees who have opted to be part of the solution to the states fiscal difficulties agreeing to the terms of the new contract
2312264 i dont want there to be any confusion about what happened with kevin dineen
2312265 i thank kevin dineen for three solid years and we wish him well we offered him the job in des moines but for family reasons he wanted to stay in portland it should be made clear that he did a wonderful job for us we did what we felt was the right thing for kevin dineen
2312266 he had one exceptional outing one good one fair and one where he looked tired hes a big kid goes to net hard i think he has a shot to make the team
2312267 all we wanted him to do is fit in there and hes done that
2312268 we didnt expect to see him do anything exceptional his skill level is obvious
2312269 mitch wahl might have won 80 percent of his faceoffs while i was there and he made other good plays too

2312286 the nano structure silicon thin film transistors are very promising for design of low power electronics however carrier transport in such devices is very complicated and results in electrical characteristics that may not be described by conventional field effect transistor fet models this work reveals the key physical properties of the devices which will help to further optimize and model the devices for circuit design
2312287 this study is a prime example of how leading silicon technologies entrenched in industry can find alternative routes to improve on performance in device characteristics by clever design the role that funding organizations such as epsrc play in supporting this type of applied research is invaluable to the community and most importantly to industry

2312296 the maori people were stripped of their last great estates in the north island for next to nothing
2312297 no doubt to most readers the impression given is of a bewildering and confusing sequence of hearings and partitions and of unfathomable complex disputes between descent groups
2312298 rather than consciously planning to dispossess maori of their remaining lands most liberal politicians i suspect tended not to think about maori at all
2312299 has noted both the rapacity of the process and the extent to which it was mediated by law in a colonising culture in which respect for law was deeply culturally entrenched and the ideology of property was highly developed

2312332 i believe any young lady under the age of 21 should attend the a journey toward womanhood program
2312333 many girls feel like they cant talk to their parents so we talk to our teacher mentors

2312387 the constant desire to have still more things and a still better life and the struggle to obtain them imprints many western faces with worry and even depression the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about
2312388 today well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
2312389 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations
2312390 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror
2312391 a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information

2312433 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2312434 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2312435 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2312436 will allow people to see senator mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2312437 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2312438 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2312439 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
2312440 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for senator mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
2312441 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country

2312445 our results through the first half of 2008 reflect continued progress in the development of our coloncad technology as we work towards gaining regulatory approval in several large markets later this year including the u s and japan during the second quarter we successfully added china to the list of markets where we have received regulatory approval other areas where our coloncad technology has been approved include the european union canada and brazil while we are currently selling in each of these markets we anticipate measurable revenues to start for our coloncad software once we obtain approval in either the u s or japan as we get closer to obtaining regulatory approval in these key markets we have built up our international sales force which has resulted in higher selling general and administrative costs compared to last year
2312446 i am pleased to report that the company completed the repurchase of nearly all of the 6 350 000 shares of common stock authorized by the board of directors in the first quarter of 2008 we believe our current market capitalization does not reflect the true value of our revolutionary technology and have continued raising awareness of our company to the investment community through a proactive investor relations campaign the next six months should prove to be a very exciting time for our company
2312447 we fully support openmokos decision to publish the schematics of the u blox gps receivers

2312449 schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success service and satisfaction in the market we believe our products would be incomplete without them
2312450 one of the freedoms we value the most is the freedom to explore to fully understand the details of complex systems to adapt and enhance them
2312451 we now take our commitment to openness to the next level by releasing our schematics to the public allowing anyone to find out how the system works and how to improve it

2312466 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology
2312467 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2312468 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2312469 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2312470 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened

2312496 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2312497 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2312498 the big media has tried to be responsible and handle this with kid gloves but its clearly getting ready to bust out

2312502 the university does not dictate political opinion for students or faculty
2312503 contradicts or opposes rather than analyzes or discusses fundamental lds church doctrine or policy deliberately attacks or derides the church or its general leaders

2312506 after i got arrested for civil disobedience i went to the office to tell them

2312508 i was really bitter about how i was treated by the culture that was spawned by the honor code and the honor code office
2312509 here i was at byu this was my community of fellow mormons who should have been acting more christian toward me i wasnt shrill about my views i thought people would welcome a dissenting opinion i felt rather shabbily treated by the administration and the student body

2312560 it will be a positive departure from the past eight years of pain under bush and the republican administration
2312561 senator mccain was a prime mover in the senate and a great advocate who caused the war in iraq john mccain and george bush caused the problem in iraq now john mccain wants you to hire him to fix it well thats one way to go
2312562 look they sent an special envoy to sit and talk with iran
2312563 it will be a positive departure from the past eight years of pain under bush and the republican administration
2312564 what can upset hari seldons careful scheme of history eh
2312565 what were seldons original assumptions first that there would be no fundamental change in human society over the next thousand years
2312566 but there was a second assumption a more subltle one seldon assumed that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant
2312567 actually after harvard he went on to teach constitutional law at the university of chicago
2312568 we had an opportunity to provide much more tax relief to millions of hard working americans i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
2312569 academically speaking obama was the very best of the best and mccain barely escaped from college
2312570 while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops there is little reason to believe that this will achieve victory
2312571 its not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time and according to our commanders on the ground adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own
2312572 obama said during the debates and later he would withdraw troops immediately the day after he is inaugurated which is is have people forgotten now obama says 16 month slow withdrawal gt gt this has been and is pres bush stradegy it is already in process gt gt obama was against the war and the surge he gets no credit we dont need a hypocrite flips on foreign policy who lied about his 20yr racist pastor his first time in her life wife proud to be an american say what a guy who said his grandma is a typical white person what does that mean playing politics commanding our troops at a time of war on terrorism from a military family posted by ms fran jul 20 2008 9 26 19 am
2312573 dont give the troops any money to fight the war
2312574 how long will it be until we are attacked again do you have kids
2312575 lol one obama supporter in here claims weve killed hundreds of thousands of iraqis and another claims millions uh according to the un its more like 55 000 nice try though try to get your facts straight or youll continue to embarrass yourselves
2312576 obama has been and will continue to be correct on every issue including iraq iran and afghanistan
2312577 a something related to this john mccain is getting another free ride from the press he announced 36 hours in advance obamas itinerary essentially telling the taliban and al qaida that a high value target would be in their country now this is at least poor judgement by mr mccain but it brings up a whole slew of other questions like who at the state department or whitehouse gave mccain that information why on earth did mccain then announce it to the world at large and why is the msm ignoring this to my mind john mccains endangering mr obamas life to score petty political points is despicable and irresponsible it renders him completely beyond the pale either that or this old coot didnt have any idea of what he was doing either way trusting this old fool with our nations security after this is insane
2312578 i was very concerned that john kerry would win the last election but thank god the american people saw through his flip flops arrogance and sense of entitlement
2312579 why believe what maliki said these middle eastern leaders often say things just to pacify their people when in reality they think something completely different
2312580 history will show it was the republicans who won the war in the middle east
2312581 not a big deal maliki can say what he wants so where is the embarrassment simply means we have accomplished more than we expected and in a shorter time frame
2312582 someone warn crawford texas that their village idiot is coming home soon
2312583 obamas campaign alleges the president is moving closer toward obamas recommendations
2312584 another thing is if obama is elected he will make such a huge mess of the economy
2312585 its amazing how all these liberals wanted mccain to cross over and be kerrys running mate in 2004 now hes a third bush term
2312586 the one who was right in 2002 should be president in 2008
2312587 things happen for a reason you cannot control gods work
2312588 the misfire comes at an odd time for bush foreign policy at a time when obamas campaign alleges the president is moving closer toward obamas recommendations about international relations sending more u s troops to afghanistan
2312589 it is only after the surge that mccain had advocated since 2003 that it was feasible to talk about a timetable they never embraced obamas policy of cut and run when the going gets tough
2312590 forced to embrace obamas policy on iraq because their own ideas couldnt keep up with reality
2312591 to nobodys fool i just came back from a tour in iraq and so did mccains 19 year old son and he has another son in the navy academy
2312592 mccain has been especially supportive of his onetime rival appearing with bush at three events over the past two days in trying to prod democrats into negotiations to include private accounts in a plan to revamp 13

2312594 this new wind farm demonstrates our commitment to dramatically increase the amount of energy we generate from renewable sources helping to cut the uks carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies
2312595 sheringham shoal will be the uks fourth largest wind farm approved to date and will help provide a significant contribution towards our energy targets
2312596 through the planning bill we are also looking to speed up the planning process for developers and improve consultations to make sure wind farms are built in the right places
2312597 this is fantastic news this is a major step forward for both the wind industry and a major step towards delivering the 2020 renewable energy targets
2312598 during winter 2006 07 i saw what i presume was the same seal attacking and killing eiders on numerous occasions and i also found several carcases along the shoreline interestingly as far as i can ascertain all the birds attacked have been drakes
2312599 when attacks are observed in one area they are not seen in the others lending support to the idea that just one seal may be involved
2312600 it seems possible that the attacks are related to declining fish supplies during the winter compared with plentiful supplies of mackerel during the summer
2312601 typically the seal would approach its victim underwater and take the bird from underneath as it sat on the water
2312602 on several occasions the seal appeared to play with the duck much as a cat plays with a mouse sometimes for up to 15 minutes before skinning it by vigorous shaking and eventually consuming the bird
2312603 largely under water but surfacing occasionally apparently to check on the shearwaters proximity
2312604 when about 20m from them he dived steeply and after a pause exploded among the feeding shearwaters scattering them in all directions
2312605 one individual was caught and i clearly saw its fluttering wings in the seals mouth
2312606 after swallowing the shearwater the seal repeated the manoeuvre and succeeded in catching three more with ease in less than two hours
2312607 i see fashion industry speeding up and seeing people buying t shirts for one night im asking myself where it ends
2312608 these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2312609 by themselves rocky terrestrial planets like the earth grow very readily they basically sprout like mushrooms under almost any conditions we think so earths should be quite common throughout the universe
2312610 rather its analogues to jupiter and saturn that we find are rare
2312611 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular
2312612 planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days
2312613 clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2312614 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2312615 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2312616 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2312617 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
2312618 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
2312619 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
2312620 heavy rain in the tropics is often associated with thunderstorms and the same processes will also apply in the uk particularly in summer where intense downpours are fueled by the additional moisture carried by warm humid air
2312621 one of the most serious challenges that humanity will face in response to climate change is adapting to changes inextreme weather events
2312622 its all about allocating working memory to the things that are most important
2312623 our memory is very limited so it has to be used flexibly

2312627 if we can understand how different sexual systems in plants have evolved we can then begin to understand how sex in general evolves
2312628 humans and other mammals generally have only two sexes males and females
2312629 but other species including plants can evolve bewildering arrays of sexual combinations
2312630 i want to take a minute here on this issue because i think senator obama might be a little bit confused yesterday he accused me of having president bushs policies on energy thats odd because he voted for the presidents energy bill and i voted against it
2312631 i spoke up against the administration and congress and senator obama when they gave us an energy bill with more giveaways to big oil and really no solution to our energy problems
2312632 i want to take a minute here on this issue because i think senator obama might be a little bit confused
2312633 anyway my friends just like on the energy bill ive argued for reform and change in washington for years and it hasnt made me friends
2312634 for his part senator obama is an impressive orator i applaud his talent and i applaud his success all americans should be proud of his accomplishments but washington is full of talented talkers my friends and unfortunately on issues big and small what senator obama says and what he does are two different things senator obama says hes going to change washington but his plan is to raise your taxes and spend more of your money its not my idea of a solution that troubles washington in fact it sounds a lot like the problem

2312640 the bible doesnt forbid same sex relationships when there is a commitment similar to traditional marriages
2312641 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
2312642 put his numbers against anyone in baseball and theyre right there if not better
2312643 we knew that was a big inning and he was facing the heart of the order said giants manager bruce bochy noting that lincecum didnt have his best stuff
2312644 he has a way to elevate when he has to
2312645 hes not a thrower out there he was trying to hit spots not power his way through them
2312646 im 100 percent every pitch but im not trying to throw my arm out like people say he said
2312647 i didnt want him to give up a home run on something hanging said molina who called a fastball away
2312648 he felt confident that he could throw a good slider there so thats great i dont mind that
2312649 when he falls behind in the count you think theyll have a good swing but they dont the catcher said
2312650 to me thats what makes him so good he doesnt give in he makes them earn their swings and their hits

2312660 the thing i liked most about today is how much they competed
2312661 the first day of two a days is going to be a challenge to wake them up and go
2312662 the past two days they have been able to wake up and get into meetings and a walk through which is a much slower tempo tomorrow we get to hit the ground running it is going to be a challenge for us as a coaching staff if we dont demand we arent going to get you can guarantee come seven oclock everybody is going to be running around here pretty good
2312663 something they really love to eat is wood but wood and oil are made of the same thing carbon we know in the lab they will eat petroleum we want to find them the best environment in the field the question isnt does it work its about maximising effects
2312664 we want to take it out of the lab and into the jungle
2312665 were starting with them but we want to find mushrooms which naturally like oil if we could develop a strain of mushroom whose particular ecological niche was oil pollution and nothing else that would be our dream
2312666 you cant just put the mushrooms in the oil and expect a miracle
2312667 you need to feed them too we find sawdust is very good and also human hair
2312668 we had a hair delivery this morning and we have high hopes for it its very absorbent and the mushrooms love it were also doing trials with sugar cane husk coconut shell and banana leaves
2312669 mushrooms secrete enzymes to digest food outside their bodies and then absorb the nutrients that the digestion process releases
2312670 the same enzyme mushrooms use to digest lignin a main component of wood is used to digest petroleum
2312671 were afraid people will think this is a miracle solution which it isnt
2312672 we cant do anything about the oil pits in their raw state nothing in nature can deal with that but what we can do is make the soil resuseable after the bulk has been removed then people could regenerate their own patch
2312673 this would be an amazing thing for the people here to be able to remediate their own land
2312674 researchers have long wanted to find a way to move a patients disease into the test tube to develop cells that could be cultured into the many tissues relevant to diseases of the blood the brain and the heart for example
2312675 now we have a way to do just that which means the cells can make any tissue and can grow forever this enables us to model thousands of conditions using classical cell culture techniques
2312676 were taking something that is very traditional and shaking it up a bit
2312677 attitude is crucial our girls are fun charismatic and easy communicators and of course they can load
2312678 not before this summer im from london but im sure ill cope
2312679 grouse moors are not completely alien to me because my parents owned one in perthshire they think this is a great idea
2312680 its a fun idea but in a big year which promises large bags getting the lead off is what guns have in mind
2312681 girls will need to be super fit and by that i mean fit in the traditional sense of the word pulling the trigger and not other things is what most guns will want to focus on
2312682 definitely and i can see us working with partridge and pheasant days too ideally i can also see an office in say cirencester and see where it takes us
2312683 he could be on to something there his idea could have a better chance with low ground shooting
2312684 understanding the dynamics of interpersonal interaction in these patients has already helped us develop techniques which reduce suicide and self harm rates
2312685 they may have the same gut feeling of unfair treatment even when they are generously treated
2312686 there are huge swathes of it and it is very toxic and potentially very dangerous
2312687 it is catered for under the weeds act 1959 and landowners have to remove it if it becomes a problem i always used to pull it up and take it away but there is so much now it is not really worth it
2312688 ragwort is a native part of our ecosystems and directly supports more than 40 other species in addition it is an important nectar source helping to sustain what is left of our natural pollination services
2312689 there is a lot of emotive hyperbole about the dangers of ragwort and this should be viewed with a discerning eye it would be a tragedy if it is pulled out of the ground wherever it is seen
2312690 ragwort although a threat to livestock has an important role to play in the biodiversity of our countryside
2312691 insects absolutely love it and it can happily exist in areas set aside for nature conservation as long as these areas are not next door to grazing animals especially horses
2312692 visually it was one of the most impressive light displays we have seen for some time
2312693 it began with thundery showers on the sussex coast which moved inland during the evening skirting south london and heading on to essex
2312694 i went to the 31st st location but i figure
2312695 it is usually found at the bottom of the river and tends only to appear when other species of crayfish have moved on
2312696 although only turkish crayfish have been affected so far we think it will be only a matter of time before it spreads to the native species and that would be a disaster there are no native crayfish left in the colne but there are still some remnants in the river stour and the river chelmer
2312697 one possible route for the spread of this disease is use of unlicenced crayfish traps the idea of this wild food is much in vogue
2312698 while this is safe to do in parts of the country where native crayfish have already been wiped out in the east of england we are trying to protect one of the last strongholds
2312699 for the first time weve built a sequence from ancient dna that is essentially without error
2312700 we also wanted to know about the history of the neanderthals themselves
2312701 the restaurants are angry at government plans to purge japanese and thai eateries of asian cooks and replace them with israelis as part of a broader program to cut the number of foreigners working in the jewish state israel attracts virtually no immigrants from asia since anyone seeking citizenship here must prove they have jewish family or links to the country
2312702 its the right priority but the policy isnt the right policy for the goal
2312703 that axelrod signed the ketuba a jewish marriage contract at emanuels wedding an honor that usually goes to a best friend
2312704 i find that my conscience will not allow me to continue with business as usual at this point my time and energy must be spent not on olympic ceremonies but on doing all i can to help bring an end to the unspeakable crimes against humanity that continue to be committed in darfur sudans government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these ongoing crimes but the international community particularly china should be doing more to end the continuing human suffering there
2312705 i have the simplest tastes i am always satisfied with the best
2312706 remember when i asked jesus into my heart at christmas
2312707 well hes living there in my heart and im worried about it i mean i dont know if hes getting enough food in there do you think we should have something delivered
2312708 families feel constrained to buy cheaper food that fills you up has more calories fat and salt and fewer vitamins and nutrients but at least gets you from one meal to the next
2312709 we have to be very careful that the same thing doesnt happen in the schools who are facing exactly the same economic constraints that families with modest wages and incomes are facing
2312710 we have unselfconsciously changed the way we order the basic fundamentals of our lives
2312711 one of the best things i think you can do is for every school including those in urban areas to have a garden
2312712 even if you have to put dirt up on the roof of one of your buildings to get it done or break up some of the asphalt we need to teach people again about how food is grown and how it moves from the ground to the table
2312713 the problem with our economy is due to the politicians like clinton and bush
2312714 america deceived from amazon wikipedia and facebook stealing private lands kelo decision warrant less wiretapping and refusing to investigate 9 11 properly they are both guilty of treason
2312715 here is one way to have more healthy children in school who are more balanced self confident studious and in touch with themselves
2312716 if the sorriest so called president in history other than sorry old carter cares so much donate his ill gotten 109 000
2312717 nuts and twigs diets so often promoted by democrat politicians may put people in the grave
2312718 maybe if politicians would stop raising taxes every other day we could afford better food
2312719 yes i would like ketcup with those fries and super size it with a diet coke if you please
2312720 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2312721 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2312722 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2312723 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2312724 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2312725 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2312726 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2312727 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2312728 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2312729 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2312730 we lament that in this case the arrangements established by the vienna convention treaty were not followed
2312731 all your words are true all your righteous laws are eternal
2312732 and when i say family i dont mean theres only a bunch of clowns running around for little kiddies these are national multi level entertainers and performances that will appeal to the biggest and littlest kid in every family i s outstanding family entertainment in a beautiful resort at a great time of year to head to the mountains
2312733 symbole de la provence la lavande s duit autant par son parfum puissant et son pouvoir calmant que par sa beaut ornementale
2312734 so much of the conversation in denver was driven by frustration with the lack of perceived resonance value and importance of what the performing arts do for society
2312735 everyone please turn on your cell phones pdas and notebook computers and point to the url of the webcast concert
2312736 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2312737 boy you skip a day on the john edwards rielle hunter non story and you miss a lot of non news
2312738 who was this man of character and decency we all loved and trusted after all we are asking ourselves sadly we just thought we knew the guy we didnt live and learn its never good to put our heros up on a pedestal lest we place our own selves in a vulnerable position
2312739 i wasnt planning to blog the story otherwise but honestly the more i look at that blur the more it looks like a photoshop filter
2312740 i now have added another question to my list how did they get a picture of him and the baby in the room
2312741 i cant really tell if the photos are genuine based on the small clip online and im surprised the enquirer hasnt posted more than a couple of images but theyre there
2312742 gee do you think the leftist american media could start reporting on this major political scandal yet it is an absolute disgrace that the mainstream media remains silent the national enquirer continues to do the hard journalism the mainstream media refuses to do
2312743 the real scandal wasnt that edwards fathered a baby while married to a cancer stricken wife it was the monolithic refusal of the american mainstream press to even investigate the facts of the story which were with the application of a little legwork easy enough for them to investigate after edwards was caught by the enquirers reporters at the beverly hilton at 2 40 in the morning july 22 the reason for not reporting was theres no confirmation when foxnews confirmed the run in by interviewing one of the hotel security guards involved the reason shifted to we want to see pictures but outside of a few dailies and a few mentions at foxnews there was none customers of cnn cbs nbc abc the new york times time newsweek and the la times where lats blogs editor tony pearce infamously and specifically ordered his reporters not to blog on the topic are still in the dark
2312744 will the los angeles times now deem the story newsworthy or will they like other big media outlets continue to embargo the story because theyve decided that it isnt worth our time to read about edwards conduct and marital infidelities my thoughts and prayers go out to elizabeth edwards and her children may she take john for every last penny however bloggers are reporting on this and it further underscores the fact that the public can and will continue to rely more on alternative news sources because they have had it with the media elites who determine what stories should fly and which ones get buried
2312745 why write about the edwards scandal heres a short clip n save response to those including many friends who argue the edwards scandal shouldnt be pursued or at least pursued too vigorously even if it is true
2312746 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
2312747 the only legitimate reason not to cover this scandal it seems to me is simple sympathy for elizabeth edwards and ive gotten enough emails from anguished and angry members of the msm to conclude with estrich that its the prime reason for the msm blackout reporters dont have to print everything you could conclude that the need to protect mrs edwards her children is so great the karma of enquiring so bad that all of the obvious public interesty reasons for covering the story should be thrown out the window and if john edwards were already so damaged that in practice hed never get a significant public office even if he wants one i might agree but thats a point that clearly hasnt been reached yet a man arrogant and ambitious enough to think he can run for president posing as a loyal husband while keeping his second family secret will be arrogant and ambitious enough to keep hiding under the shield of his wifes illness until he can attempt a comeback if given the chance
2312748 its on the verge of going big time very big time
2312749 the mcclatchy article proceeds to describe how edwards rather than explaining the situation has been avoiding reporters it is appearing that such stonewalling will not work much longer as reputable news sources such as mcclatchy are picking up the story despite showing initial reluctance
2312750 mcclatchys raleigh news amp observer which unlike other newspapers has never declared itself too good for the john edwards love child scandal is first with the angle that will probably at long last propel the sordid tale into the times and washington post and basically everywhere edwards presumed speaking slot at the convention which
2312751 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
2312752 its a very damaging thing the big media has tried to be responsible and handle this with kid gloves but its clearly getting ready to bust out if its not true hes got to stand up and say this is not true that is not my child and im going to take legal action against the people who are spreading these lies its not enough to say thats tabloid trash
2312753 oh yes the buttoned down media will soon be lapping this story up with a spoon see previously the edwards scandal was just an irrelevant trifle about how the maybe next u s attorney general or even vice president had a baby with another woman while his wife died of cancer and possibly paid the mistress hush money and lied to everyone about it but now its about how a speaker at a meaningless convention might distract the media from covering the media event in the way media handlers prefer in other words a real story
2312754 no way no how can the msm ignore this story if he is ousted from his speaker role at the convention they can spin it anyone they want but the simple fact that the story is so controversial that it prevents him from speaking should wake the msm up from their slumber
2312755 dems do what msm wont they are asking about the love child of democrat john edwards when edwards is not in denver later this month i wonder how abc cbs cnn fox msnbc nbc and pbs will explain his absence
2312756 ebp like oprah she has an exceptional ability that most other ebp wish they had the ability to hold the attention of people and make them do like or buy just about anything ebp are constantly fighting at work or any place else to get ahead and or be heard while oprah can tell white people to read a book or buy a cd and they do it without second thought how else do you think jamie foxx sold so many albums oprah not even white people cared about dr phil or racheal ray until oprah said they were acceptable white people ebp like oprah because shes powerful rich and kicked stedmans trifling self out it isnt necessary for whites to comment to an ebp how much they love oprah they already know you do even if the white person doesnt know why
2312757 over the course of his career he wrote for magazines and newspapers such as the international times gandalfs garden sounds the observer radio times and even bike magazine the olivetti chronicles will gather many of these articles as well as unpublished pieces interspersed with peels laconic thoughts on shaving and mike oldfields tubular bells are diary entries letters and commentary from peels family the anthology was edited by peels wife sheila and their four children

2312770 it is possible that cricket a game venerated all over the commonwealth is older than currently thought in fact jesus may very well have played the game or a similar bat and ball contraption as a child himself according to an ancient armenian manuscript
2312771 dr abraham terian recently a visiting professor at the hebrew university of jerusalem as fulbright distinguished chair in the humanities points to a rare manuscript as his source he notes that in the armenian gospel of the infancy translated into armenian in the 6th century from a much older lost syriac original a passage tells of jesus playing what may well be the precursor of cricket with a club and ball
2312772 the most amazing part of the story of the nine year old jesus playing a form of cricket with the boys at the sea shore is that

2312779 sheep and cattle have a large rumen and it is a fermentation vat in the process they produce methane
2312780 kangaroos have a completely different system well not completely different but it is the rate of passage through their system is much higher and as a result they dont produce methane
2312781 we focused on the range lands in western queensland and western new south wales where landholders really dont have many options
2312782 we could reduce our greenhouse gas liability by 3 per cent now there really arent many options ive not heard of any that can do that relatively quickly
2312783 this will save australia 16 megatonnes of methane and methane is a particularly dangerous greenhouse gas
2312784 it is 21 times more damaging than co2 but fortunately it has a shorter time in the atmosphere so if you are to do things to get rid of that methane then you can have a profound effect on our greenhouse gas liability and this is one way to go about it
2312785 if you were to save 16 megatonnes of greenhouse gases this has got a market value at the moment of about 650 million

2312877 tropic thunder cast member everyone is talking about is robert downey jr who plays kirk lazarus a five time oscar winning aussie who dyes his skin black to play an african american soldier
2312878 the joke is an actor who takes himself so seriously that he ridiculously thinks he can immerse himself in this role stiller says
2312879 there were very few actors i thought could do it any sane person would have reservations

2312922 there are over 4 5 million dog bites each year this is an estimate as there is no central reporting agency for dog bites thus breed and other information is not captured out of the millions of bites about 10 20 are fatal each year while certainly tragic it represents a very small number statistically and should not be considered as a basis for sweeping legislative action

2312925 so after some discussions we decided to give the audience what the audience would expect
2312926 the recording of the set made by the incompetent pa guys for a soft drink manufacturer which was a sponsor of the event is mono deadbeat versus monolake in mono nice deep reverbs and dubby echoes all that lovely spaces gone i assume the pa itself was mono too and only our monitoring was in stereo the file i got from the festival also has been limited and loudness maximized all perfect things to apply to a recording if you want to ruin it sonically but we had quite some fun playing this set despite the absurdities we had to deal with

2312957 episode iv a new hope the 1977 lucas directed movie that introduced the world to jedi knights and lightsabers
2312958 the series the epic itself is basically about one man so its very very narrow
2312959 you pass through a lot of things and you look and whats that over there but you never get to look at it this allows us to look at all that stuff which means were not encumbered by this mythological uber story
2312960 we did not make this in a normal way you make an animated feature
2312961 you see more and more artists using that technique using that device to create all kinds of paintings and drawing
2312962 i think youre going to see a big outburst of that in animation as well over the next few years
2312963 and i looked at them on the big screen i said this is fantastic

2312968 i was walking to get a pancake and i heard pop pop pop and they were shooting the ground one of the bullets hit my leg
2312969 everybody was ducking for cover and my wife stopped and the next thing i know she said i got shot
2312970 the suspect was running away no longer posing a threat to the remainder of the crowd but the suspect then took a shot at him
2312971 i heard a snap and a couple two three seconds later another five or six shots
2312972 the guy was running out he ran to my nephew and the guy shot at him its a good thing my nephew didnt get hurt
2312973 security shoot him in the back and he fall down on the ground and they shoot him right on the neck
2312974 its clear that rival gang members look at this as an opportunity to commit their crimes

2312977 federal and state laws prohibit the sale and shipment of animal fighting magazines and videos but amazon com sells subscriptions to two cockfighting magazines that are little more than catalogs of advertisements for fighting animals and weapons that are illegal to sell until the day the hsus filed suit amazon also sold two dog fighting videos in which 18 dogs were actually maimed and killed the hsus will argue that amazons sale of these illegal materials is an unlawful trade practice under district of columbia law

2312981 before the election we said we would do something about villa romana and we have the walls will be coming down
2312982 in relation to advance cairns i said we would review the funding to that organisation weve reviewed it and ive got a new strategic plan ive got a new ceo ive got increased representation and its been transformed into a more regional economic development
2312983 i also said that we would take council to the people and we have
2312984 we have two regions up in mossman and in the douglas shire and will have next months council meeting in babinda so that our southern people are getting the same attention as our northern half of the council
2312985 in relation to development i always said i was in favour of development and that it needs to be sustainable development
2312986 ive actually met with 17 different developer groups to talk about our vision and how we move forward in that time the number of development applications actually went up by 25 per cent than what it was the previous year
2312987 weve got a 250 million dollar budget we employ 1300 people we are the biggest employer in the region and we needed to be working in a way that gave everyone confidence that we could do that
2312988 despite the fact that ive got very different people on council people with different political views and different passions and different goals weve been able to meet together and on many occasions have voted unanimously on key issues
2312989 on rates i said there would be no rate rise beyond the consumer price index i did not know the full situation of councils financial statements prior to coming into council
2312990 weve been working very hard over the last two months to make sure that we look at every single option that there is to be able to balance the budget and keep rates as low as we possibly can
2312991 i believe the protesters were expecting us to have a knee jerk reaction and arrest them and there were several cameras on site to record it
2312992 they wanted publicity but we wanted to keep the focus on the issue and not on kpd
2312993 the protesters were very civil and cooperative and they werent creating any disturbance
2312994 time was on our side we decided to play it cool play it safe and wait until we had resources available and then go down there and place them under arrest but before we could do that they voluntarily disbanded
2312995 were not going to use them in those situations this is a very unique situation and we have to develop unique strategies for dealing with it
2312996 we were not going to use chemical sprays or club them or do anything to them except we were just going to give them more water if they needed it that was our only plan
2312997 we came to the conclusion we have to take matters to a higher level to force the so called authorities to deal with this
2312998 this is the kind of cultural insensitivity we have to deal with every day
2312999 were giving you the opportunity to leave without getting arrested

2313029 since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity i do not understand it myself any more
2313030 to the extent that the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not true and to the extent that they are true they do not refer to reality
2313031 i do not deny the importance of math however its just that i think that science should come first abstract math seems to be the lubricant for hammering square pegs into round holes
2313032 my point is basically that math should be subordinate to empiricism and that the current crisis in cosomology has resulted in no small part from this role reversal
2313033 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2313034 this find will open up an area of paleontological research in the area
2313035 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton like this is unique in romania and a rarity in the world
2313036 it is important because it can give us complete information about the flora and fauna or the era
2313037 it is safe to say that this was not from a meteor shower and almost certainly was not from any kind of meteor at all
2313038 their origin is uncertain but they have the sort of signature that i might ascribe to blasting like mine blasting

2313058 no all worthwhile starbucks should be giving you that as an offer when you order a chai its a standard of corpoate excellence
2313059 my usual starbucks back home doesnt give that as an offer but maybe its just because they know i dont like coffee but even when i go to just any starbucks they still dont ask that it doesnt really matter i guess because i dont like espresso
2313060 okay well they are wrong pause so would you like that served dirty
2313061 uh no im going to choose not to be slutty today

2313080 for too long now we have been robbing ourselves of 50 percent of our potential leaders people who can shape and inspire others the classic distinctions between men and women are no longer relevant
2313081 it is with considerable pleasure that the new london synagogue announces the appointment of rabbi jeremy gordon to the pulpit of the synagogue
2313082 my job description is to be the head coach im here to win games job security is not part of my job description
2313083 the last thing to come is changing of the mindset of winning that is how turnarounds happen we understand this is a new year and a drastically different team we are very focused on what our task is at hand
2313084 when i signed a contract they didnt show me this years schedule
2313085 they showed me last years schedule when we played seven games at home its a little different this year
2313086 it is a tough stretch theres no question about that
2313087 the thing about schedules is and ive grown to live with this the last four or five months the schedule is the schedule and you have to go play
2313088 weve got to establish our offensive line theres no question about that theyre athletic it will be exciting to see how they come about that is a real big question
2313089 weve had a changing of the guard and some of our leadership has surfaced
2313090 it was well received and touched on a lot of things
2313091 you cant rely on talent there is a fine line between a 10 win season and a seven win season we need to focus on all the details in order to win those games
2313092 a lot of our troubles focused on our lack of focus
2313093 we got away from paying attention to the little things not looking at what it took to work together
2313094 he chose to come back to school and we are very fortunate he is a great player and a great leader we are fortunate for somebody like him to be a leader of our team
2313095 i really like the character and the chemistry and the confidence of this football team
2313096 i think theres great leadership across the board on both sides of the football they are as excited to start practices as any time in my memory of my 20 seasons here
2313097 dixon became one of the greatest players ever to put on a uniform at oregon and last season was one of the most dominant players in college football having said that im fairly comfortable and confident with our quarterback position
2313098 its still fresh in our minds and were always going to be thinking about todd were definitely still dealing with it but were slowly getting able to come back and work hard for him
2313099 i love it o line was fun but d line is where i should be i fit there perfect
2313100 i dont look at it as rebuilding year we have a lot of guys who have played
2313101 its hard to lose your front seven and feel comfortable but the silver lining is we have played a lot of guys we dont have complete novices going out there
2313102 it will be a quarterback competition in the truest sense of the word
2313103 this is a mighty man type of conference it is a very physical football conference
2313104 theyre that elephant in the living room and theyve earned it
2313105 hopefully he takes this thing and runs with it knowing that hes the guy and knowing that hes the leader and plays the way he should
2313106 we can recruit anybody to ucla we can go get the finest in the land
2313107 going the whole summer knowing that youre going to be the guy that feels good and you get a little more confidence as the days go on
2313108 john david was very serious and a basically quiet dude who did things consistently right for what seemed like forever
2313109 mark has more energy to him hes a little more outgoing and is a more mobile guy who creates opportunities to make plays for himself hes very competitive hes a great practice player hes got a great arm hes really a fantastic prospect
2313110 they know hes a terrific athlete and they have confidence in him at this position
2313111 we know the deal everybodys got this deal they pay us more and they expect more wins thats the way it is
2313112 we all have the same goal here that weve had every year that coach willingham has been here and thats to win games
2313113 and that hasnt changed and that never will we are going to do whatever we need to to the best of our abilities to make that happen so its not a distraction that we talk about or think about our focus is winning games
2313114 our team has accepted it as a challenge obviously we have one of the most difficult starts because we open with our rival and its also a conference game on the road but if we can do well down there then we think you can do well against the other teams we will play at home
2313115 we have an opportunity to really surprise some people this year the old clich it will be one game at a time but if we attack it that way we have an opportunity to surprise some people and have a very successful year
2313116 its about dictating what you want to do and when you want to do it we want to be the one who possibly has a shot to dictate tempo
2313117 well be balanced we want to run the ball its not a deal where we are pass first run second we obviously want to run the football first
2313118 political news is not as salient as it used to be

2313122 you pass through a lot of things and you look and whats that over there but you never get to look at it this allows us to look at all that stuff which means were not encumbered by this mythological uber story
2313123 we did not make this in a normal way you make an animated feature
2313124 you see more and more artists using that technique using that device to create all kinds of paintings and drawing
2313125 i think youre going to see a big outburst of that in animation as well over the next few years
2313126 and i looked at them on the big screen i said this is fantastic
2313127 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
2313128 no matter how deep i am in this fight no matter

2313143 we dont know whether its the drug or the healthy participant
2313144 we were not aware of the results before they were presented at a d a and i was sitting in the audience and my jaw just dropped
2313145 my suspicion is that when you look at the determinants of mortality which were weight gain and hypoglycemia in that study byetta would be the antimortality drug because its associated with weight loss and less hypoglycemia
2313146 januvia has been effectively marketed in the primary care community
2313147 i think there is some misunderstanding about the relationship between januvia and byetta among primary care providers
2313148 the number of patients in accord that were treated with exenatide was a very small proportion of the total patients in accord and they got exenatide relatively late in the trial

2313159 his 27 years in the u s congress rep tom lantos had two constituencies californias 12th district encompassing parts of san francisco and its suburbs and the ghosts of the jews who perished in his native europe
2313160 we lose a voice for human rights which was in his case unique he spoke always against oppression against persecution against racism
2313161 having lived through the worst evil known to mankind tom lantos translated the experience into a lifetime commitment to the fight against anti semitism holocaust education and a commitment to the state of israel
2313162 as the only holocaust survivor to serve in congress tom was a living reminder that we must never turn a blind eye to the suffering of the innocent at the hands of evil men
2313163 as accusing eckstein of selling the dignity of the jewish people by pandering to christians
2313164 thousands of evangelical christian donors now have a powerful seat at the table of the jewish agency for israel the vanguard of the zionist movement the jewish agency announced last week it has forged a strategic partnership with the international fellowship of christians and jews an organization that depends primarily on conservative christian donors to raise tens of millions of dollars per year to help israel and impoverished jews in the diaspora
2313165 the fear being that some might be motivated at least in part by the belief that the apocalypse and the return of jesus can take place only once jews move back to the holy land
2313166 third rail of the reform rabbinate you touch it and you die
2313167 were going to find out what kind of leaders that this senior class is
2313168 the reason i say that is weve got two recruiting classes that think i come to the university of illinois and go to the rose bowl well thats not how it works the seniors and the juniors theyre going to have to make sure those guys remember what they went through with the 2 10 and 2 9 there was an awful lot of work and an awful lot of heartache
2313169 i really think well be a better team this year
2313170 last year i was limited because of my shoulder you havent seen the real me yet youve seen flashes but i havent reached my full potential yet
2313171 weve got to take advantage of the eight home football games thats something any good football program learns to do is win at home or be difficult to play against at home we have a great opportunity with eight home games to do that i think if youre going to be thought of as one of the big boys youve got to be a consistent bowl team i certainly think we learned that and it will be a goal to get to a bowl game and win a bowl game
2313172 we have a real unusual and rare combination but we still have a relatively young football team this year we have a very experienced football team in a lot of ways so were really optimistic about the way things are going to shake out for us and anxious to get started
2313173 if my reputation is damaged it is upsetting because ive just changed jobs
2313174 ive done things like ive done them anywhere else i guess it takes time for people to see whats really going on
2313175 im not going to guarantee any wins and losses but ill guarantee well be the most well conditioned and disciplined team on the field by far
2313176 first base was a bowl game for us its important that we take a step forward not a step back and move forward with our quest for a championship i do believe thats where were headed
2313177 our goal will be to win a big ten championship this year
2313178 and i have no problem standing up here and saying that
2313179 we made a tremendous change in our program weve gained a whole new attitude i look at last season as we were so close to accomplishing such great things the harder we focus on the little things the more successful we can be this year
2313180 we were extremely physical in our spring practice we tackled as much as the ncaa allowed us to tackle it was the most physical training practice that ive been around as an assistant football coach or part of any program
2313181 they say you never know what you have until its gone i dont want it to be that way our time is now
2313182 the four national championships before ohio states i couldnt name the losers of any of those games there really isnt any credit in getting there
2313183 we didnt finish losing two games prime time games we didnt get over the hump to earn that respect we have to win that big one
2313184 we came in on top and we want to leave on top too every year we try to model after the team in 05 we try to do those things and this year we took it to another level
2313185 he brought in a whole new concept to the big ten as to what we could do
2313186 we didnt have the indoor facilities we couldnt throw the football in the south they could practice year round throwing the football joe came in and started to open up offenses
2313187 this will be season no 44 for me i think im probably as excited this year as i was at no 1
2313188 allan evridge because of the position he has on the football team its kind of his show and hes got to be able to capitalize and be consistent in what he does we kind of want dustin sherer to press the issue a little bit more
2313189 a new state law will require convicted taggers to clean up the mess they make and keep it clean for up to a year will this approach help reduce blight in the l a region
2313190 from the time they get up in the morning and flush the toilet theyre taxed
2313191 they get into their car theyre taxed they go to the gas station theyre taxed they go for lunch theyre taxed this goes on all day long tax tax tax tax tax even when they go to bed you can go to bed in fear that you are going to be taxed while youre sleeping that there is a sleeping tax
2313192 im probably going to try and play three or four guys there
2313193 i want to see who can basically handle division i football and game day speed
2313194 theyre fluid and have good hand skills they have vision and thats what a good back has
2313195 obviously theyre lacking major league experience but hopefully we can keep things fairly simple so they can go out there and let their athletic ability take over
2313196 last year we could throw the ball when we threw the ball we had great play action because they were obviously defending the run i think this year it remains to be seen but i think we have enough quality offense
2313197 we want to defend our conference championship title we know everybody else is going to look at us and see what we did last year and really want to beat us so were going to have to play our a game every game we go into
2313198 he is very quick off the ball and is a natural pass rusher he is also very good against the run
2313199 hopefully it has put a bitter taste in everybodys mouth
2313200 when i talked to the players about the schedule and brought up marshall i think that everybody felt like we went up there and didnt put our best foot forward hopefully this team has learned from that
2313201 i am encouraged with what i see from this football team
2313202 the key is to see how much we can improve from now until aug 30 we have some pieces of the puzzle together but we still have a long way to go
2313203 when the defensive line misses a tackle its second and 6 when the linebackers miss a tackle its first and 10 when the secondary misses a tackle its seven points
2313204 we have the same goals now that we had four years ago but theyre just more attainable now than they were then we return a great nucleus of players and this will be one of the most talented and most experienced teams that weve had
2313205 as you look at this conference the teams that are winning are playing great defense great special teams and controlling the clock
2313206 i feel good about all of the pieces that are in place right now
2313207 we ended the season pretty well last season but the first quarter was just rough for us all last season we have to start games a lot quicker than what we did last year
2313208 i know weve got our program at a certain level and were in the process of going to another level
2313209 boy its a fight every day its a fistfight every day
2313210 i guess that means im getting old or that ill be the next one to get fired
2313211 however they want us to beat them i dont mind if they want us to do it throwing we will do it throwing and if they want us to it running we will do it running we are going to be able to do both
2313212 if you look around this conference a lot of people have scored points
2313213 if we play great defense and dont turn the ball over we will have a chance to win each game thats going to be the key to our success
2313214 our no 1 goal is to compete for the conference championship every year were at a point where these guys believe they can do that and then no 2 how we win is also important we want to be explosive on offense aggressive on defense and we want to be sound on special teams
2313215 i totally understand why they think we should be in last place
2313216 its always been fun to prove people wrong people have been doubting me my whole life id like to overcome what everybody thinks about me and the team and just play hard
2313217 we are making progress in all of the areas that are important but i still think we are a year or two away from being where we want to be
2313218 were always going to be a balanced offense were never going to be a team that tries to line up and run it down your throat every play but we do want to run the football and be more effective than we were last year
2313219 he made some real nice catches and did some stuff out there that really has us excited
2313220 were getting through the period where the players are getting to know us and we are learning about them
2313221 over the next month we will really get to put some schemes in the guys are starting to trust us
2313222 there are always going to be some surprises there are always the guys you think are going to be pretty good and there are a couple guys that you werent counting on that will pop out were just anxious to get on the field and see who is who
2313223 the seniors had three different staffs in their first three years but they have seen how hard these coaches work and they know that were all about everyone getting better we have a very trusting and productive atmosphere
2313224 we know what to expect from the coaches now we know what to expect out of this defense
2313225 its more of a reaction now than us trying to make sure were going through each step and making everything right its becoming second nature for us
2313226 were definitely expecting big things we as a team believe this should be one of the best years that rice has ever had but were looking at it as 12 one week seasons we want to be 1 0 each week
2313227 we know how fast he is and we are thrilled he is here
2313228 if he is not ready he will not be out there but if he is then you will see him out there as a freshman
2313229 smu has a tradition and history of success and it seems like everybody in dallas is rooting for smu to get back to that
2313230 were making way too many mental mistakes its going to come though
2313231 my goals for this team are not in numbers theyre in learning how to win learning how a winning team acts and putting together those intangibles and learning how to handle those things
2313232 the best guy will play and ill try to hang with that guy as long as i can
2313233 it enables you to concentrate on football all day without any interruptions
2313234 after eight days i hope well come back a different team
2313235 i think its actually kind of an honor to be picked third because we didnt have the greatest season last year
2313236 being picked third shows that people think we have talent and can put up a fight
2313237 its going to put a lot of excitement into the game
2313238 i think this scheme is exactly what we needed because its easy to learn and we have the athletes to run it last years scheme was more heads up and this years is more flying around coming from every angle and trying to confuse the offense
2313239 im the type of back who doesnt need that many touches
2313240 ill take my opportunities and make the best of them
2313241 he may be the guy who steps up and surprises everybody on defense
2313242 hes all business he just goes in there and gets it done
2313243 the most common question is how do we replace matt forte and of course my answer is you dont replace matt
2313244 you have to hope that you have someone in line that can be competitive in that position and i believe we do in andre anderson he should be one of the outstanding backs in the conference this season
2313245 we have a better understanding of our players and they know what our expectations are as a staff
2313246 we went into last season with a lot of question marks now we have a very good grasp of what we can and cant do
2313247 youve got younger guys and older guys working out together and trying to get better
2313248 it seems to be rubbing off on everybody you know thats what ultimately helps you to win ballgames
2313249 our goals each season are always the same win a conference usa championship and represent tulane in a bowl game a particular goal we have for this year is to finish we want to play every game until the last play and make sure we finish
2313250 we design everything we are doing offensively behind everything i hated to defend
2313251 we have a multitude of talent when you talk about depth size speed and experience on the defensive line and thats what really excites us
2313252 it will allow us to do a lot more things defensively this year we have a lot of talent and potential up front
2313253 im very excited about this team and the opportunities we have this year we have a chance to accomplish some great things but i can tell you well be in a whole bunch of close football games just like we were last year and were going to have to win all of them
2313254 watchmen are absolutely living up to the hype while the wide eyed
2313255 the spirit meanwhile quieted some of the anxieties of comic book purists who have wondered why exactly will eisners gentle noir needs a
2313256 max payne the upcoming video game adaptation starring mark wahlberg was a flat out hit with surprised fans
2313257 terminator salvation might actually live up to the second half of its title
2313258 rise of the machines and new director mcg has his share of skeptics
2313259 terminator received a huge ovation with its sinister and unsettling look and a story that combines elements of
2313260 the road warrior after the panel i saw mcg backstage and congratulated him on his smooth stage manner he winced
2313261 im just trying to keep my lips shut these days really i want to let my films speak for themselves he said i want to take me out of it i need to do less talking im just trying to grow as a filmmaker
2313262 were only guessing what 8 8 08 is going to bring
2313263 there was a pregnant lady all decked out in a wedding dress who fainted in line
2313264 the asian culture definitely is more attuned to astrology numerology and the good luck thing than western culture
2313265 i hope this isnt going to become a recurring national craze
2313266 and that next year we have to go through this again on 9 9 09
2313267 for chinese the lucky number eight represents getting rich like 7 7 7 in america

2313269 if they dont feel the chi is right they wont buy it
2313270 if youve got an address with sixes and eights six also being an auspicious number theyre very likely to embrace the property
2313271 a lot of the young people i see are highly educated and quite successful in technical fields and yet it seems very important to them
2313272 i had people who said if they could get the number changed they would purchase the property
2313273 the jewish dispensation looked always towards the gospel in like manner the discipline of the roman church involved an inward struggle that became satisfied at last only in the evangelical emancipation of protestantism
2313274 in the very center of the religious life of the catholic church itself as it stood at that time
2313275 the reformation is the legitimate offspring the greatest act of the catholic church and account of true catholic nature itself in its genuine conception whereas the church of rome instead of following the divine conduct of history has continued to stick in the old law of commandments the garb of childhood like the jewish hierarchy in the time of christ and thus by its fixation as romanism has parted with the character of catholicity in exchange for that of particularity

2313279 toen ik wakker werd rook ik een brandgeur de woonkamer stond helemaal in brand
2313280 ik heb direct 112 gebeld en ben naar buiten gerend
2313281 weve been together for a while and weve been through a lot that has strengthened us by testing us
2313282 were a veteran team and its showing weve had four great practices already this week and i dont see that changing
2313283 were really happy about playing seven home games its a very tough schedule but having that many at home gives us a good feeling
2313284 cal poly has everybody back from the best offense in the nation last year they are a great program grambling thats all you need to say period great program the three conference teams coming in here they were all ranked last year they all beat us last year and they all will be good this year but they have to come here even the division ii teams are good coming in here we just love being at home
2313285 i think you saw the way we finished last season we have the makings of a championship team here
2313286 we didnt have any quarterbacks left really we didnt have a choice what to do on offense but we had a great back in byron lawrence and we all bonded together and did pretty good
2313287 now we have two healthy good quarterbacks john hundley drew branch maybe well let them fake a handoff and throw once in a while this year but seriously we feel very good about what we can get done on offense
2313288 its the receivers we have got a lot of speed and skill out there a lot of it is brand new to us and they have to learn how to play at this level but thats what august is for i feel very confident about our receivers
2313289 every one of the offensive linemen we signed we did well we didnt miss there well play most of them if not all of them as true freshmen georgia had three true freshmen playing up front in the sec last year we can do that here and who knows one of them might be ready to start on aug 30 for us we need to have some depth there and i believe with coach jeremy offutt rounding them into shape these new kids will be what we need
2313290 thats not true change in a friendship doesnt necessarily signify its end
2313291 your married friends just arent there for you any more they cant even return a phone call
2313292 whether you let it whisper away gracefully or whether it dies in some sort of conflagration your married friends just arent there for you any more they cant even return a phone call
2313293 is it true that lia and michael got engaged last night
2313294 you know i am sorry i really wanted to tell you myself but time just got away from me
2313295 you know er i tried to call you last night
2313296 you know i had so many people to call my parents my rabbi

2313298 why should you go when youll just sit there being miserable

2313300 the lives best lived are those that are dynamic always moving steadily forward always progressing and growing
2313301 i need friends who are in the same place in their life as me spending time with the marrieds is killing my social life
2313302 i didnt tell you sooner because i didnt want you to put doubts into me
2313303 any time a so called friend is rude cuts you off and lies to you its time to cut your losses and move on you owe it to yourself not to be with people who treat you so poorly
2313304 ill be your friend when i need you but not when i dont

2313310 its one of the most beautiful inspiring places ive ever been to
2313311 i now have a greater understanding and motivation about preserving my jewishness
2313312 i started to think what if i was there what if i had been ripped away from my family
2313313 its so different but so inspiring to be part of that
2313314 i would want to move here and join the army
2313315 being the observant person that i am i watch them anyway
2313316 the government thinks i could be apart of the first line of defense
2313317 it is important that people who work in the industry when they see something suspicious they feel comfortable calling
2313318 maybe that one incident doesnt bring actionable intelligence but that combined with other intel can piece together the puzzle
2313319 the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others his own good either physical or moral is not a sufficient warrant
2313320 the very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts ones right to life liberty and property to free speech a free press freedom of worship and assembly and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote they depend on the outcome of no elections

2313327 at this point all of the illegal immigrants encountered are in one or more stages of immigration proceedings
2313328 we have been in the background all along trying to keep the peace
2313329 we wanted full accountability for everyone involved no matter what level
2313330 as result of our daily talks with dann we were assured justice would come as a result of this case
2313331 the march came about through several people including a radio broadcast
2313332 we flew to memphis and approached the rev al sharpton and his board of directors and told them we didnt encourage any efforts to have 40 000 or 50 000 people march on the city of lima at this time we also contacted every major personality in radio who sought to make this happen in any situation where theres a great deal of emotion like this you cant control that many people in a town this size it only takes one little spark to break out and fully escalate things
2313333 we managed to keep the peace in lima and we were waiting for justice to be served
2313334 we were assured justice and the system would work however when an all white jury was selected we knew that wouldnt happen
2313335 we are in the sprit business not the courtroom business
2313336 all this was done out of the limelight we werent seeking media attention
2313337 our next step is to organize people with whom weve been in constant contact to bring a united coalition of both the white and black community to bring a change in our community and allow justice for everyone not just the privileged and prosperous
2313338 if i forget you o jerusalem let my right hand forget its skill
2313339 i have always set god before me i shall not falter because he is at my right hand

2313341 just who is this edna that you are calling a friend and why dont i know her
2313342 but let all those rejoice who put their trust in you let them ever shout for joy because you defend them let those also who love your name be joyful in you for you o lord will bless the righteous with favor you will surround him as with a shield
2313343 o lord you are the portion of my inheritance and my cup you maintain my lot the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places yes i have a good inheritance
2313344 but as for me i trust in you o lord i say
2313345 why are you cast down o my soul and why are you disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him the help of my countenance and my god
2313346 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart these o god you will not despise
2313347 on any given day some number of those die and on any given day some number of those are born
2313348 the other thing is the speed at which you can move at most big companies if you want to actually get something done you spend more time getting buy in from other people than you actually spend doing it

2313352 as i have walked among the desperate rejected and angry young men i have told them that molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems i have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action but they ask and rightly so what about vietnam they ask if our own nation wasnt using massive doses of violence to solve its problems to bring about the changes it wanted their questions hit home and i knew that i could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today my own government for the sake of those boys for the sake of this government for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence i cannot be silent
2313353 if violence is wrong in america violence is wrong abroad if it is wrong to be violent defending black women and black children and black babies and black men then it is wrong for america to draft us and make us violent abroad in defense of her and if it is right for america to draft us and teach us how to be violent in defense of her then it is right for you and me to do whatever is necessary to defend our own people right here in this country

2313388 the 9 11 investigation must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the world trade center towers and wtc building 7
2313389 as no reports have come to light of any steel framed buildings collapsing due to fire and as all steel framed buildings which had collapsed had done so due to explosive demolition the logical way to have started the investigation of this surprising event would have been to question whether explosives had been used this apparently did not occur the organisations carrying out the investigations clearly selectively collected data and contrived arguments to support the fire theory and ignored contradictory evidence this is in defiance of the scientific method and flouts the ethical standard of behaviour which the public is entitled to receive from their paid servants

2313399 there three times a day at the regular hours of the temple sacrifices daniel went to his room opened his window toward jerusalem and said his prayers
2313400 there are still a lot of requirements and i believe that at least for a single player game like my game the vast majority of these requirements are unnecessary
2313401 i put in a tremendous amount of work meeting all these requirements when i could have put that work into the actual game and made it even a little more polished little bit better
2313402 but i feel like it actually decreases the quality of games because people spend so much of their energy on these things that users dont even really care about
2313403 they also bent a lot of xbla rules in order to help me make the game the way i wanted which was pretty cool of them

2313475 now there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army 1 when ignorant that the army should not advance to order an advance or ignorant that it should not retire to order a retirement this is described as hobbling the army 2 when ignorant of military affairs to participate in their administration this causes the officers to be perplexed 3 when ignorant of command problems to share in the exercise of responsibilities this engenders doubts in the minds of the officers
2313476 thus while we have heard of blundering swiftness in war we have not yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged for there has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited
2313477 the worst policy is to attack cities attack cities only when there is no alternative
2313478 if the general is unable to control his impatience and orders his troops to swarm up the wall like ants one third of them will be killed without taking the city such is the calamity of these attacks
2313479 thus those skilled in war subdue the enemys army without battle they capture his cities without assaulting them and overthrow his state without protracted operations
2313480 your aim must be to take all under heaven intact thus your troops are not worn out and your gains will be complete this is the art of offensive strategy
2313481 those skilled in war cultivate the tao and preserve the laws and are therefore able to formulate victorious policies the tao is the way of humanity and justice laws are regulations and institutions those who excel in war first cultivate their own humanity and justice and maintain their laws and institutions by these means they make their governments invincible

2313493 the house and senate approved a five year reauthorization of the higher education act
2313494 it will nearly double the maximum amount of pell grants by 2014 and will require the education department to collect and publish better data on soaring tuition costs at universities and colleges
2313495 but the idea behind the new reporting requirements is as you might have guessed to shame colleges into slowing down their tuition increases in particular given the current state of their endowments by dragging the
2313496 you can find a side by side comparison of the senate and house versions that circulated in march 2008 article in
2313497 while the legislation touches on an enormously broad range of issues and programs the debate and discussion surrounding the measure focused heavily on the rising prices of college and the increasing difficulty students and families have paying for a higher education
2313498 all these reporting requirements are of course much preferable for colleges than a mandatory

2313529 while the language of the law can be intimidating the concepts are usually quite straightforward lawyers tend to be risk averse and if you delegate to them you will usually stay out of legal trouble but can often compromise your business objectives my goal for the course and for the coaching i give entrepreneurs is to give them sufficient comfort with the legal concepts to feel confident in driving the process to understand the ways in which the law is a constraint but also the ways in which it is a tool that can help you create and capture value

2313534 venture capital firms realize that they make money by identifying promising innovations early investing capital to build the venture and aiding the entrepreneur with his or her business
2313535 weve seen many efforts to transplant the vc model to large corporations to academic institutions and even to governments
2313536 transplanting the vc model into the corporate environment is not a simple process
2313537 success requires that management fully comprehend and embrace the vc model and be willing to drive significant change in critical areas such as compensation systems and relations with investors and boards moreover the company must stay focused on its core business and implement the model without seriously disrupting the parent organization
2313538 in view of the challenges corporate venturing presents it is remarkable how successful some firms have been at adopting it
2313539 while the problems managers face in emulating the vc model are substantial they are not insurmountable
2313540 until 1990 venture capital was like a cottage industry in which people commonly worked on a one to one basis
2313541 then with the late 1990s came not only record inflows of capital but also a trend toward systemization and the evolution of venture capital as a professional service industry
2313542 while being an artisan will necessarily remain part of the industry the trend toward becoming more systemized and professional will surely continue
2313543 this will help dampen the pronounced boom and bust cycles the industry has experienced relative to capital availability and the economy in general
2313544 i think the newfound willingness of venture fund managers to share project participation with other types of investors who can bring different strengths to bear will continue to grow
2313545 their contacts and specific industry expertise for instance can add significant value to a given project

2313629 trinity was an innocent and random victim of identity theft apparently so were four or five other county residents whose names and addresses were stolen and used as addresses on drug packages
2313630 however trinity and our family have not been treated as victims of a crime instead our home was invaded our two beloved labrador retrievers are dead my mother in law and i were tied up for nearly two hours

2313634 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2313635 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel

2313639 publishers will tell you nobody buys plays unless youre going to be able to promote it in the education area or if youre very famous like fugard
2313640 the school education market is driving our focus but it is lovely to be able to offer learners at school something new and interesting roy sargeants play adaptation of cry the beloved country was prescribed for school learners of english at grade 12 in north west province the resulting success has led us to look for other successful playscripts
2313641 i have to like the play otherwise i dont want to work on it
2313642 people either want to have nothing more than a souvenir but quite often people want to be able to go back over parts of the play and to be reminded of what the character said at a certain moment
2313643 also those people who arent going to see the play and can have the opportunity to enjoy it in another form that audience is the one i am currently missing
2313644 if you are number 10 but you drop to 15 nobody cares but if you are one and you drop to two its like oh hes playing bad maybe its the end of his career

2313657 we really need to focus at the convention on unifying the party behind senator obama
2313658 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy
2313659 and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2313660 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
2313661 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
2313662 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
2313663 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
2313664 if guys get too close and start rubbing up against you its just gross
2313665 youll feel them pushing up on you with their lower part of the body and theyll stay there
2313666 they just ignore it or they whisper very quietly dont do that or they wont look at the person and look down
2313667 we have made real progress helping wisconsin residents recover from the 2008 severe storms and flooding
2313668 however with more than 100 new applications for disaster aid being received each day and with disaster grants to individuals being approved at a current rate of 400 000 a day we still have a ways to go
2313669 anyone whose property was damaged by the storms and ongoing flooding between june 5 and july 24 in the 30 declared counties has until sept 15 to register for assistance
2313670 we urge residents not to miss out on available assistance
2313671 the last thing you need in a disaster is misinformation
2313672 and the best way to avoid that problem is to call and ask for yourself just what kind of assistance is available to you
2313673 that we honor the confidentiality and not publicly disclose the existence of these agreements
2313674 that thing you saw in the movie they aint no blues brothers this is the real deal we are the real blues brothers

2313679 want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements take light rail to their government jobs
2313680 mr bush is the triumph of the seemingly average american man
2313681 hes not an intellectual intellectuals start all the trouble in the world
2313682 if theres a fire on the block hell run out and help
2313683 through four decades he has been the living embodiment of innovative exploration in black roots music his frazzled rasping voice is unique his picking on guitar and banjo a ragged delight
2313684 who you are speaks so loudly that i cant hear what youre saying
2313685 there can be little doubt that this issue the proper construction of treaty provisions is sufficiently meritorious to warrant review
2313686 but we dont kill all murderers we dont execute all murderers we do it according to the law
2313687 when your state violates international law to kill somebody it has very negative consequences
2313688 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2313689 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point
2313690 reminding them of the campaign finance law and providing some information as to how to get a refund if thats what they desire
2313691 if it is not illegal for a foreign national to bundle checks it ought to be since its illegal for a foreign national to make contributions in the first place
2313692 we are proud to hold the olympics and we are looking forward to them but we do not feel we have to please anyone or explain ourselves we have our own business like the rest of the world and will do it
2313693 maybe the world has a quaint picture of the old china but we want progress hu tongs might look nice on a picture but they are not nice to live in they are hovels we want better houses better buildings and a better future and this has nothing to do with the olympics
2313694 what people dont seem to understand is that so much of what they see out there really hasnt got that much to do with the olympics
2313695 the olympics merely provided an immutable deadline for some of the infrastructure that was needed to keep pace with other developments it has to be remembered that no country in history has ever undergone the changes that this one is now dealing with
2313696 in the next 20 years between 200 and 300 million chinese will move from the countryside to cities many of them newly developed there was never for a second a question that china would take on the olympics without being sure of what they were doing the olympics may be costing around 20bn but it is just a fraction of the cost of what is happening around the city and the country
2313697 the chinese are looking for world class models for the urbanisation which is going to be vast in the next few years
2313698 for most chinese tibet is simply a non issue maybe down the line there will be a settlement something like home rule but even the tibetans i gather from journalist friends who went up there are saying look clear out well deal with it ourselves
2313699 the chinese are now obsessed with the future and they do realise they have some massive issues like the movement of population the environment economic development there is so much to do they feel that if you mention tibet it is almost like asking them where they are going to put the sofa
2313700 i can see a lot of old china disappearing and i dont really want to see that so many people were moved to make way for the olympics and the old hu tongs are in danger of disappearing
2313701 perhaps a million people have moved in recent years but only a fraction was a result of the olympics
2313702 obviously you do not want to see a culture disappear and i would be very disappointed if that happened
2313703 i believe the chinese have been very clever they know the value of psychology and there is no doubt that the olympics can be important in how a lot of the people here think of themselves
2313704 when i look at it i believe it is facing the future of china not its past
2313705 in the nineties we were all a little in awe of the japanese and a lot of people wanted to copy them well i have to say that in engineering the chinese are better able to absorb the demands of advanced work
2313706 in fact i think in the near future in places like london there are going to be a lot of signs saying things like national engineering company of china
2313707 some historians perhaps the less eurocentric ones estimate the ethnic cleansing of 100 million american indians by europeans of which the british would have been a significant member over the past 350 years thats pretty disgusting too but i dont see chinese people being lazy minded enough to tar the british people and their governments with the same brush
2313708 china is bigger and stronger than europe already it wont be long before we are militarily and economically stronger than the us
2313709 gutanomo bacy should be closed just start executing those who refuse to wear a uniform in combat and hide behind civilians this would save lots of money gas rebates

2313716 an attack would likely leave iran angry more nationalistic fed up with international inspectors and nonproliferation treaties and more determined than ever to obtain nuclear weapons

2313739 students may have underreported their sexual experiences out of fear of the honor code or a sense of shame or embarrassment
2313740 but even so the percent is remarkably lower than the 60 to 70 percent average on other campuses
2313741 there is just as much sex going on at byu as at any other university its just they get married first
2313742 sexual transgression was the most pervasive and persistent problem i had to deal with as a bishop
2313743 i saw it as my calling to help members have a healthy understanding of sexuality it is one of the gifts from loving heavenly parents who are themselves sexual beings
2313744 i really believe its the most important thing i did in my teaching career
2313745 our turnover among teachers and administrators is so frequent in this state
2313746 its where people learn to live together in freedom and respect
2313747 only indeed as it is comprehended in this general process can the particular process by which the salvation of the single christian is accomplished from the new birth to the morning of the resurrection be carried successfully forward he is saved in the church the mystical body of christ and can become complete only as the whole is made complete which he is a part his resurrection accordingly the last result of the organic power of his nature will be reached only in connection with the consummation of the life of the church as a whole when in the fullest and most glorious sense old things shall have passed away and all things become new

2313750 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2313751 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2313752 i actually walked the country to see who i am who i really am but i dont know what the result of that will be
2313753 but for me personally id rather be successful or unsuccessful based on who i really am not based on some plastic ken doll that you put up in front of audiences thats not me you know
2313754 i conclude then that obedience to superiors ceases to be a duty where their works are openly bad and a source of scandal to the whole church where the shepherds are shearers not sheep but wolves not sober but drunken not prelates that give their lives for the sheep but pilates that serve the lusts of others casting forth their net not to catch souls but money

2313762 i was attracted to the in house scene from my early days in private practice there is a more holistic view when you understand the business through from start to finish you can really add value to the company

2313960 while its difficult to draw too many inferences from one months data it appears that frontiers new service is not siphoning any of uniteds existing passengers
2313961 our thought is that frontiers new service has stimulated use by travelers both local and non local that would have otherwise used another airport and driven to from aspen
2313962 if this is the case we realized a significant direct benefit of improved local air service which is fewer cars on the road reduced highway congestion and less vehicle emissions

2313995 we have residents that have lived in atherton more than 40 years along the tracks
2313996 a lot of the concern is that the authoritys board wasnt given accurate information about the relative impacts of the two alignments
2313997 the staff of the high speed rail authority i dont know if id say they cooked the books but they tilted things very strongly to make it look like the peninsula alignment had a lot less impact than it does
2313998 most companies know that it is illegal to bribe public officials either at home or abroad as international conventions from the organisation for economic co operation and development and the council of europe for example make clear but if there is one thing that these diverse antibribery mechanisms have in common it is a shared weakness in policing beyond voicing their disapproval there is little that international bodies such as the oecd or united nations can do to make countries enforce bribery laws but for companies seeking practical hands on advice about how to combat corruption voluntary initiatives are good place to turn
2313999 we have been informed that there is a positive result involving one of our athletes
2314000 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2314001 i didnt say that i said that theyre working it out
2314002 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2314003 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2314004 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2314005 are you truly supporting sen obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2314006 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2314007 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2314008 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it

2314011 if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2314012 trust me i have been doing this for 35 years i know how to protect prisoners
2314013 the judge did what he thought was right we dont agree
2314014 your honor i am asking for your forgiveness it will never happen again
2314015 i respect the heck out of you for taking this case under all this scrutiny
2314016 i apologize this was not at all affront to you or the court i dont believe there is a person who has ever been through this process that respects it more than i do
2314017 my life has been revolutionarily transformed and its transforming in front of the eyes of these media people who dont know me at all
2314018 your honor i ask for your forgiveness it will never happen again
2314019 i think it was most appropriate for judge giles to take action regarding defendant kilpatricks bond considering his most recent behavior judge giles treated this defendant as any other defendant would have been treated
2314020 its a tragedy for the mayor his family and the city
2314021 the defense team can spin it all they want however they have conceded that there is ample evidence to send this case to the wayne county circuit court criminal division we are very pleased that the defense has acquiesced and enabled the process to move forward
2314022 it was all for show if mr hamdan does not go home in december
2314023 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
2314024 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue
2314025 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
2314026 the decision showed what the jury thought hamdan was worth
2314027 there is a perception that trying people in front of the military was going to be a rubber stamp process
2314028 this shows they are conscientious following instructions and are making rational decisions
2314029 the government attempted to inflame the emotions of the panel
2314030 its true there are work opportunities in yemen but not at the level i needed after i got married and not to the level of ambitions that i had in my future
2314031 i personally present my apologies to them if anything that i did has caused them pain
2314032 you have found him guilty of offenses that have made our world extremely unsafe and dangerous
2314033 the government asks you to deliver a sentence that will absolutely keep our society safe from him
2314034 the problem is the law was specifically written after the fact to target mr hamdan

2314036 for so many of my supporters just like so many of baracks supporters this was a first time investment of heart and soul and money and effort and sleepless nights and miles of travel
2314037 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2314038 delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission
2314039 we really need to focus at the convention on unifying the party behind senator obama
2314040 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy
2314041 and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2314042 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
2314043 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
2314044 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
2314045 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win

2314053 hoy tengo una pareja negativa al vih y me dedico a difundir informaci n porque s que con ello salvo vidas sin embargo dice en una sociedad tan machista donde la mujer no puede negociar el uso del cond n con su marido porque es motivo de sospechas o violencia resulta una labor muy complicada
2314054 rompiendo el cond n te puedes embarazar sin contagiar a tu pareja y los avances m dicos han logrado que exista menos de 2 por ciento de posibilidades de que un beb nazca positivo por tanto yo defiendo que cada mujer ejerza la libertad de decidir sobre su cuerpo
2314055 estuve saliendo con un chico y cuando le confes que era portadora del vih me dio un beso en la frente y me dijo que siempre iba a ser mi amigo nunca lo volv a ver ahora tengo una pareja pero tard dos a os en atreverme a decirle mi condici n
2314056 were certainly disappointed we were unable to reach a negotiated settlement
2314057 we continue to believe that the offer we put forward to the union was an extremely fair and reasonable one and it would have made them the highest paid potash miners in the industry
2314058 it does mitigate it in the short term a little bit
2314059 the company simply refuses to move away from the offer that our members soundly rejected
2314060 the company is making enormous profits and it is time to reflect those profits with fair wages pensions and benefits in other words share the wealth
2314061 it seems that pcs would rather work against us instead of with us to chart a way forward

2314065 nobody brings chamber music to the masses like the portland cello project

2314085 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2314086 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2314087 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw

2314095 the supernatural being conceived as the perfect and omnipotent and omniscient originator and ruler of the universe the object of worship in monotheistic religions
2314096 god is a spiritual essence intelligent eternal true good pure just merciful most free and of infinite power and wisdom
2314097 god is the personal spirit perfectly good who in holy love creates sustains and orders all
2314098 while all religions involve a conscious relation to a being called god the divine being is in different religions conceived in the most different ways as one and as many as natural and as spiritual as like to and manifested in almost every object in the heavens above or earth beneath in mountains and trees in animals and men or on the contrary as being incapable of being represented by any finite image whatsoever and again as the god of a family of a nation or of humanity
2314099 a god in the religious sense is an unseen being real or supposed to whom an individual or a social group is united by voluntary ties of reverence and service

2314130 there were reasons to have questions about the surge the president asked all of those tough questions himself the advisers asked all of those tough questions
2314131 iraq has benefited from the surge and the whole region has benefited from the surge
2314132 look im a republican all right sen mccain is a fine patriot and he would be a great president but theres something to be said for fresh blood and i know that there are a lot of very good people who could be his vice president

2314136 they found a curious pattern parents who lost it during games tended to be control freaks and people who measured their own worth by criteria established by others these people feel they need to keep up with the joneses if my neighbors child is playing for the bethesda soccer team my child needs to play for that team too parents who got angry tended to see their childrens sports as a means to bragging rights and sports scholarship rather than as an activity that was enjoyable for its own sake
2314137 as if there arent enough lawyers out there inventing lawsuits now were going to invite the public to do so
2314138 i think this is nothing more than a referral service
2314139 it encourages if not creates lawsuits our countrys courts are clogged with unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits which delay if not obstruct the access to courts of people that really need to get there that have serious legal grievances
2314140 with our system they can either find a lawyer or find out by talking to our lawyers that they dont really have an interest in that case
2314141 i dont think whocanisue com is going to by itself increase the number of lawsuits there are but it may make people more aware of what their rights are
2314142 its a good thing to the extent people are vindicating their legal rights to the extent they didnt years ago
2314143 our study suggests compounds such as sulforaphane may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes

2314155 oil companies to reduce production of crude oil and increased our dependence on foreign oil by an estimated 8 to 16 percent
2314156 china is undergoing this economic boom and is effectively willing to pay any price just by the nature of the market the product is going to seek out the end user that is willing to pay the most and that dynamic is not going to change anytime soon
2314157 when in doubt congress makes something a crime keep in mind that while they are first speaking of 5 million fines ultimately they will be throwing people in prison for economic crimes and speculation which was the hallmark of the former soviet union
2314158 we have bluster threats and measure after measure that would further strangle and regulate production of oil and oil related products congress always tells us that it knows best but once again we see nothing but economic ignorance from washingtons finest for now they have been held back by a filibuster but i fear that such a reprieve is only temporary that congress and the others in political power in this country will not be satisfied until they have fully destroyed the us economy and replaced it with something we thought would disappear when the iron curtain finally fell so many years ago
2314159 when you are in that kind of position as the ceo of one the primary players who have been putting out misinformation even via organisations that affect what gets into school textbooks then i think thats a crime

2314257 nosotros consideramos que el gobierno no tiene voluntad de responder los planteos salariales de los docentes en la reuni n paritarias nos encontramos que los planteos incluso menos importantes vinculados a temas como la licencia tuvimos respuestas sino que se deriv a la conformaci n de comisiones el tema salarial que nos preocupa a 12 mil docentes no fue respondidos nosotros presentamos un documento donde demostramos que la provincia tiene recursos donde se ve que efectivamente hay una importante cantidad de empresas que se est n llevando miles de millones de la provincia mientras que el salario b sico de los docentes es de 1200 pesos y hay preceptores que cobran mucho menos tambi n le planteamos a la ministro el hecho de que mientras en la provincia ocurre esto el gobernador hace campa a con aspiraciones presidenciales a nivel nacional con los fondos del estado con la plata de los habitantes de la provincia

2314261 what does the current rage skin bleaching tell us about our identity
2314262 child slavery in haiti may be the ultimate symbol of a state that has failed its most vulnerable members
2314263 key to ending child slavery in haiti is creating long term economic options for parents and access to quality education for children
2314264 according to the radio news the death of my friend bloneva bethel was the result of a domestic dispute
2314265 playing on the pga tour prepared me for this week
2314266 ive been playing well and its getting better every week i know a lot of the guys and it just feels like another pga tour event
2314267 i thought going out early it was going to be softer on the greens but that wasnt the case
2314268 key milestones were reached for our c2l octreotide goserelin formulation and ngr delivery technology which increased their respective potential values moreover these remarkable achievements allowed us to intensify our divestment efforts to monetize these assets before year end
2314269 this is a core objective of our strategic plan aimed at bringing non dilutive cash inflows to fund the companys r amp d in virology and extend its runway to financing
2314270 just recently we announced merck amp co s decision to suspend the development of ppl 100 mk 8122 pending the outcome of additional work to evaluate other precursors of the drug prodrugs formulation options and back up compounds although this represents a setback our partnership with merck continues and we await their further progress on the program
2314271 it was a struggle i did my best to be ready for the week but clearly im not the harder i tried the worse it got i havent got the focus this week im just not with it
2314272 obviously im still just having a hangover after winning the open
2314273 you would love to try and go with the flow and thats what you try and do but the harder you try the worse you make it certainly that was the case for me
2314274 i am forcing myself to take days off from sailing and tapering my training routines ive reached my fighting weight of 168 pounds for the first time since i was about sixteen years old luckily thats the weight at which i won my first youth champs in seattle in 2000
2314275 why didnt anyone tell me this would be a bad idea
2314276 when i bought andy i said at the time that i think he has a big future in the game i looked at him a good few times last season and i always saw that he wanted to score goals and for me that is a big thing in a player
2314277 my aim is to finish better than last year we finished ninth last year but we just missed out on the top six we were six points off after having had seven defeats on the bounce the aim is to try to be as close to that section when the split happens as we can
2314278 sen specter remains the most respected statewide public official in pennsylvania
2314279 but his age 78 and health problems could make him vulnerable to a challenge from hardballs chris matthews
2314280 theoretical match up there is a large undecided vote and many voters dont know enough about matthews to have an opinion
2314281 his contract at msnbc is up in 2009 and chris spent an extraordinary amount of time in pennsylvania before the democratic presidential primary in april
2314282 i think hes testing the political waters when asked by various reporters he hasnt ruled out running he hasnt taken it off the table
2314283 would chris be the strongest democrat on the board right now probably because of his celebrity and knowledge of politics
2314284 but he has a lifestyle decision to make first and foremost
2314285 certainly presents a very interesting scenario given his appeal and his knowledge of washington
2314286 we are very pleased to report record level of both total revenues and earnings for the second quarter 2008
2314287 the second quarter of 2008 was a busy and fruitful quarter for us

2314292 god make me enlightened so i can understand everything spiritual and know what all people are talking about
2314293 they were so concentrated on what happened before that they were not dealing with the life they had now but it makes more sense to me to deal with the complex situations i am finding myself in today ill leave the past behind so i can handle the present
2314294 were going to use the blood flow the hormone changes to see if with and without acupuncture whats happening
2314295 i basically stumbled upon the treatment of infertility by treating endometriosis
2314296 i think the food is great and i get to experience things that are unique to that part of the world india is a fascinating country and i like the solitude on the plane

2314300 thats okay i signed your name today on that child benefit cheque
2314301 what if someone is shooting something or someone right now and what if we do nothing because its like that case in new york where that woman was beaten or stabbed to death with over 20 people watching because they all thought someone else would call the police what if everyone else thinks its fireworks and its really not
2314302 we should call the police this is getting ridiculous it sounds like its taking place from those houses over there and look at the flash in the street i think theyre doing it right on the street
2314303 its a good thing you didnt call the police huh that would have been an embarrassing 911 call
2314304 well its not like the fireworks are associated with anything logical like the first of july its not even canada day yet are they concerned that it wont get dark tomorrow or something the earths plan to revolve around the sun might fall through
2314305 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children
2314306 i do not believe that we should be spending 55 of every tax dollar on ways and means of killing other peoples children no matter how often they burn our flags
2314307 oh yeah well in china nobody would be able to hear you say things like that cuz they are way worse than here so shut the fuck up

2314322 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
2314323 it might affect them emotionally but if you just look at it its ludicrous suggesting that a pig thinks like a three year old child thats really what i cant get over
2314324 we will not be selling the brand it is not our intent however to sell the vineyards and winery as a going concern

2314339 children do not need to be made to learn to be better told what to do or shown how if they are given access to enough of the world they will see clearly enough what things are truly important to themselves and to others and they will make for themselves a better path into that world than anyone else could make for them
2314340 unschooling my children is enabling me to see them for all they are and all they can become unschooling my children is enabling me to see that life really is for living and exploring and singing and creating and discovering and trying and doing and being

2314380 general shinseki was right that a greater international force contribution u s force contribution and iraqi force contribution should have been available immediately after major combat operations
2314381 trying to eliminate saddam extending the ground war into an occupation of iraq would have incurred incalculable human and political costs had we gone the invasion route the u s could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land it would have been a dramatically different and perhaps barren outcome

2314440 at what about storytelling does the game follow a linear plot or will players be able to choose how things unfold hb the player will have some choices that impact the outcome of the game but we really focused on a strong central narrative that feels true to the star wars films and allows for character development in terms of player choices we also wanted to invest a lot of our energy and effort into gameplay significant choices so you can choose how to rank up and improve your powers or which combos to buy for example at other than vader and bail organa will we see any other familiar characters from the movies or the sw expanded universe hb yes princess leia has a pivotal role as does the emperor we also have a few surprise cameos from the films and the expanded universe which i think will show fans that we are committed to staying true to the existing continuity wherever possible

2314484 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2314485 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2314486 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2314487 the abc article noted that she is not ruling out having her name placed in nomination this is actually a pretty substantial bargaining chip to have in her back pocket if you look at the mechanics of having your name placed in nomination
2314488 but what about the last 8 years of fiscal irresponsibility and incompetency
2314489 how come the democrats dont want oil drilling off the coasts
2314490 afford medicine or my brother and sisters not be able to go to college so you can have the satisfaction of hillary winning in eight years
2314491 womens issue also he is the divider by alienating the clintons who built up the party in the 90s he is sounding more like a spoiled brat who just wants to live off the older democrats successes
2314492 no matter what you did say fabricate exaggerate allude to conjure up pass along shout whisper fantasize publicize propagate proliferate cause tears about cause fears about stomp your feet over scream your fears over pollute dilute spin fold staple or mutilate hillary the end result will be the same its going to be obama
2314493 he later clarified that he didnt mean cash grants but his initial words were awfully vague
2314494 if you dont nominate me as your veepee i cant still be the spoiler at the convention it is a threat by hrc and it may do great damage to party cohesion if this threat is carried out i support her been consider for the vice presidential candidate but her resort to blackmail is pathetic
2314495 own democrate party do you really think hillary cares about you or women or her passion for health care taht obama wants the same thing and will give hillary to be head over that and all will get it
2314496 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
2314497 i feel theres hope now that hillary may get the nomination
2314498 one reason why this will never happen it would completely sour clintons chances of ever being the nominee again
2314499 if i am going down obama is coming down with me
2314500 turned me around and started kissing me and that was a real shock i first pushed him away i just told him no he tries to kiss me again he starts biting on my lip and then he forced me down on the bed i just was very frightened i tried to get away from him i told him no he wouldnt listen to me
2314501 i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2314502 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
2314503 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2314504 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2314505 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2314506 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
2314507 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
2314508 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time

2314510 the face of every one that passes by me is a mystery
2314511 it is the phantom crowd of the words the fragments the beginnings of lines from which the poet in the deserted streets wrests the poetic booty
2314512 to endow this crowd with a soul whose encounters with it are the experience that he does not tire of telling about
2314513 how men lived even next door neighbours as we say yet still strangers not knowing each the others name

2314516 poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars mere globs of gas atoms i too can see the stars on a desert night and feel them but do i see less or more the vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination stuck on this carousel my little eye can catch one million year old light a vast pattern of which i am a part what is the pattern or the meaning or the why it does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it for far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined why do the poets of the present not speak of it what men are poets who can speak of jupiter if he were like a man but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammonia must be silent
2314517 mr audens poem only confirms his lack of response to natures wonders for he himself says that he would like to know more clearly what we want the knowledge for we want it so we can love nature more would you not turn a beautiful flower around in your hand to see it from other directions as well
2314518 natures ways in the animate and inanimate world together for they are one is rarely expressed in modern poetry where the aspect of nature being appreciated is one which could have been known to men in the renaissance my lament was that a kind of intense beauty that i see given to me by science is seen by so few others by few poets and therefore by even fewer ordinary people

2314521 my lament was that a kind of intense beauty that i see given to me by science is seen by so few others by few poets and therefore by even fewer ordinary people

2314557 i wouldnt walk in that clubhouse if god told me to willie
2314558 im not sure if theres ever been a dodger with dreadlocks
2314559 for so many of my supporters just like so many of baracks supporters this was a first time investment of heart and soul and money and effort and sleepless nights and miles of travel
2314560 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2314561 delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission
2314562 we really need to focus at the convention on unifying the party behind senator obama
2314563 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy
2314564 and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
2314565 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
2314566 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
2314567 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
2314568 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
2314569 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
2314570 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2314571 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2314572 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
2314573 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
2314574 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
2314575 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2314576 now that theyve met me they can see i dont have two horns and a tail
2314577 what does the current rage skin bleaching tell us about our identity
2314578 child slavery in haiti may be the ultimate symbol of a state that has failed its most vulnerable members
2314579 key to ending child slavery in haiti is creating long term economic options for parents and access to quality education for children
2314580 according to the radio news the death of my friend bloneva bethel was the result of a domestic dispute
2314581 i wish i could find a way try not to cry
2314582 the mainstream churches dont care because they are republican and the synagogues dont care because the prisoners are arabs
2314583 a state that we treated as a common good is being treated as a trophy to be seized by the rulers freedom and independence to which we tried to point the way are not accompanied by a sense of solidarity especially towards those who are weaker and poorer insults and squabbles fill our political stage and ruin the citizens trust in the government institutions which should protect the law are becoming tools in the hands of the rulers and we are witnessing serious accusations that they are being abused
2314584 attached to my country fed with her spiritual heritage and its history unable to imagine any other country where i could breathe freely i loved and served it with all my strength i am a jew i see this as a reason neither for pride nor for shame i appeal to my ancestry only in one single case when i encounter an anti semite nevertheless i would like to leave just this one honest testimony i am dying just as i lived as a good frenchman
2314585 seriously yes im pretty sure i sat here just to ruin your day
2314586 this is the song that never ends it just goes on and on my friend
2314587 in fact they did not put emphasis on the manner of death in this way nothing on death by shooting and injury by bullet or role that firearms would play
2314588 so the material question now is where did the used bullet shell come from
2314589 the taking of the keys by khairi is a gap in the prosecutions case and seems to have been connected to some kind of understanding with tonny
2314590 now the utter coincidence is that the bullet shell was found in the vehicle and dsp khairi who took the keys to the vehicle was senior officer in charge of logistics and armoury in the utk
2314591 primulapathi cannot conclude that the donors of the dna on the items in question was the same person or that they only shared the same maternal lineage
2314592 because the bigger the pool of population who could have shared the same mtdna with t5 the further away the probability that he or she is somewhat directly related to that donor

2314594 oh lord thy sea is so great and my ship is so small have mercy
2314595 the current jail is not in good shape but when its broken down we cant afford a new jail
2314596 if we build a new jail of the capacity of 450 we will fill it fairly quickly we will have to pay for food and medical expenses and we cant afford the people we have now
2314597 it seems it would be better to use the money for a new jail instead to keep the jail population down
2314598 use that money for an intensive treatment center to turn people around or for kids and juvenile offenders so when they get older they can hopefully turn their lives around
2314599 the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
2314600 want americans to move to the urban core live in tenements take light rail to their government jobs
2314601 theres going to be a little bit more of the passing early on just to get a look
2314602 it is through their contributions that australia continues to be a free and fair country today
2314603 i was in the royal australian air force for ten and a half years
2314604 i was initially a member of the engineer cadet squadron at raaf frognall in canterbury in victoria where i obtained a bachelor of engineering in manufacturing systems engineering from royal melbourne institute of technology
2314605 after graduating i was then posted to an aircraft depot at raaf richmond where i became officer in charge of general engineering maintenance flight
2314606 my final few years in the raaf were at headquarters logistics command in melbourne where i held positions in the directorate of aircraft engineering then the directorate of logistics quality planning and evaluation
2314607 dad got his medal 50 years after he was over there
2314608 he did national service with raff in england and during his time served two years in bahrain in the persian gulf
2314609 the summer games youtube channel is the ideal first stop for fans because it provides a comprehensive view of whats going on in beijing
2314610 contributing media organizations have their fingers on the citys pulse and theyre sharing the action with a worldwide audience through one location on youtube
2314611 as the official photographic agency of the international olympic committee getty images is poised to offer comprehensive coverage of the worlds most prestigious sporting event

2314617 its tough to turn on the radio or the television these days without hearing someone hawking foreclosure bargains but more often than not these lists are outdated or inaccurate including homes where the owner might have simply missed a few payments or that are already under contract
2314618 we wanted to make sure that the data we offer interested buyers matches whats actually available and has as much information as they need to decide whether its a consideration in their home search process
2314619 the boardvantage board portal was a clear choice for us offering as the most complete suite of functionality for our directors and corporate secretary staff and by expanding use to our executives we can further improve the information flow to our directors essential in a high growth environment
2314620 we are proud to count berry petroleum among our growing roster of energy companies
2314621 they have shown themselves to be in the vanguard of corporate governance by extending their use of boardvantage to their executive team
2314622 obviously im incredibly thankful to rockstar for the opportunity to be in this game when i was just a nobody an unknown quantity
2314623 but its tough when you see grand theft auto iv out there as the biggest thing going right now when theyre making hundreds of millions of dollars and we dont see any of it i dont blame rockstar i blame our union for not having the agreements in place to protect the creative people who drive the sales of these games yes the technology is important but its the human performances within them that people really connect to and i hope actors will get more respect for the work they do within those technologies
2314624 for instance our contracts say nothing about the use of voices for promotional purposes over the internet
2314625 the first g t a iv trailer generated something like 40 million hits online and thats my voice all over it and i get nothing if that were a radio spot i would have same thing for the tv ads i recorded those lines for the game but now theyre all over television its another gray area
2314626 so we would have the 50 pages of screaming 10 pages of being shot 10 pages of being thrown off a roof 20 pages of being burnt alive just screaming
2314627 while we are making solid progress installing new pollution control equipment at our jeffery energy center the loss of the production during the installation of this new equipment is very costly
2314628 i really feel like i enjoy swimming now more than i ever have i enjoy competing more than i ever have
2314629 i had literally just breast fed my daughter got on the blocks and got ready to swim
2314630 i didnt know what to expect so i was pleasantly surprised
2314631 i couldnt count the number of people who came up to me at that meet and said it would be great to see someone our age at the olympics
2314632 whos going to believe me if im just getting a urine test
2314633 she showed up without a lawyer without an agent without a coach
2314634 and withstood probably the worst cross examination of any of the other athletes
2314635 the science is not at the stage where we can give a 100 guarantee to any athlete that they are clean
2314636 but if they arent clean then they would have to be a fool or a huge risk taker to do a program like this
2314637 the guy who invented them is great friends with my coach who is also german
2314638 after talking to him and learning more about them why not take a product where you know the person who made it and know exactly what is in the product why take a chance with something on the market where you dont know if its tainted or not
2314639 because it helps my recovery and its not illegal so why not
2314640 so in the water its not about power but more about making my stroke more efficient
2314641 i decided to become an open book and asked to be tested in any way they want to show im clean
2314642 i understand if i just sat there and said i passed my tests that people wouldnt believe me ive gone beyond the call of duty to prove im clean but you are guilty until proven innocent in this day and age so what else can i do its a real bummer
2314643 i feel like i have so many middle aged women who look up to me i want them to feel proud and feel like they can do what they set out to do
2314644 this is a big country and each province has different economic interests to be pursued internationally
2314645 i think recognizing that flexibility and supporting and using the strengths of the provinces who understand their economies perhaps better than any federal government could thats just wise its good policy and its good for the country
2314646 this bar is way too small for a pool table
2314647 wow thats cool theyd put a pool table in such a small bar

2314660 we will be following up on the issue closely including looking at reports submitted by halcrow
2314661 it was a collective decision by the government to use carbon fibre straps but the task force will study the damage while our engineering forensic experts will investigate the cause of the cracks
2314662 i am an ordinary person no comment it is unfair for me to make any comments as there is already a minister
2314663 only the minister should be able to say what should be done he has already gone to the site he made a statement and i have read it
2314664 there are many things in my head i will only answer if there is an inquiry from within
2314665 i wont say anything about it that is the desire of the public let the government do what it likes i have no comments on it
2314666 we advised them not to use carbon fibre straps because of its limited ductility but the department proceeded with using the carbon fibre straps
2314667 a painfully stretched out global recession over the next couple of years
2314668 i live in a world where crisis management is the norm not the exception and you learn a few things
2314669 you learn never to underestimate the destructive power of negative feedback loops
2314670 policy change in washington d c has been too little too late
2314671 in a crisis like this leaders have to be much bolder
2314672 poor countries are recapitalizing the rich countries its a complete change
2314673 it was one thing to invite people to thrive on their own another to tell them to suffer on their own
2314674 an outstanding information book beautifully written and produced with a fine balance of illustration biographical and historical detail and insight into the creative process all through the viewpoint of a child whose humanity makes it true

2314677 historical fiction at its finest the plot speculating on the childhood adventures of sherlock holmes is well constructed fast paced and embedded with details superb characterization is accompanied by witty dialogue and the authors love of vivid descriptive words
2314678 a gem of a picture book delighting in the warm relationship between brother and younger sister lively watercolours explode across the pages adding detail and humour to the powerful simplicity of the text the words sing as they are read
2314679 it was clear john kerry is thinking big about the future in more ways than one
2314680 tokbox has an impressive and very loyal and energetic user base
2314681 the company is executing well and its service offers consumers a variety of great features that strongly differentiate tokbox from competitors we are excited to be investing with our partners at seqouia in a company we believe has the potential to be the next big thing in web communication
2314682 this is more evidence of the unravelling of anglicanism without a clearly agreed biblical foundation all the goodwill in the world cannot stop the inevitable break up unity without truth is disunity
2314683 on behalf of all canadians id like to extend my deepest sympathies to the victims and their families

2314690 when all is said and done great britain is an island france the cape of a continent america another world
2314691 as illinois attorney general i am deeply troubled by this ideologically motivated effort to effectively overturn state protections intended to help women access basic health care and make fully informed responsible and medically based health care decisions at a time when so many americans including millions of illinois residents are struggling to obtain and afford health care and millions of women are in need of publicly funded family planning a regulation that puts ideology and politics over critical healthcare needs is unconscionable and reckless i strongly urge you to reject this proposed regulation
2314692 no one in our firm knew better how to engender and reciprocate the type of loyalty and dedication that bill had with his clients
2314693 he wasnt the stereotypical tax lawyer either he was outgoing brilliant iconoclastic and collegial a potent combination of qualities that earned him the respect of all of his colleagues
2314694 at this point hes probably more inclined to play wide midfield for us while robbie and ekpo are gone
2314695 he can play alejandros position in a pinch he can play guillermos position and he can certainly play both flank positions he helps us with his versatility and at the end of the day its going to be competition and whos playing best will be out there
2314696 a word is bad if it is ambiguous to such a degree that it leads to misunderstanding for me the perfect example of such a word is
2314697 but right now im pretty focused on going out there and playing well
2314698 i think the excitement and things like that would set in more if i stepped away and looked at it but right now in the midst of preparing to play well im going out there and thinking i have a job to do and im going to go out there and play as hard and as well as i can
2314699 the emotion that goes on its kind of like being in the press box as opposed to being on the field
2314700 you can feel and see the emotion that goes on in a game and you can see how guys respond to stressful situations you cant get that in the box and you dont get that on tv either
2314701 i feel bad not giving you guys good answers to this
2314702 but my reaction is not its just this is my job ive prepared a long time to play football this is what i do for a living i expect to play well
2314703 ill come into the office and say dont say anything i dont want to know
2314704 when you watch the olympics youre often on the edge of your seat but if you already know who won you might as well go mow the lawn and watch it later
2314705 our first responsibility is to dispense the information when something comes down the pike were obligated to share it
2314706 i once gave away the ending to the sixth sense on the radio so perhaps im not as sensitive to this issue as i should be
2314707 its a prepackaged human interest feature that runs in the evening
2314708 people are still going to watch the highest grossing movie of all time is titanic most of those people probably knew that ship was going down and they went to see the movie anyway
2314709 if you really make an effort you could probably stay away from the results but even if you avoid the media you run the risk of hearing about it from your other people

2314718 microsoft is one of the only vendor s with top enterprise search and business intelligence reporting capabilities it offers strong support for aggregation summarization search engine and dashboards transactions across distributed data sources and long running transactions are also strengths for microsoft
2314719 we saw a 35 percent improvement in throughput on the system that we upgraded to sql server 2008 with no code changes on our end

2314722 they bought us kentucky fried chicken and filmed us eating it

2314724 a sacramento judge on friday said state officials do not have to rewrite the ballot summary describing proposition 8 the gay marriage ban voters will consider in november
2314725 the court is not willing to fashion a rule that would require the attorney general to engage in useless nominalization
2314726 it certainly must have been a rodent of unusual size to cause such a massive outage
2314727 i am very disappointed with the press statement issued by the itf regarding the cas ad hoc division in beijing decision
2314728 i find the mentioned statement shocking harming and damaging to my reputation due to the inaccuracy of its content
2314729 but if it didnt have that chip i would be asking 150
2314730 when the sois stood up we were basically hiring terrorists
2314731 a lot of them would prefer doing that because it gives them power of carrying a weapon and providing security
2314732 he had a bad background and it finally caught up with him
2314733 as an opportunity to play both sides of the fence usually the guys at checkpoints
2314734 at first there was no open conflict but there was open verbal conflict
2314735 on payday i hand the money over to the national police supervisor and he hands the money to the soi leader and that guy hands the money to soi members
2314736 were gonna continue to pay the soi guys until the government takes over or until they transition into other jobs
2314737 these sons of iraq will eventually go away and now the most important thing is to find jobs for all those individuals
2314738 its just as important providing jobs as it is security
2314739 currently the relations are getting better with the support of coalition forces
2314740 if the coalition forces go back to the states i am afraid i dont know what will happen between those two elements
2314741 bariloche s a pretty decent place to live with some nice hostels
2314742 i understand how to write tests for your code but my code is different
2314743 we are very pleased with our second quarter 2008 financial results
2314744 kerastick revenues increased 39 year over year driven by a 32 increase in u s revenues our quarterly non gaap loss improved by 1 8 million or 88 and our quarterly cash burn was reduced to 0 2 million we continue to make significant progress in leveraging our income statement driven by growth in levulan
2314745 we also achieved two key operational milestones during the second quarter of 2008 with the launch of our kerastick product in brazil through our partner in latin america stiefel laboratories and the completion of all patient treatment regimens in our acne phase iib clinical trial subsequent to the end of the quarter we announced that nicomide will no longer be marketed as a prescription product we are currently executing on plans aimed at bringing the product labeling into compliance under dshea and maximizing the value of the nicomide brand
2314746 for the remainder of 2008 we will focus our efforts on the continued growth of our core pdt business we believe that we are still in the early stages of market penetration with levulan and that there exists significant upside potential both in the u s and international markets
2314747 do it now or hell eat your head and your mommys head
2314748 to give completely to give up to the point of ruination
2314749 method and apparatus for capturing and authenticating biometric information from a writing instrument
2314750 maybe using lighter fluid wasnt such a good idea but it was an accident all the same and the wasps are gone
2314751 i was born in taiwan but grew up in america
2314752 this incredible progress was made possible by a responsive and responsible virginia delegation and the great business sense of a local firm
2314753 ah it didnt go through until very late last night try again in the morning
2314754 you need to go back to the store and then verify your chip and pin
2314755 what were going to do to trigger it again is ask you to go back to the store and well do a refund and resale sorry about the inconvenience but theres nothing we can do
2314756 so youve been studying hard and youre starting to amass an incredible amount of data supporting drug policy reform youre ready to make a difference
2314757 at a time when pundits and politicians of all stripes endorse securing the border between the united states and mexico
2314758 its like saying once you get into willy wonkas chocolate factory and youre in the garden where everythings edible you have it all
2314759 the technology is becoming easier and cheaper and anybody can do it and at the same time theres more incentive now to do it these are two trains on a collision course the question is when theyre going to collide
2314760 at a time when the u s financial markets are taking a beating and the economy is creating difficult times for our nations top companies its encouraging to see that more women lawyers are serving as the chief legal officer to whom ceos turn to lead the company through todays legal and regulatory challenges
2314761 the most challenging and for me the most exciting aspect of the position is in trying to be proactive in the worldwide environment in which we operate when a company has an international footprint like ours it requires a familiarity not only with foreign laws but also with geopolitical issues the business is more complex and the scale is larger than what ive experienced before
2314762 talk a little louder and more frequently and make sure people understand when youre the one making the decision
2314763 first i was into money then gambling followed by drugs and now my parents are delighted that im going into an industry with tasty baked goods
2314764 ive truly worked in many industries and there are a lot of parallels among the companies where ive worked now im able to use that experience at sara lee

2314767 i am not sure why kelsey was even named in this suit
2314768 he was an actor who signed on to the project after the script was written
2314769 essentially except for the character names and the relationship developed between the main characters played by defendant kevin costner and his daughter the entire concept of swing vote was taken from the copyrighted work
2314770 the potential is there and it is ultimately up to the iraqi people to make sound choices that will allow them to build a sustainable and lasting peace
2314771 sensational lethal attacks and their use of person borne improvised explosive devices
2314772 time is of the essence and iraq can no longer afford continued delays in finding viable political solutions long term stability will require significant political buy in from all segments of the population many of which are not yet fully engaged in the political process
2314773 sensational lethal attacks and their use of person borne improvised explosive devices

2314946 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow
2314947 but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
2314948 it is of deep concern that the technology underpinning a key part of the uks security can be compromised so easily
2314949 no one has yet been able to demonstrate that they are able to modify change or alter data within the chip if any data were to be changed modified or altered it would be immediately obvious to the electronic reader

2314959 the next best step for the phillip pullman harry potter set
2314960 jeffrey skillfully infuses the story with authentic historical context and then thrusts this narrative into the future by introducing aliens time travel and massive gems with the power to stop time and minds a difficult task indeed but one that he successfully accomplishes
2314961 driven and driven well by good old fashioned sci fi storytelling
2314962 it doesnt take long before the characters drag you hurtling into an inextricable web of metaphyics time travel paranormal powers and sumerian mythos
2314963 few people have jammed as much imagination in a 212 page book as mark jeffrey has in the pocket and the pendant
2314964 even adults will be fascinated by the theories in this tale author mark jeffrey has done a masterful job of blending facts and theories together smoothly for an amazing story that readers will find utterly delightful very well done indeed
2314965 as good as i thought the first book was this book is even better many authors have that quality first book then in their follow on the quality declines as they grasp for plots to extend the story or start blathering on about their personal preferences for love life food choices political beliefs and all other what not mark doesnt instead this story puts its foot on the throttle in chapter one then brings you on a careening edge of the seat ride right till the very en d a brilliant job of giving you enough information to guess where you may be going and then providing surprises that take you to places you never thought youd go great answers to questions from book one and by the end youll have plenty of new questions that will leave you waiting for book three
2314966 mark jeffreys characters have evolved enormously in the second and long anticipated novel of the max quick series the story gets deeper and deeper with every chapter making it an amazing sequel to the first book the pocket and the pendant quite honestly this book has put mark jeffrey near the top of my favorite authors of all time along with stephenie meyer chris paolini and the amazing jo rowling
2314967 just finished this after re reading the pocket and the pendant wow this book swallows the first book whole the leaps from pocket to travelers is like the leap from the the hobbit to fellowship of the ring it has the same characters but a much bigger and expanded world and stakes the writing is much better in this book as well mr jeffrey has learned a lot since his first outing he managed to touch on every theme and idea i have an interest in once again a very philosophical boo k awesome book two thumbs up
2314968 mind boggling creativity the invented mythology that fuels the plot of this book a blend of sumerian egyptian greek roman and many others that im sure i missed was absolute genius upon reaching the portion of the book where the backstory was told think of frodo arriving at rivendell and everyone sharing their stories particularly gandalf i became hooked
2314969 a powerful thrilling read that brings you back and forth through scientific theory childhood and the meaning of the universe
2314970 ive read a good deal of fiction books in my time but nothing quite like this one the mixing of ideas from all genres was just brilliantly done
2314971 jeffrey manages to throw down novel idea after novel idea
2314972 mark jeffreys book the first in a planned series has enough twists and turns to keep you flipping the pages and enough satisfying surprises to elicit a sigh of satisfaction at the end
2314973 young mr quick may give a certain spectacled boy with a lightning scar on his forehead a run for his money

2314993 they have nothing there was not a single piece of evidence produced from all those search warrants and all those affidavits he was a weird bookish nerdy kind of man he was an open caring honest man with a great sense of humor who was beloved by his friends and family
2314994 you are so going down tonight at practice you are mine have a nice day

2314999 by extending our service offerings and subscription products we will bring greater value to the marketplace
2315000 we are pleased to be joining the preeminent player in our industry and know our online presence will broaden altus substantial information resources
2315001 we are elated to be part of this successful expanding canadian based company
2315002 our proud celebration of these funds three year anniversary is improved as we recognize their compelling performance and five star ratings from morningstar
2315003 both pwv and pwj are based on quantitative rules based intellidexes designed to maximize the potential for outperformance invesco powershares is committed to delivering value and market leading ideas to investors as we seek to enhance their portfolios with our pioneering family of etfs
2315004 employers have a duty to provide risk assessments under the health and safety at work act equipment and personal protective equipment must be assessed the fbu will not see fire fighters safety being compromised
2315005 since the fire service does not have a legal responsibility to provide equipment and resources for floods and water related rescue this cover seems to be being provided in a piecemeal manner as it is not funded by central government
2315006 but it is a tribute to our good industrial relations that in again highlighting to management their failings but being able to step up to the mark and to find the ways forward through our underpinning knowledge and expertise and the perusal of good industrial relations we were able to cause the minimum of disruption and therefore guarantee the safety of our crews and that of the public of the two counties
2315007 this expense of 518 000 is a mixed blessing it is the result of our stock price moving up 54 from 27 80 per share at the end of the first quarter to 42 75 per share at the end of the second quarter we are very happy for our shareholders that this increase took place however it does have the inverse effect of generating a non cash expense for the overall increase in the value of phantom shares owned by our board members
2315008 leaders are performing well today have a clear vision of market direction and are actively building competencies to sustain their leadership position in the market service providers in this quadrant have a strong worldwide presence provide a broad range of services invest in innovative service tools and technologies and articulate a clear vision of current and future customer requirements and storage service solutions
2315009 ibms unique approach to storage and data services is founded on a client view of the problems they are trying to solve therefore we integrate across our company with ibm research and development the many recent ibm acquisitions like xiv diligent and cognos and with our robust partner network to provide end to end client solutions
2315010 in my opinion this honor from gartner shows that ibms evolving winning and well executed strategy is paying off and demonstrates our continued commitment to helping clients more efficiently store manage and understand and leverage data so they can align their it and business strategies to grow their respective businesses
2315011 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
2315012 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
2315013 we now have an inkling of just how deep in the mud mccain and his people are willing to wallow in order to win in november right up to their republican eyeballs
2315014 they put out this ad and were running this ad and were talking about it which from their point of view actually works for them
2315015 they work and they always work and we always go through this little dance when everybody says im a different kind of politician im post partisan im a maverick and of course when it comes right down to it you need to drive the other guys numbers down if anything they havent gone negative enough just yet
2315016 do you think the frivolous jeering tone of your campaign matches the problems being faced by this country and the sacrifices being made right now by our soldiers overseas
2315017 as many have noted the ad uses hyperbole still however it raises the question is michelle obama a woman
2315018 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
2315019 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
2315020 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
2315021 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
2315022 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
2315023 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
2315024 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
2315025 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
2315026 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
2315027 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
2315028 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition

2315046 our three new board members have extensive global experience in the resource and financial sectors we are pleased that individuals of this caliber have agreed to join the board and we look forward to drawing upon their valuable knowledge and experience as we take the company forward
2315047 we were particularly interested in an enterprise wide solution that could give seamless visibility to customers transactions and product to all of our stores integration with our key internal systems and an open next generation technology platform was also critical as we position our strauss discount auto chain for continued growth in the united states
2315048 after a careful evaluation of software vendors we chose srs in part because of their close relationship with ibm a long time strategic partner for autobacs strauss the solution suite uses state of the art technologies on top of ibms industry leading application platform websphere commerce
2315049 we continue to build for the future raising almost 400 million in capital which we have invested in new and expanded calloway quality shopping centres
2315050 with a portfolio of 134 primarily wal mart anchored retail properties containing almost 22 million square feet of leaseable area we are well positioned

2315052 api shanghais aog support services are just one example of apis dedication to customer support and satisfaction
2315053 every api employee operates under the mantra that customer satisfaction is our only job security whether working from our u s headquarters one of our canadian locations or part of our team servicing europe the middle east or africa our api asia pacific and api shanghai employees stand by ready to provide immediate response and the highest quality to all aviation customers in the region

2315060 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses and illicit trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media by 2015 we will need integrated and collaborative capabilities that can anticipate and rapidly respond to a wide array of threats and risks
2315061 our analytic professionals will collaborate with world class experts in academe commercial interests and think tanks all with similar knowledge and personal networks deep expertise will require broad access to open source information our unique collection results and a network of outside experts our understanding of the breadth and depth of policy intelligence doctrine and global situational awareness must match the depth of our analyses
2315062 by 2015 the intelligence community will be expected to provide more details about more issues to more customers
2315063 to carry out its mission in an increasingly turbulent and complex global environment the intelligence enterprise must enhance capabilities to evaluate global risks affecting our national security
2315064 the opportunity now exists to tap into a vastly larger amount of expertise than was previously available to intelligence
2315065 i am personally grateful for the expertise and leadership chris bailey has provided vangent over the past five years i wish chris and her family well during this difficult time

2315068 mobile advertising is rapidly emerging as a key enabler for consumer adoption of the mobile internet and media and amobee is leading that charge
2315069 we see tremendous growth for new compelling applications and services across consumer segments and product lines in particular when we can provide flexible business models and options for our carrier partners and consumers similar to those currently experienced on the web
2315070 research has shown that the user paid model is one of the key barriers to the growth of mobile data consumption and revenues
2315071 as the mobile phone is fast becoming a media channel amobees ad funded model works to bridge the gap between device manufacturers operators and advertisers creating value for all stakeholders through increased data consumption and greater revenues
2315072 we believe our new strategy is sound and while any new strategy takes time to gain traction it will ultimately prove itself in the marketplace
2315073 we have improved our relationship with henry schein reorganized our domestic sales team and processes and have a new emphasis on market segmentation and corresponding product development programs many of those programs are underway and the organization is responding well cost controls continue to be strong and while we still anticipate somewhat uneven revenue growth in the near term the team has made a great deal of progress toward our goals
2315074 while overall sales grew 3 percent year over year in the second quarter waterlase sales experienced a 7 percent decline due to weaker international performance the summer months traditionally make the third quarter a more challenging one so this is an ideal time for launching our new two tiered product strategy there may be some transitional impact of these changes in the third quarter but we are confident in the long term benefits of our strategy
2315075 my name is charlie williams and im the best tenor soloist in holland
2315076 our ability to join hands with exceptional research publishers such as aveus allows us to not only broaden the scope of research available in the field of customer experience it also allows business professionals throughout the world easier access to reports of great value that they may have previously been unaware of
2315077 teaming up with marketresearch com is an exceptional opportunity for us as our product line is an excellent fit for this resource avenue
2315078 we believe that the increased exposure our products will receive through marketresearch coms web traffic and sales force will have a positive impact on our business as our reports make it into the hands of a wider global audience
2315079 there are a myriad of benefits to sitestar from this acquisition
2315080 including new revenue from the velocity west retail sales and its strong wholesale dial up business plus the programs they have developed can save us significant operating costs and increase our margins we look forward to quickly implementing and integrating these assets

2315088 we are pleased with the results of the election and the boards commitment to the vineyard franchise we believe that this board has the vision the energies and the resources to accomplish what i have long recommended to the company
2315089 i know that this board understands the urgency of the companys current circumstances and has the experience and capacity to promptly take the corrective actions that are needed i would like to thank the shareholders who have overwhelmingly stated their support
2315090 one of the primary tasks of the new board is to immediately implement the capital plan that has been developed for the company if successful our efforts to raise and inject significant amounts of new regulatory capital will provide the company with the liquidity and capital to maintain flexibility for its operations by restoring the companys capital to the levels desired by the new board the company will regain the ability to respond to market opportunities while it takes all necessary steps to strengthen its balance sheet in this challenging economic environment we will continue to work with the previously identified financial advisors which include friedman billings ramsey amp co inc howe barnes hoefer arnett inc and sandler oneill to accomplish this important task
2315091 we know management has been diligent in identifying and addressing weaknesses in its loan portfolio and that appropriate steps are being taken the new board will continue to support vineyards efforts to accelerate the completion of this important process through the resources provided by the company following implementation of the capital plan the ability of the company to execute its proposed capital plans will depend on a number of factors including market conditions at the time returning the company to stable and consistent operations is paramount i am confident that the new board has the tools resources and desire to accomplish this important endeavor the board will continue to be focused on the execution of the companys strategic initiatives in a very challenging economic market place while rebuilding shareholder value and confidence
2315092 i look forward to working with the newly constituted board to accomplish these objectives while continuing to meet our customers needs in the communities that we serve

2315098 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices and i had hoped that it would never become public
2315099 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2315102 is not being phased out diego has long been a part of this radio station and woven into brand of what is q102 now and his involvement in the community we absolutely want to continue that
2315103 i think its because he does it in a non glamorous fashion he doesnt blow guys away or shatter bats or get a lot of strikeouts but hes the type of guy who can frustrate an opponent because you look up in the sixth inning and youre being shut out
2315104 when you have a sinker it doesnt matter if the opposing team is looking for it
2315105 when he has his sinker he can go six shutout innings like tonight

2315128 we completed fiscal 2008 with a 44 improvement in new product introductions as measured by engineering content this marks two consecutive years of improvement and should serve as the catalyst for future growth the increase in our engineering productivity the effectiveness of our recent focus on margins and the successful realignment of our business units give maxim management confidence that we will grow revenue and earnings when the macro economic environment improves additionally further reduction in capital expenditures during fiscal 2009 should increase our free cash flow in light of this i am pleased to announce that maxims board of directors has approved a 6 7 increase in our quarterly dividend from 0 1875 per share to 0 20 per share

2315150 when zucker heard rosie odonnell claim that radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam in a country like america where we have a separation of church and state he knew he had several minutes of material snip in the film a rotund comedian named rosie oconnell makes an appearance on the oreilly factor to promote her documentary the truth about radical christians oreilly shows a clip which opens with a pair of priests walking through an airport as seen from pre hijacking surveillance video before boarding the airplane once onboard they storm the cockpit using crucifixes as their weapon of choice
2315151 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state

2315167 we used to be three dudes going down the street with a washtub a little raggedy guitar and another cat with maracas
2315168 in the first half of 2008 we delivered on the promises of our r amp d programs announcing milestone achievements in all three of our bone and joint alliances with big pharma and advancing the pre clinical development of our rheumatoid arthritis and bone metastasis programs
2315169 this progress puts us in a prime position to have these programs in the clinic early next year in addition based on the data analysis from the nanocort clinical trial we have decided to move forward and start a large phase ii study for flares in rheumatoid arthritis in 2009 our pharma partnering strategy allows us to largely offset our increased r amp d investments with milestones as a result we see no need to seek further funding in 2008 and 2009
2315170 the galapagos group delivered a solid first half in 2008 by growing revenues and improving our cost base while delivering on our strategic objectives the recovery of biofocus dpi is well on track to full year profitability with a strong pipeline and margin improvement in new contracts

2315181 comenc jugando con gast n malacalza hemos tenido muchos altibajos llegamos incluso a la final en logro o pero cuando perdimos la qu mica fue el momento de separarnos fue all cuando se me present la oportunidad de volver con ra l para reeditar viejas pocas y en ese camino estamos
2315182 con los cambios no siempre se pueden obtener buenos resultados a la primera pero tuvimos buenas sensaciones en madrid donde perdimos un partido que ten amos ganado frente a nicoletti d az porque hab amos ganado el primer set e bamos 3 1 en el segundo
2315183 llegamos muy bien esta ma ana ganamos por un doble 6 3 y el de esta tarde ser un partido diferente

2315186 my primary wish regarding this film is that after watching it people would start paying attention to the things that really matter like football and shopping
2315187 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
2315188 was a horrible horrible decision that we still dwell on
2315189 were not in the business of doing things because wed like to if we cant guarantee that it makes sense for the company
2315190 youth needs the energy of youth which is why their learning need to be fresh and subsumed with real life as opposed to the standard practice of stale words and long spoilt ideas what is needed is not necessarily new materials but perhaps a fresh new viewpoint from which to reinvent the familiar
2315191 our performance has been very positive in the face of a deteriorating market
2315192 while we were not surprised by the negative turn in the market the erosion was much more significant than anyone envisioned earlier in the year it is evident that the market turmoil is not restricted to housing or commercial construction but has spilled over into the larger economy in light of the weakening credit conditions and the lack of confidence in the financial sector in spite of these headwinds and the slower pace of acquisitions in the first half of the year our core operating strengths strong sales focus and cost containment practices continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders the best evidence of this is found in our strong gross margin performance
2315193 commercial construction and non aec accounts continue to provide a solid base of business in spite of the general economic softness and we continue to acquire market share through selective acquisitions and an aggressive sales stance
2315194 by managing our costs and working capital closely the company continues to generate strong cash flow from operations our year to date cash from operating activities is 61 5 million compared to 45 4 million for the same period in 2007
2315195 earlier this year when we provided our sales and earnings guidance our projection of revenue deterioration was primarily related to residential construction since then the financial markets have weakened significantly causing a slowdown in private investment a key driver of non residential construction this slowdown combined with uncertain economic conditions is triggering project delays and cancellations in spite of these adversities we still believe the companys sales and earnings will be within the original annual range we projected due to our position in the market place and our operating strength
2315196 thus we are reaffirming our guidance for 2008 and expect revenues to be in the range of 720 million to 760 million and that earnings per share will be in the range of 1 52 to 1 60 on a fully diluted basis
2315197 the combination of resource scheduler and york telecoms managed collaboration services will allow clients to proactively manage and schedule all of their meeting technology resources such as audio and video conferencing meeting support and portable av technology
2315198 given the rising social and economic pressures to go green energy conservation is no longer a choice for organizations but rather a mandate
2315199 because the cost of energy continues to rise managing energy consumption to reduce costs is a necessity
2315200 our overall strategy continues to be to strengthen our position in the affinity based segment of the subscription driven dating market
2315201 over the past five quarters weve been focused on increasing stockholder value and return by growing our other affinity networks segment maximizing the yield from our jewish networks optimizing our marketing spend adding an advertising revenue stream reducing overhead and prudently allocating capital
2315202 this strategy has translated into increased profitability and cash flow in the second quarter adjusted ebitda 1 excluding currency translation adjustments was 4 4 million or a 29 margin cash flow was 4 2 million a 19 increase over the same period last year and a 43 sequential increase
2315203 we made tremendous progress in the business during the quarter beyond what is reflected in this quarters financial results in fact we enter the second half of the year with strong business momentum led by the closure of several service contracts and the expected closure of several others one of which could evolve into the largest non microsoft contract in the companys history although this quarters revenue fell below our expectations we currently expect that third quarter revenue will increase approximately 30 year over year and roughly 15 sequentially
2315204 software sales both proprietary and third party fell below our expectations this quarter
2315205 sdio royalties from key customers were weaker than expected due to lower device shipments which negatively affected proprietary software revenue we have won several new sdio design wins over the last few quarters and we expect royalties to increase as customer shipment volumes increase sales of our ti omap development kits also fell below expectations as the market is taking longer to ramp than we expected however there is strong interest in omap technology from customers and we are bullish that omap software and related service revenue will increase in coming quarters we will continue our efforts to build new proprietary software revenue streams through new product investments and new royalty bearing service contracts softness in third party software this quarter was driven by delays in orders from several large customers we expect that these customers will resume their normal ordering patterns in q3
2315206 while service revenue came in lower than anticipated this quarter due to softness in asia we enter q3 with a record backlog and our pipeline has never been stronger
2315207 several recent and expected wins in both north america and asia are expected to increase our service revenue for the rest of the year and into 2009 more than offsetting the minor softness we experienced in q2 im happy to say that the summer slowdown that has affected north america service revenue the last two years is not expected to reoccur this year
2315208 we had expected this quarters service margin to improve more than it did year over year while that did not occur due to the revenue recognition delays and other factors which affected this quarter we still expect our service margin to improve into the mid thirty percent range for fiscal 2008 as compared to 29 in fiscal 2007 depending on the effect of new potentially significant contracts over the next two quarters

2315222 again this quarter we are pleased to report very strong same store growth we are encouraged by our progress in growing occupancy in our portfolio as evidenced by our increases in same store physical occupancy over the second quarter of last year our top line growth continues to be driven not only by occupancy but by solid increases in our in place rents as we focus daily on controlling discounts and selectively pushing rates
2315223 our results are in line with our guidance and expectations our ffo was 0 25 per share the mid point of our guidance had we not written off certain third party due diligence costs during the quarter we continue to make solid progress on our asset disposition program and in our marketing of a potential joint venture as expected our same store operating expense growth reflects the investment of marketing dollars at the beginning of the rental season in order to generate the greatest return and we are pleased with the result we are affirming our previously issued 2008 full year ffo per share and same store noi guidance

2315237 these joint patrols allow us to work better together and reduce overfishing not only in nafo but in other areas as well
2315238 this type of collaboration keeps the door open for joint efforts in the future
2315239 by working together we can send a clear message illegal fishing activity will not be tolerated and we are determined in our fight to end it

2315248 this is not a government that can simply run for re election on its record absent of fresh ideas like the chretien liberals did in 97 and 2000 it has no signature accomplishment akin to slaying the deficit to hang its hat on not when its accountability agenda has been undermined by 1 potential campaign spending improprieties 2 maxime berniers foibles the 3 chuck cadman allegations and various other controversies it cant bank on a thriving economy to engender goodwill
2315249 the liberals have long benefited from the support of the countrys most powerful vested interests and the ndp has always been backed by the countrys loudest vocal interests

2315265 have a real short memory on how corrupt past liberal governments really were and how much they will lie to get into power
2315266 so sine the liberal party selected stephane dion to protect the canadian nation from harper and the americans
2315267 why is dions personal popularity around 15 in poll after poll while harper is preferred by about 40 of canadians
2315268 perhaps dion should unite the hate filled left by merging the liberals and ndp so that canadians can fully express their hatred of americans and protect the true 65 socialistic canada
2315269 perhaps the conservatives were correct about dion not a leader
2315270 the sacrifices and achievements of our service men and women in the first world war helped to define canada as a nation and shape the country in which we live today
2315271 we will never forget the great debt we owe them

2315283 firstgold welcomes the confidence that the investment group that funded the loan has demonstrated in our ongoing development at relief canyon with this investment we had always planned to add some debt in our capital structure in the development of our relief canyon processing facilities the challenges of the debt market today produced a higher cost than we had planned but does provide us with funding necessary to get relief canyon operational from this point forward 100 of our efforts will be spent on getting relief canyon online and in proving up a resource at relief canyon and our other nevada properties
2315284 our stock has suffered due to the fear that perhaps we would not obtain the financing we needed to get relief canyon operational with this investment we hope to put those fears to rest while we recognize this was an expensive financing issuing equity at our current levels would have been much more costly now that we have this capital in place we plan to communicate the progress we have made to our shareholders and the investment community at some point in the near term as investors become aware of our prospects and convinced of our progress we would expect our stock to find its true value

2315298 quest is firmly on track with the growth strategy we introduced for 2008
2315299 we are experiencing a significant increase in new lending opportunities from quality borrowers and are meeting this demand as a dedicated mortgage investment corporation or mic
2315300 quests results to date are satisfying and include growth in interest income a sizeable increase in our loan portfolio based on good funding volumes a reduction in impaired loans and the payment of an attractive dividend
2315301 our ability to reduce taxable income through the payment of dividends to shareholders has helped us to increase shareholder yield and after tax earnings net income for the second quarter of 2008 is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2006 during the quarter we also took the first steps towards applying for a deposit taking license this is a major initiative that if successful will accelerate our growth potential in future years
2315302 with estimated underlying security of 20 million on our impaired loans we expect to avoid losses and maintain our track record of credit quality
2315303 moreover because we are targeting to achieve an increasing level of geographic diversification within our portfolio we have confidence that we can continue to achieve one of our main objectives preservation of capital
2315304 from a capital perspective we have drawn down 66 5 million of our 88 0 million revolving debt facility at june 30 2008 so while weve been very efficient in using leverage we still have room to support the addition of quality mortgages including the use of syndication from a market perspective while were cognizant of the fact that canadian real estate markets are not as strong as last year they still provide more than adequate support for quest were particularly pleased with the reception weve been given in the selected locations in the ontario market since opening there earlier this year and expect our mortgage portfolio there to grow in the second half this complements our additional penetration into the saskatchewan market in terms of adding value to shareholders we remain optimistic

2315307 do you mean that writing a sonnet or haiku is easier than writing free verse personally i think that being confined to a form creates the greater challenge
2315308 although our financial results remain unacceptable we did see a significant improvement in our operating performance in the quarter our efforts to offset cost pressures with synergies combined with our announced price increases should provide a significant improvement in both our operating efficiency and financial performance through the balance of this year
2315309 recognizing continued market and economic challenges abitibibowater is ready to take all actions it believes necessary including the elimination of unprofitable production also as our phase 2 review of operations continues an important consideration will be the renewal on acceptable terms of the cep labor agreements of our canadian operations in 2009

2315318 pressure on householders income together with a very significant reduction in mortgage finance due to the global financial markets crisis is constraining potential house buyers ability to enter the market
2315319 this is resulting in both lower prices and activity levels
2315320 we are delighted that mortgage next has been selected as one of kensingtons packager panel going forward we believe that our commitment to working closely with lenders such as kensington have helped us in successfully retaining our place on the reduced panel in todays market we still have a wide panel of lenders and are therefore able to offer a wide choice to brokers seeking a solution for their clients rather than being able to offer access to just a few
2315321 membership of kensingtons packager panel is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure we are able to continue to provide the highest level of service to our key partners we look forward to working together with all of our business relationships as we work through this difficult trading environment and benefit from market recovery

2315463 this is the behaviour of a brutal dictatorship not a political party working in the interests of its people
2315464 it is beyond doubt that there are now two separate palestinian territories so who does israel deal with mahmoud abbas does not speak for palestinians in gaza and hamas is not interested in any negotiations with israel at all this civil war makes a permanent solution impossible to negotiate

2315553 an estimated one million persons in the united states are living with hiv aids with approximately one fourth of these cases attributable to injection drug use
2315554 this paper provides important evidence for the value of routinely providing haart therapy to hiv infected injection drug users who need treatment benefiting both the patients and the public at large
2315555 hopefully the findings from this study help address the commonly held assumption that hiv positive injection drug users do not derive the full benefits of hiv treatment
2315556 we have an ethical and human rights imperative to deliver hiv care to this population not only to reduce illness and death but also to possibly reduce the rate of new infections in the community

2315577 drives for wind power will be up by 20 limited only by capacity
2315578 is approximately 23 of revenue growing at 10 per annum and expected to be 25 of revenue by fy2011

2315591 the complexities of our global business necessitate that we closely manage our budgeting and reporting processes
2315592 one of our major goals was to do segment planning for our power supply product families we needed to make sure that our planning was in line with the ever changing gaap fasb and sec requirements and that it supported our existing management reporting processes we realized that we required one integrated system rather than a host of standalone tools and selected adaptive planning because they could deliver powerful capabilities in a quick to implement easy to use solution that required minimal involvement from it
2315593 it was a true celebration of our love and was everything that we had dreamed of since we decided to get married
2315594 matt was desperate to get married and it was such a relief to get through the day and become his wife but obviously we would have wanted more time together
2315595 he appeared to be in the best health he had been in for a long time
2315596 he looked fantastic dressed up to the nines in his top hat and tails
2315597 he was an outstanding all round student who was involved in many aspects of the college
2315598 matt was the kind of person who put his heart and soul into everything they did he was a fantastic man and i will miss him very much
2315599 he was a bright and enthusiastic student passionate about the study of history and also a popular and talented all rounder
2315600 based on advice of counsel we believe that the nhpucs order contains a number of significant legal errors that undermine its validity accordingly we expect to seek a rehearing before the nhpuc thereafter if necessary we will consider an appeal to the new hampshire supreme court which must be filed within 30 days of a ruling by the nhpuc on the rehearing the full rehearing and appeal process could take a year or more if the citys right to take the utility assets is ultimately upheld its aldermanic board would then still have to decide whether or not to proceed with the taking assuming it is able to finance the purchase
2315601 we ensure the integrity of clinical trials by selecting investigators experienced in conducting industry sponsored gcp compliant clinical trials

2315605 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2315606 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2315607 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2315608 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2315609 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence

2315612 this volume is edited by her son in law terence dooley and though she would have welcomed this act of filial piety she might have regretted some of its execution
2315613 the notes are decidedly skimpy some serious work on the apparatus before the paperback would be very welcome she deserves as no one doubts the rolls royce treatment
2315614 this is a fabulous book that drags vermeer away from our complacent eurocentric assumptions of his insular domesticity
2315615 the writing is effortless but compelling and timothy brook is a wonderful storyteller i doubt i will read a better book this year
2315616 just as many of the trails he follows are characterised by accidental occurrences that cause journeys to change course one of the reasons he begins in delft is because he fell off his bike there that accident has resulted in a highly successful experiment in historical storytelling which is clear original thoughtful and engaging brook should definitely go cycling more often
2315617 in her new novel bernardine evaristo has taken her boldest step to date
2315618 she imagines it was africans who enslaved europeans running through these pages is not just a feisty hyperactive imagination asking what if but an unhealed african heart with the question how does it feel this is a powerful gesture of fearless thematic ownership by one of the uks most unusual and challenging writers
2315619 the inversion of african and european roles is literally skin deep

2315628 a portion of the costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices
2315629 canadians can expect to bear real costs for the majority of individual canadians and for businesses outside of the regulated sectors these costs will be most evident in the form of higher energy prices particularly with respect to electricity and natural gas

2315631 some industrial sectors particularly those that are more carbon intensive will be more affected than others in the short and medium term costs for these industries are primarily driven by the requirement for accelerated investments in more energy efficient less carbon intensive capital and technologies with some loss in output possible

2315645 ive a confession after a great deal of research on climate change the economy current oil prices energy costs and family finances i have come to a conclusion regarding putting a price on carbon inherently its unfair
2315646 can you support this a price imposed on every ton of carbon emitted these business taxes inevitably passed on to consumers higher energy costs especially for electricity and natural gas families forced to conserve and yet still spend more rural canadians disadvantaged lower economic activity across canada higher corporate costs a drop in business output productivity and jobs i cant the risk is too great

2315672 we believe consumers deserve to know what they can expect from a prepaid phone card no matter what destination they are calling or company it was purchased from
2315673 viscom has always dealt with its customers transparently and is now leading the way in outlining exactly what consumers should demand from their prepaid phone cards
2315674 our company was built on building a rock solid transparent brand that provides all minutes promised to consumers its a business model that works and we believe other prepaid providers can and should deal fairly with consumers
2315675 certain kinds of important stories that simply cannot be covered except by deep pocketed traditional media organizations employing professional journalists
2315676 readers were able to observe the piteous wreckage behind the trolls braggadocio
2315677 who could throw all of these resources behind a single investigation
2315678 for investigative blockbusters like the trolls among us you have to go to dinosaur media such as the new york times the atlantic monthly or the new yorker
2315679 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
2315680 we are pleased that we have been able to extend our relationship with adobe and to continue adobe postscript licensing and support capabilities to our valued customers in the digital imaging marketplace
2315681 for the next several months the well publicized turmoil in the credit markets is expected to have a negative effect on the home sales that are channeled through our established retail network although we have been very successful in developing alternative channels of distribution for our modular products the companys revenue and earnings in the second half of 2008 will undoubtedly be negatively affected by the unusually slow sales rate at the retail sales centers on the other hand the reduction of capacity by competitors in our market area and the passage of the new federal housing relief bill may result in an offsetting positive effect with its strong modular backlog the company anticipates continued profitable operations throughout the last six months of 2008 however continuation of the record pace set in the first half of the year is certainly not assured
2315682 he is not the hero we deserve but the hero we needed
2315683 unfortunately there were some statements that i made at the conference that were not accurate
2315684 heb llc does not own any other assets outside of the health care space and has no interest in gaming whatsoever i also stated that debbie jenkins was president when in fact it is cathy bradshaw i also stated that the firm had outside backing from gaming revenues when in fact it is not from investment directly into wound management technologies
2315685 at future conferences i will insure that only the principals speak on behalf of the company i had a very late flight the time difference to contend with other clients information that i was also presenting and i was not as fully prepared as i should have been i hope that this has not affected any perception of the achievements of the company now or in the future
2315686 the monarch is the one embodiment of the state which is outside the political partisan process
2315687 the people behind this campaign must either oppose the idea of anyone who is non partisan having a role in the affairs of state or they would rather be swearing allegiance to brussels
2315688 recognises that some honourable members would prefer to swear an oath of allegiance to their constituents and the nation rather than the monarch
2315689 bring forward legislative proposals to introduce an optional alternative parliamentary oath
2315690 swear allegiance to their constituents and the nation and to pledge to uphold the law
2315691 we were taken in a van with blacked out windows we were shown how to use the gun we all shot the gun
2315692 its like the wild west out there everybody has a gun
2315693 at a time when every right thinking politician is concerned about levels of violence and gun crime this man is training his children in how to use a deadly assault rifle
2315694 why was he doing this this sends out the worst possible message and renders cllr hanif unsuitable to hold elected public office mr salmond needs to take decisive action or his own credibility will be under question
2315695 cllr hanif has not had the opportunity to put his side of the story
2315696 on the face of it he has not broken the law and there is no suggestion of any involvement in anything untoward
2315697 nevertheless this was foolish and inappropriate conduct cllr hanif has been suspended from the party and therefore the council group pending a disciplinary hearing where he will have the opportunity to explain himself and this incident
2315698 i regret that this happened and apologise it was foolish and inappropriate
2315699 it took place over two and a half years ago long before i became a councillor
2315700 i accept the actions of the party and will wish to take part in the formal hearing on my return to scotland
2315701 it seems to me that dsm having given free expert advice by telephone then attended the home of the defender and i consider that if a member of the public asked a tradesman to attend they could expect to pay a call out charge
2315702 what i would say to people is that they must make absolutely sure preferably in writing about what payments will be demanded of them before allowing any tradesman through their door
2315703 if you do not specifically ask about a call out charge this court case today proves that you will be liable to pay one
2315704 i would also say that you should be very careful about what tradesmen say in adverts
2315705 this is a superb day for us and its a victory for small businesses and the working man
2315706 we had a better quarter when compared to the same period last year with sales up 3 5 and earnings before items increasing 23 million despite a 5 9 drop in paper shipments clearly the synergies are starting to show in our results and the projected benefits from new initiatives have led us to increase our synergy target to 250 million
2315707 having said that the announced price increases for papers in june are necessary to adjust to this new business environment of structurally higher input costs
2315708 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
2315709 the system is supposed to catch and report that sort of information

2315723 this was a case of a fair minded panel of military officers operating in a fundamentally unfair system
2315724 the fact that the military officers performed their duties conscientiously does not make fair a system which allows the use of coerced evidence is designed to cover up abuse and disregards basic due process protections
2315725 the distribution of wealth is skewed and levels of inequality are now higher than at any time since the gilded age

2315738 there was the draft in vietnam so everybody had a cousin a brother a husband somebody they knew in that war
2315739 but a lot of people dont know soldiers and marines in this war
2315740 the silence that was the understood way we dealt with it
2315741 it just wasnt discussed i think a lot of military kids would agree theyd know exactly what im talking about whether your dad was in world war ii or korea or vietnam if you brought it up and asked a question youd get a yes no and that was it

2315772 i want to say that i was the one that was responsible for all this controversy it wasnt their fault because it was me that said publicly that i wanted to move to real madrid it was also me although wholly unintentionally that caused the friction between the two clubs i knew that real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very substantial offer to manchester united for a while i wanted manchester to accept the offer and for me to move to madrid if i denied it i would be deceiving everyone including myself

2315789 the findings of burgomaster et al 2005 challenge the concept that aerobic endurance performance is only enhanced by aerobic endurance training on the surface this concept seems logical but it has been long ago proven wrong both in the realm of athletics as well as muscle biochemistry
2315790 bankers see tremendous value in having all of their credit polices and operating rules housed within a central location rather than in individual silos at each business line it ensures consistency of interpretation and compliance with the intent of the laws that the regulators promulgate not knowing the rules of the game or not following them precisely because of haste or misunderstanding is one of the prime causes of the deterioration weve seen in banks portfolios
2315791 but having a centralized repository with rules developed directly from the wording of the act means that all of them will be complying with the letter and the intent of the law during each transaction haleys determinations engine refers precisely to the relevant section of the policy document if there is a flaw the policy document mimics the law itself so there is no room for variance
2315792 i have never seen the environment as tight as it is now with the credit crisis regulators at both the federal and state levels are taking an aggressive stance to ensure that banks are complying with regulations and the regulations themselves have become more complicated and varied state by state
2315793 we are very happy that matt has joined the haley team he knows the banking business well and has worked with many top institutions to address pressing concerns through the use of technology financial services is already a sweet spot for our company and we see tremendous opportunity to expand market share by helping banks respond to the credit crunch through making well documented high quality loans

2315795 the challenge for us was to take two buildings that were built totally independent of one another with not a single floor of one building even remotely aligning with the floor in the next building and knit them together essentially making them function as one
2315796 they needed to share mechanical systems elevator and stairs to make it a viable project
2315797 for example you could go up to the fourth floor of the 1006 building or you could go up another five feet to the fourth floor of the 1004 building and doors on the other side of the cab will open
2315798 although theyre quite visibly two separate buildings they function inside as one
2315799 we were faced with a splotchy mottled looking fa ade on the one building with remnants of the white paint and the natural color underneath
2315800 a lot of people knew the building from the music row period
2315801 theres not a whole lot of downtown space that can be subdivided into such small areas

2315817 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2315818 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2315819 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz

2315838 legal aid has actually been representing grandparents in a number of different areas we assist with guardianships and adoptions as well as powers of attorney when the parents know that theyre going to giving their kids to the grandparents
2315839 while hanai is really one of the things that are popular in hawaii still people want that documentation to know legally that they have those grandparents
2315840 adoptions provide a little more stability and security for grandparents because they actually have full control and ability to raise those children as their own children when a grandparent takes an adoption they can actually apply for social security for that child
2315841 so they can apply for assistance from the department of human services for non needy caregivers or in some cases they can even go after those parents for child support
2315842 and i think some of the recent changes in the law will provide more opportunities for relatives to get more information about becoming foster parents it puts in new regulations for the department of human services to provide applications for these grandparents

2315845 were going to have a hearing before judge sakamoto and hes going to render a decision i would assume itll be done very quickly because in my 39 years as a lawyer this is one of the simplest issues ive ever had i mean its just what does the city charter mean
2315846 the court should grant us preliminary injunction because it would be irreparable harm to the plaintiffs not to put it on the ballot
2315847 you put it on the ballot and then if the city clerk prevails you dont count the votes
2315848 shall the powers duties and functions of the city through its director of transportation services include establishment of a steel wheel on steel rail transit system
2315849 whether its a petition or through the city council we need to put this question on the ballot and end this debate
2315850 our clerk is following the rules and asked the advice of legal counsel
2315851 its not a i dont believe political decision in any way
2315852 this is a decision made by the mayor not by the city clerk
2315853 im going to see my grandma who ive havent seen in almost 18 19 months and whos getting to the age where i want to make sure i spend time with her on a consistent basis and so she can see her great grandchildren
2315854 the excitement is incredible its actually continued over from last year
2315855 thats a long way to go but like i said which is why we created three packages one was get you there get you home another one was if youre going to go that far well hook you up with disneyworld for five nights and those who wanted to make some money back well take them to vegas make some money come home
2315856 we thought that when the game was announced as an afternoon game that the numbers would drop considerably but they continue to climb so that show you the passion of u h fans
2315857 we sold over 2 000 tickets out of our ticket block that we received from the university of florida so theres going to be a number of u h fans in attendance there which is fantastic this is the type of road following we havent seen before
2315858 after the perfect season last year and then into the sugar bowl we saw so many uptrends in so many different areas in terms of merchandise in terms of season ticket sales really across the board
2315859 its exciting its exciting to know that theres still hoard core u h fans and were going to whatever is possible to get them there

2315861 were trying to get the state to at least fund half the center as they have been doing or a quarter way whatever they can cause without a state contract we also lost eh building
2315862 i want the politicians to remember that they too are gonna be seniors sometime and have to have activities like this and the funding which they have cut off really gonna hurt
2315863 we have to eat hunger cant go on vacation you know
2315864 i was reading the newspaper and found out the olympics started on 8 8 08 i said hey theres a good day and its on a friday that nobodys getting married on a friday
2315865 when we first started calling venues they told us that people had booked from two years prior to us there was no way we were gonna find any place
2315866 well its actually a lot of fun when you got something like 8 to work with i mean theres all kinds of possibilities
2315867 one of them is that everybody at the wedding is going to be sitting at table 8 but every table is going to be in a different language
2315868 very concerned about the jeopardy of the junior varsity athletic programs
2315869 we want to be real careful that we dont touch the core whats happening in the classrooms and thats why all those things the outside peripherals we want to look at that first before we touch the classrooms
2315870 if we didnt have jv then some of the kids out here wouldnt be here and they wouldnt be doing that good in school because of football
2315871 if they are going to take away the jv its like they are taking away a stepping stone
2315872 drugs graffiti gangs you can list a whole bunch of things
2315873 who are we going to recruit because in my mind if you dont have a junior varsity you are not going to have a varsity in a couple of years
2315874 the purpose of todays action is to obtain a definitive ruling from the supreme court that the trustees racially exclusionary admissions policy violates our nations civil rights laws
2315875 the suit is based on a civil rights law that was enacted two years after the civil war where congress had to act on the climate and situation of newly freed slaves
2315876 we hope to get back what is rightfully kamehameha schools and that will be determined by the courts
2315877 much of the proceedings are confidential and thats part of agreements and agreements are that we write and sign we expect them to be upheld
2315878 as i pass through this years dog days in my felon ridden neighborhood ok just two housefuls but isnt that enough i am trying to focus on the blessings apparent around me past and present that i might not notice necessarily in that spirit this weeks friday five goes thusly
2315879 is that there will be a next time and it could be as soon as tomorrow

2315882 feedlots can hold 300 000 head of cattle outbreaks involving several hundred victims no longer shock us
2315883 the broader trend is for payers to pay for good performance and not pay for extremely poor performance which is a fundamental principle of good business practices before adam smith but its never been applied to health care
2315884 you dont have to pay for the airline ticket if the airplane crashes and there are other examples
2315885 we are talking about very dramatic events that should never occur
2315886 the majority of hospitals do not bill us for never events but given the complexity of billing billing systems and billing agencies some never events may slip through
2315887 with this new policy in place we can work to close the gaps and also focus on improving quality
2315888 we are committed that patients and payers not pay for care related to a never event that was within the hospitals control and preventable
2315889 there is no way to know whether that condition was there or whether it was under the hospitals control to begin with
2315890 you would have to test everybody before they arrived at the hospital

2315903 we have residents that have lived in atherton more than 40 years along the tracks
2315904 a lot of the concern is that the authoritys board wasnt given accurate information about the relative impacts of the two alignments
2315905 the staff of the high speed rail authority i dont know if id say they cooked the books but they tilted things very strongly to make it look like the peninsula alignment had a lot less impact than it does
2315906 when the cut is made the actual decisions as to what specifically will have to be eliminated if anything will be made at the school level
2315907 if the schools are forced to cut a million dollars from their collective budget than theres a strong possibility that jv sports would be cut
2315908 it would impact thousands of kids and several hundred if not a couple thousand teams
2315909 a lot of those kids the reason why theyre going to graduate this year is because they participated in jv football and jv athletics
2315910 a lot of them wouldnt be doing the right thing if they werent in athletics
2315911 the tough call comes when you have to cut what do you eliminate
2315912 woman what does your concern have to do with me my hour has not yet come
2315913 draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast
2315914 every man at the beginning sets out the good wine and when the guests have well drunk then the inferior you have kept the good wine until now
2315915 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2315916 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for
2315917 i skate around in skates and tights its not that big a deal
2315918 from the 40 000 i donated we raised over a million
2315919 i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
2315920 despite the complexities of the fighting thats going on between the rebels and the government there are 2 1 2 million men women and children who have been driven from their homes by a government that doesnt want them there the un needs to get peacekeepers into the area there should be 26 000 troops in there
2315921 athletes should have the right to say there are things in this world that are not right and we need to address them
2315922 one of them is darfur and china is the host country and its keeping those people from fulfilling their dreams theres potential olympians there
2315923 im not stunned that a non democratic government that doesnt endorse individual rights would be heavy handed
2315924 now we look at china it seems like theyre clamping down more and more and more in every single regard
2315925 everyones so desperate to do business in china that nobodys calling them on it
2315926 china has great economic ties with sudan so they back the sudanese
2315927 they dont really care what happens it seems like to the people in darfur
2315928 peace in darfur would be a much more huge accomplishment infinitely more satisfying
2315929 as soon as i put my skates on i thought this is what i want to do
2315930 when i was 15 i watched the 1994 lillehammer olympics and saw norways speedskater johann koss win three gold medals
2315931 youd have the worst insomnia because youd be worrying about am i going to be able to skate the same times i skated yesterday
2315932 i skated the best 1 000 meters ive ever skated and got the bronze
2315933 it is of course fantastic and a big relief but the biggest realization i had was basically that i had just pushed myself to manic depression and had been miserable and then when i did it i looked around and thought this is it the sun rises the same way and i still had to train seven hours a day
2315934 i realized you have a real shot to do something and not just win a medal and feel good about yourself
2315935 i decided next time not to do just a puppies and ice cream interview
2315936 so much of the news in the us is absolute garbage
2315937 its easy to say im not going to watch anything serious ill watch this garbage on britney spears
2315938 i dont blame the media as much as i blame ourselves if thats all you know it erodes a lot of what makes this country as great as it is
2315939 do i think its wrong that britney spears got 10 million more minutes of air time than 300 000 people in africa getting slaughtered yeah i think its bad but i try to focus on what i can do
2315940 as an american citizen if things get rough i can always pack up and go somewhere else
2315941 what infuriates me though is when you see people willfully supporting the dictator that enables this or giving the arms to one group of poor people so they can slaughter another slightly poorer group of poor people that infuriates me
2315942 olympic committees in the united kingdom belgium or new zealand countries that enjoy the same freedoms that we do tell you its not our place to be talking about this thats someone elses issue and no one else is solving it that infuriates me
2315943 it is great that mr cheeks voice is raising awareness especially at this time
2315944 the situation in darfur has cried out for international attention for years the suffering continues and still requires human intervention and protection for millions of civilians who are displaced
2315945 it is our hope that more athletes use the platform to shine the spotlight on human rights china needs to be pressed on their involvement in sudan
2315946 but not a lot of people are attacking the idea that these 2 million people need protection they may want me to go away but you cant assail the fact that these people need our help

2315949 since the beginning of exploration on our matoush project in 2006 we said and had repeated that our goal is to develop a minimum resource of between 15 and 20 millions pounds u3o8 to justify a mining operation of 2 million pounds per year for at least 10 years we are there now the matoush property is well on its way to becoming a world class uranium field with its very high grade extraordinary potential and localisation in quebec considered to be among the most favourable region in the world for mining development

2315971 borrowers that are especially vulnerable at the moment are ones with impaired credit histories or those with only small amounts of equity
2315972 we have seen four years of good growth and this year is a difficult year due to things beyond our control the rising crude oil prices in the international market has resulted in the rise in inflation the internationally traded commodity prices have gone up over the last one year on which we have no control
2315973 what we are trying to do is given the price effect we are trying to moderate aggregate demand by using tight monetary measures by sacrificing a bit of growth that is the only way in which inflation can be tamed
2315974 it is inevitable that more borrowers coping strategies will come under pressure in current conditions than in the unusually benign years of the last decade
2315975 thats why lenders government and the advice sector are working closely together to minimise the impact on borrowers
2315976 the results of this latest survey of chls broker partners and customers show the difficult circumstances that many intermediaries and their clients are facing

2315978 every penny counts at present and if this can help our broker partners to understand the products available and service offering from both ourselves and link loans and at the same time retain the same income as if they were dealing direct then hopefully we can all use this as a

2316125 the mix of products sold in the last quarter supported stronger profit margins
2316126 consequently the erosion of sales and operating earnings relative to last year was less marked in the third quarter than in the first two quarters of the year furthermore good operating cost management practices and the optimization of production helped offset the impact of competitive pressures and steadily rising energy costs and resin prices
2316127 despite a competitive environment that remains difficult the last few months generated a number of promising developments for the months ahead first there are signs that the compression of profit margins could be in the process of easing in some market segments which would have a positive impact on the companys profitability at the same time the signing in june of a large long term contract for wheeled carts for the city of calgary promises sustained growth for the waste management sector in the coming quarters furthermore the company will soon begin manufacturing a round thin walled container using the in mold labelling iml process the imminent marketing of this container for the specialty dairy product market should have a positive effect on the value of the companys food packaging product sales overall managements short term priorities remain unchanged targeting in particular improvements to operations the development of new value added products expansion of the customer base and organic sales growth
2316128 its not so much social networking its having a social experience around things that we care about so pets are just such a great example of that
2316129 social networks like facebook and myspace are sort of about you and your friends and these very direct connections but theres all sorts of other types of connections
2316130 theres a lot of people out there with their dogs and were busy and were all working in the office all day long and this is a way for us to bring our pets with us

2316172 almost one third of all spam in circulation last week was malicious
2316173 rustock is largely responsible for that the rise in malicious spam and the rise of rustock are directly linked rustock has grown through malicious spam its success in infecting more computers through malicious spam has bred further success it has been able to send even more spam in a kind of ever increasing cycle
2316174 a few weeks ago we said that rustock was having a lot success with these campaigns
2316175 as time has gone on the criminals behind rustock have adjusted the appearance and sophistication of their messages to become more convincing at fooling recipients into infecting themselves as rustock has infected more machines it has enabled the botnet to send more and more spam these two factors have combined to push rustock into first place and the volumes of malicious spam in circulation through the roof
2316176 the increasing professionalism of the criminals behind the major botnets and the growing emphasis on using spam to aid in the distribution of malware is disturbing
2316177 these botnet criminals are earning big money and their revenue is tied to their ability to send increasing volumes of spam on behalf of spammers who pay for the service the end result is that spam is growing becoming more professional and more dangerous every week this also clearly demonstrates a change in botnet tactics in the past botnet operators subscribed to the go low and go slow methodology to escape detection now they are getting a lot bolder and seemingly less concerned about publicity by increasing their activity significantly
2316178 why dont you come here for the weekend its a great place lots of room i have lots of time to chill so yeah come hang out

2316200 i have been let down o my christ by my excessive presumption from the heights i have fallen very low but lift me now again so that i may see that i have deceived myself if again i trust too much in myself i shall fall immediately and the fall will be fatal
2316201 es ist bei einer engen wm wie dieser immer wichtig die bestm glichen punkte aus einem schweren rennen mitzunehmen man kann es sich nicht leisten zu viele punkte liegen zu lassen ich kann also nicht allzu entt uscht sein dass ich nach so einem schwierigen rennen meine f hrung in der weltmeisterschaft ausgebaut habe
2316202 die n chsten wochen habe ich keine arbeitsverpflichtungen also kann ich f r mich selbst sein und zeit mit familie und freunden verbringen ich werde die zeit so verbringen wie ich das will es wird aber eine mischung aus totaler entspannung und dann in der zweiten h lfte der pause intensivem training
2316203 wir wissen dass sie genauso hart pushen werden wie wir damit sie f r den rest des jahres einen vorteil haben wer wei wenn wir in ungarn ein einfacheres rennen gehabt h tten dann h tte uns das sp ter in der saison vielleicht geschadet also bin ich zuversichtlich dass wir nichts als gegeben hinnehmen ich wei dass jeder in woking stuttgart und brixworth voll arbeiten wird um sicherzustellen dass wir bei den verbleibenden rennen stark sind
2316204 das ist ein heikles thema das ist eine reine anekdote aus zweiter oder sogar dritter hand aber es gibt da die geschichte dass einer der red bull fahrer aus seinem renault angetriebenen auto sprang und dann den ferrari angetriebenen wagen fuhr und meinte verdammte h lle richtig oder falsch das wei ich nicht und ich will damit auch nicht den finger auf ferrari richten
2316205 es l uft so dass man eine blaupause des motors macht wenn man ihn erstmals einsetzt die wird an die fia geschickt und dort archiviert wenn man dann zur halbzeit der saison probleme mit den kolbenringen hat und sehr viele gebrochen sind dann kann man unter vorlage von beweisen sagen dass man probleme hat und die fia wird einen den kolbenring oder dieses und jenes ndern lassen
2316206 es ist technisch faszinierend und wichtig und der einzige nachteil ist dass die autos etwas leiser sein werden
2316207 ein teil davon w rde jedoch kostensenkungen bewirken also werden sie es sicher fr her machen wollen
2316208 wenn man die zur verf gung stehende energie begrenzt und dann mehr aus dieser menge an energie herausholt gewinnt man das rennen
2316209 jetzt sind die hinterherfahrenden autos weniger effizient als die vorne also muss man die aerodynamik so umbauen dass das hintere auto durch den umstand dass es hinter einem anderen auto f hrt schneller wird dann gibt es sehr gutes racing
2316210 ich bin dagegen weil man nicht grundlegend in den sport eingreifen sollte
2316211 es ist okay es in der gp2 zu machen aber die formel 1 hat eine gewisse tradition die jeder versteht wir k nnen die probleme auch ohne eingriffe in diese struktur l sen
2316212 clouds of war are still hovering over parts of the world
2316213 the doha round of global trade talks lapsed back into limbo on tuesday as a ministerial meeting to rescue the round collapsed after nine days of tense negotiations
2316214 its clearly not a success but no one will want to say that its the end of the round
2316215 thank god no deal was reached because the proposal under consideration would have exacerbated the serious economic food security and social problems now rocking numerous countries
2316216 the moldering corpse of the doha wto expansion round should have been buried years ago hopefully after this latest rejection of the doha agenda countries will move on to a new agenda focused on fixing the existing wto rules
2316217 now that wto expansion has been again rejected at this make or break meeting
2316218 elected officials and those on the campaign trail in nations around the world including u s presidential candidates will be asked what they intend to do to replace the failed wto model and its version of corporate globalization with something that benefits the majority of people worldwide
2316219 so much of left wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who dont even know that fire is hot
2316220 noting anxiety among many u s domestic audiences about the u s economic outlook goolsbee candidly acknowledged the protectionist sentiment that has emerged particularly in the midwest during the primary campaign
2316221 he goolsbee cautioned that this messaging should not be taken out of context and should be viewed as more about political positioning than a clear articulation of policy plans
2316222 the catholic and the communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest and intelligent
2316223 he must be a good decent right winger like me think ill quote him
2316224 mark my word if and when these preachers get control of the republican party and theyre sure trying to do so its going to be a terrible damn problem frankly these people frighten me politics and governing demand compromise but these christians believe they are acting in the name of god so they cant and wont compromise i know ive tried to deal with them
2316225 i think every good christian ought to kick falwell right in the ass
2316226 the big thing is to make this country along with every other country in the world with a few exceptions quit discriminating against people just because theyre gay you dont have to agree with it but they have a constitutional right to be gay and thats what brings me into it
2316227 ponti i see by your posts you dont have any problem with exercising protectionism when it comes to paying your taxes or forcing christianity upon people selective protectionism is what you practice as long as you can profit from it
2316228 you dont give a crap about offshoring american jobs so businesses that hide their money in offshore accounts and dont pay their taxes can maximize profits while screwing american workers over
2316229 increased its estimate for next years deficit to nearly 490 billion a record figure that will saddle the next president with deepening budget problems in his first year in office
2316230 as stark as any bonkers tin hut preacher from the quivering brethren shouting repent or burn evolution or god take your choice kid the moment one of them found an ammonite on the beach professor dawkins demanded instant atheism
2316231 ok he is provoked as we all are by nutters but most believers are not creationists
2316232 the position i have always adopted is that much of animal nature is indeed altruistic cooperative and even attended by benevolent subjective emotions but that this follows from rather than contradicts selfishness at the genetic level
2316233 theres this thing called being so open minded your brains drop out
2316234 flowers and elephants are for the same thing as everything else in the living kingdoms for spreading duplicate me programs written in dna language flowers are for spreading copies of instructions for making more flowers elephants are for spreading copies of instructions for making more elephants
2316235 our shortfall in sales this quarter was due to our inability to ship approximately 8 million in orders due to unavailable inventory we had strategically reduced inventory levels during our last fiscal year expecting that our suppliers could timely replenish components which they were not able to do this problem was compounded by our strong sales performance in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 for certain key products we however expect to recover the sales shortfall over the next quarter
2316236 our sales shortfall is not an indication of the demand for our products and u s department store retail sell through which remains strong and far ahead of last fiscal year despite the difficult retail environment our promotional spending during the first quarter increased sell through of our paris hilton and guess brands which we believe will result in higher orders for the important upcoming holiday season the inventory shortage will not affect the initial orders for jessica simpsons fancy which recently commenced shipping nor for our new paris hilton fragrance fairy dust which will ship in september
2316237 in spite of our first quarter production difficulties it is our expectation that sales for the current quarter and sales and profit for the full fiscal year will significantly exceed those of the prior year comparable periods
2316238 this transaction epitomizes our strategy of transitioning from an asset owner to a strategic asset manager while enabling the company to increase its return on invested capital the value realized from the evening star building demonstrates that even in very challenging markets like todays a well managed blue chip asset located in a prime market will be well valued we are very pleased with our partnership with kanam grund and look forward to making even greater returns on our remaining 5 investment in the evening star building
2316239 this asset has performed very well for us and it has been a great result for kanam grund to acquire an even greater stake in it we look forward to continuing our successful relationship with resource america
2316240 simultaneous with the buy out kanam grund refinanced the property on a long term basis with a large german bank showing that even in the current capital market environment capital is available for a trophy property backed by a reliable institutional sponsor such as kanam grund
2316241 i am a most unhappy man i have unwittingly ruined my country a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is concentrated the growth of the nation therefore and all our activities are in the hands of a few men we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men
2316242 authority received as the truth rather than truth as the authority
2316243 ambition saw that stooping rome could bear a master nor had virtue to be free
2316244 and on his brow ore daring vice deluding virtue smild
2316245 by the fundamental laws of england the two houses of parliament in concert with the king exercise the legislative power but if the two houses should be so infatuated as to resolve to suppress their powers and invest the king with the full and absolute government certainly the nation would not suffer it
2316246 be firm my friends nor let unmanly sloth twine round your hearts indissoluble chains neer yet by force was freedom overcome unless corruption first dejects the pride and guardian vigour of the free born soul all crude attempts of violence are vain determined hold your independence for that once destroyd unfounded freedom is a morning dream
2316247 if we suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty we encourage it and involve others in our doom
2316248 despite significant economic headwinds in the u s and european consumer travel markets we nearly matched last years profits for the second quarter because of our efficiency initiatives and especially strong performance by u s car rental which generated double digit earnings growth in a difficult demand and pricing environment our results were affected by inflation in key areas including fuel vehicle damage and concession fees we are accelerating our efficiency initiatives and now expect to reduce expenses by 300 million this year to help overcome higher inflation additionally we have generated 1 0 billion of levered cash flow over the past seven quarters beating the target we set before the november 2006 ipo to generate a billion dollars of levered cash flow in 3 years net cash provided by operating activities for the same period was 5 3 billion
2316249 this is an extremely exciting deal for the company and inevitably one that results in increased shareholder value while i am marginally disappointed in the current price per share we are confident that in the long run lucky linda and other opportunities presented the company including erhu and our increasing holdings diversification will simultaneously reward our loyal shareholders and thwart any potential naked short selling activities or market abuses i would like to reassure shareholders that while growing the companys bottom line is our day to day business we are examining any potentially negative market activities impeding our long term value and exploring direct means of recourse
2316250 at labwire we have always strived to provide the markets and our shareholders with the best visibility and clarity into our corporate intentions and management direction and decisions
2316251 the company is ready to embark on growth to the next level of business development and market presence we have achieved record results in revenue and financial performance we thought this was a good time to answer some questions that have come to us through our shareholder base we are planning a shareholder conference and will be announcing plans for that in the near future we appreciate our shareholder support and look forward to the future with much excitement
2316252 the company continues to do well in a difficult economic environment with rising costs for ingredients energy and transportation as well as slower sales growth in retail chains and the food service sector we have been successful in overcoming these challenges by carefully managing our controllable costs as well as by generating significant additional business from both new and existing customers
2316253 with our growth in sales into the retail sector we expect to see some increased seasonality in our business
2316254 retail sales of frozen foods historically have trended higher in the winter months our second quarter and lower in the summer our fourth quarter
2316255 we are scheduled to start this new product rollout late in the fourth quarter
2316256 and we anticipate realizing the full impact of this new business in the first quarter of fiscal 2009
2316257 obviously a period to period comparison is made difficult by the significant revenue recognized in 2007 when cpa 16 global met its hurdle return
2316258 however on a comparable basis we are pleased with our performance as reflected in our adjusted cash flow from operations this solid performance was all the more significant because of the drop in investment volume we experienced in the second quarter which reflected both unusually high investment volume in the second quarter of last year and an unusually low investment volume of 88 million for the second quarter of this year we are already seeing a pickup in investment volume and have closed investments of 127 million thus far this quarter in addition we continue to benefit from strong occupancies across our portfolios a terrific balance sheet and an ability to grow our business without reliance on the public capital markets in times of tighter credit markets we believe there are attractive investment opportunities for sale leaseback investors and we are very well positioned today to take advantage of them
2316259 we are pleased to partner with bancvue and first roi
2316260 by leveraging rewardchecking and the online marketing power of the firstbranch platform our community banks can generate new account applications and leads attract new customers add significant core deposits at a low cost of funds and dominate their market

2316267 auroras 2008 work program aims to progress community efforts and demonstrate resource value
2316268 the positive results recorded for the second quarter are the direct result of the focus we are placing on our cruise loyalty programs now that we have divested ourselves of all non cruise related businesses there is continued growth in the cruise industry despite the economy but consumers now more than ever are looking for true value when making purchases with seamiles offering cruisers the most rewards and flexibility of any cruise loyalty program in the market place consumers are seeing the true value in what we have to offer
2316269 since my appointment as chief executive officer of global it i have been working diligently towards bringing the company up to date on all of its administrative obligations i am pleased to give you some information regarding the direction of the company in the coming weeks and months the company will have a name change and a ticker symbol change this change will not include a reverse split of the stock we will continue to be a holding company but under a new name and new board of directors also included in this will be the addition of a company that we have completed a letter of intent with it is a green tech company based out of the san francisco bay area who will be a subsidiary of the newly formed company the company is expanding rapidly and has some pretty exciting things being developed i will ensure that shareholders are updated as we progress towards value
2316270 since the initial launch of the private beta tripsay has attracted tremendous interest and a strong following of thousands of recreational adventurous and activity driven vacationers
2316271 were continuing to add new social travel features and usability improvements to help our users connect with fellow travelers find trustworthy information and ultimately make the most of their travel experiences near and far
2316272 the thought of playing live for the first time ever and on top of that doing it in the presence of j nsi birgisson and alex somers triggered a bit of panic in the hammock galaxy
2316273 but it presented us with a wonderful opportunity not only to meet two artists who have meant so much to us but also to approach our music in a totally new way
2316274 some of the visual artists that andrew and i admire the most will deliberately restrict themselves to working within a single medium to stir and focus themselves creatively thats the approach we took for both the performance and the album
2316275 as expected our revenue growth slowed due to summer seasonality and a reduction in wholesale orders as retailers sold through existing inventory in preparation for the fall rollout of our new and expanded product lines
2316276 our net loss was also in line with our expectations and up from last year due to increased g amp a supporting a far larger annual sales base as we head into the fall quarter were running all factories at full capacity to support our rollout into thousands of new retail storefronts in the next few months also noteworthy is the 174 increase in our revenues from seed kits and accessories year over year as we achieve increased levels of repeat sales from customers adopting the aerogarden as an ongoing part of their lives
2316277 this is a very important day for all miraculins stakeholders
2316278 this is the first transaction for the company after recently announcing our new focus on technology that has completed early research and discovery work it clearly demonstrates the need for a company such as miraculins to bridge the gap between the discovery of quality technology and its commercialization and shows miraculins capacity to work with world class research institutions such as mount sinai hospital
2316279 cases of preeclampsia continue to increase as more women are using in vitro fertilization having multiples and getting pregnant at an older age which all contribute to the increased risk of developing this serious disease
2316280 our goal is to develop a diagnostic test so that physicians dont have to rely on symptoms alone to determine if a patient has preeclampsia and i am very excited to be working with the miraculins team to achieve this goal and ensure better outcomes for mothers and babies
2316281 the quality of the research and peer reviewed publications by dr caniggia and her collaborators combined with the independent new england journal of medicine study showing the power of endoglin clearly establishes the quality of this biomarker portfolio
2316282 we immediately plan to begin executing an aggressive development plan with the objective of helping millions of women around the world at risk from this potentially fatal condition
2316283 ich bin mir sicher dass es leute gegeben h tte die gerne dort gesessen h tten es sich aber nicht leisten konnten
2316284 wenn es meine entscheidung w re w rde ich die kosten senken denn wenn die karten g nstig genug w ren w rden auch leute kommen aber das ist ein bernie problem
2316285 der ferrari hat prinzipiell mehr neigung zum untersteuern als der mclaren der mclaren bersteuert eher wenn der reifen guten grip hat dann wird das auto mit der tendenz zum bersteuern ber eine einzelne runde schneller sein als ein neutrales oder untersteuerndes auto
2316286 es wird uns schmerzen dass vettel im kommenden jahr nicht bei uns ist
2316287 das macht das leben einerseits recht einfach aber es bedeutet auch dass wir im vergleich zu einigen konkurrenten immer auf der rasierklinge spazieren wir k mpfen immer vielleicht sehen sie uns manchmal als ein wenig aggressiv aber wir m ssen uns um uns k mmern
2316288 ich denke aber auch dass wir uns gut um die partner k mmern weil wir das m ssen wir haben wirklich die einstellung dass wir uns um die leute k mmern und das kommt von franks seite es gibt also leute die bei einem unabh ngigen team sein wollen sie wollen aber nicht bei einem schwachen team sein sie wollen bei einem konkurrenzf higen team sein wir hatten unsere hochs und tiefs aber ich denke wir sind immer noch ein f hrendes team in der formel 1 wir m ssen das nur besser demonstrieren
2316289 wir sind hier um jedes rennen voll zu bestreiten und nicht ein halbes jahr wir haben zwei verschiedene programme eines das im moment viel mehr ressourcen hat als das andere
2316290 es w re ideal ein indisches team mit einem einheimischen fahrer zu haben um den patriotismus der fans zu entfachen aber ich h tte das cockpit gerne wegen meiner qualit t und nicht wegen meiner nationalit t
2316291 im schwesterteam toro rosso sind beide pl tze zu haben aber ich war neben red bull auch noch mit einem spitzenteam wegen eines testplatzes in kontakt

2316293 in der pause im august haben wir genug zeit auf den pr fst nden um f r valencia wirklich alles ordentlich zu scannen und zu tunen
2316294 es gab einige gr nde f r die aufh ngung einiges davon war auch wegen der neu organisierten gruppe die ein einigerma en gro es projekt abarbeiten sollte bevor es an das neue auto geht wir haben ein paar neue manager in der firma und wir haben auch ein neues cad system also war es gut ein recht gro es projekt zu haben um das system zu pr fen denn wir konnten es uns nicht leisten operative probleme zu haben
2316295 wenn man sich die elektronischen systeme ansieht dann ist das recht normale technologie weswegen die leute sich eher daf r entscheiden als f r die etwas komplizierteren mechanischen systeme die viele probleme machen

2316298 die hersteller verstehen dass sie unabh ngige teams brauchen sonst gibt es nur f nf hersteller teams die herumfahren und das ist in niemandes interesse
2316299 das wird die kosten reduzieren und ich denke niemand kann abstreiten dass dies der weg ist den wir gehen sollen
2316300 wir haben motoren f r zwei rennen und das sollten wir nach m glichkeit ausbauen alle waren in der lage damit umzugehen die formel 1 braucht kleinere teams im moment ist es sehr hart umk mpft und wir liegen innerhalb von zwei sekunden hinter der schnellsten rundenzeit und das machen wir mit 120 millionen dollar
2316301 we are extremely disappointed by the department of transportations auction announcement that completely ignores strong opposition from key members of congress the dots own task force including consumer groups on new york delays and the port authority and airlines dots auction proposal is unlawful unwise and will do absolutely nothing to reduce congestion and flight delays in new york dot has left us no options we will sue to prevent this illegal action

2316338 i think its really important and will be for many of our listeners to know your responses to that point of disappointment back there someplace and i really appreciate your willingness to do so
2316339 i think that theres plenty of that blame to go around including very greedy people that happen to be in wall street today like the ceo chief executive officer of bear stearns nyse bsc e who decided the day before he was bailed out by the federal government to cash in millions of dollars worth of stock

2316343 while some democrats like to fantasize that an obama kaine ticket might attract votes from anti abortion social conservatives it could also alienate or at least unsettle feminists who backed hillary clinton and have yet to fully embrace obamas candidacy
2316344 the latest figure on u s gdp is a case in point according to mr porter gdp is not a fail safe measure of economic health in the case of the united states the figure defies logic because of falling employment levels and the devastation of the housing market all that is supporting gdp growth is a stimulus package defence spending and strong exports

2316349 it is possible for an american president to advance the peace process to achieve meaningful progress it is also necessary more necessary now than it has ever been
2316350 as you know it is not generally expected that they will do this in the first year or two of their administration
2316351 president clinton did not do it until his last year in office and president bush now is saying that he is going to try and do something im not bragging about myself but i started in the first two months of my administration we finished it the second year i was in office it is possible to achieve progress if you start early enough and make it clear that peace is a priority of the administration
2316352 peace will come when the arabs love their children more than they hate us
2316353 all our top military commanders recognize that there is no military solution in iraq
2316354 weve got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that were just air raiding villages and killing civilians which is causing enormous pressure there
2316355 if you had to do it over again knowing what you know now would you support the surge
2316356 keep in mind these kinds of hypotheticals are very difficult hindsight is 20 20 but i think that what im absolutely convinced of is that at that time we had to change the political debate because the view of the bush administration at that time was one that i just disagreed with

2316409 fruit of many years of research in partnership with the rsw group and beroma and the development phase with rocmec mining inc this concept is a viable solution for small scale mining the whole team worked tirelessly on this new concept of modular treatment plants that has a capacity of 75 metric tonnes per day
2316410 the project was completely financed through the private sector it is quite evident that the current price of gold favours the development of the umco 75 f the combination of thermal fragmentation and the umco 75 f is a winning receipt both projects are very complementary

2316413 contract that creates an additional paid holiday eid al fitr a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
2316414 union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
2316415 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
2316416 if this holiday is that important to them make them take it off instead of christmas day and allow all workers to be off labor day most american families have some type of function on labor day
2316417 it says union leadership made this request makes you wonder who runs the union i guess they are already working on a plan to replace memorial day that means nothing to the muslims so why should we have the right to celebrate it labor day commemorates the plight of workers and the struggle of labor unions to improve working conditions for american workers the muslims will not stop until all of our rights and laws are changed to accommodate their beliefs this will be a new america but it will be their america
2316418 diversity is one of the strengths of our union we may come from different countries and speak different languages but what unites us is the belief that by standing together we can better advance our interests
2316419 the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
2316420 two prayer rooms have been created to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
2316421 this is america founded by the blood of our forefathers and should not be challenged by somalians hispanics or any other immigrants if they come to america they need to learn our language and our ways they can practice their culture in private if they so please but not shove it down our throats would they let us go there and change their country i have banned tysons products from my home for years because of the illegals they were hiring i am sorry for the producers that are supplying them but tysons has once again crossed the line with the american people labor day was here long before tysons what holiday will be next to be taken away and replaced to accommodate an immigrant this stinks worse than the plant
2316422 disgusting appalling horrifying there just arent enough words to describe this situation there will never be another tyson product in my home ever bedford county and the rest of the nation needs to take notice is this what we are coming to
2316423 we are pleased with the operating performance the operating earnings for the six months to june 2008 of 320 million were ahead of our own expectations
2316424 excluding aljustrel which is in a pre production phase production of metal contained in concentrate was better than expected and we have accordingly increased our full year production forecast for copper and nickel
2316425 aljustrel has always been identified as a low grade high cost mine and it is not viable at current zinc prices management is studying alternative scenarios for the aljustrel mine which may include an earlier extraction of the known copper resources however we consider it prudent to reduce our carrying value in line with the residual value of the assets a decision on the future of aljustrel is likely before the end of the third quarter the situation remains uncertain and there may be further impairment charges arising from additional capital and pre production operating expenditures at aljustrel
2316426 our results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations and reflect the strong product demand that we continue to experience in our key end markets aluminum and railroads we also benefited from higher pricing in some of our downstream chemical products due to higher oil prices we expect that the positive momentum in our end markets and our core businesses will continue for the rest of 2008 and through 2009 we continue to be optimistic about 2009 in particular when the expansion of our existing coal tar distillation plant and the construction of our new coal tar distillation plant are expected to be completed and operational we also expect to be able to pursue opportunities for acquisitions and refinancing as a result of the sale of our interest in the monessen coke facility as always we believe we will continue to benefit from our focus on enhancing cash flow and our strict adherence to safety health and environmental regulations
2316427 based on the strength of our second quarter results and the outlook for the remainder of 2008 we are increasing our guidance our revised expectations for 2008 after eliminating the operating impact of monessen for all periods are that sales should increase in the 14 to 17 percent range from restated 2007 sales of 1 255 6 million adjusted ebitda should increase in the 14 to 17 percent range from restated 2007 adjusted ebitda of 161 7 million and that diluted eps should increase in the 37 to 41 percent range from restated 2007 adjusted eps of 2 49 per share
2316428 even with federal funds at 2 percent there are very few people taking advantage of it or getting a great deal
2316429 there hasnt been a massive debt buildup at these low interest rates unlike the last episode
2316430 if you look at measures of wage and salary costs theres no current evidence whatsoever to support the notion that theres an inflation problem

2316446 over the next year we see significant opportunities for the deployment of capital based on new streams investment philosophy we are particularly optimistic about direct commercial lending opportunities that have developed as traditional lenders and banks have pulled back
2316447 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly

2316449 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
2316450 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer consumers dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
2316451 for the manufacturers its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs

2316469 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly

2316477 this announcement is yet another example of how this government is providing the men and women of the canadian forces the tools and equipment they need to do the jobs asked of them
2316478 ultimately these capabilities coupled with other key acquisitions by this government will be invaluable to our military leaders in the protection of canadian interests in our sovereign territory and abroad for years our canadian forces have been in the unfortunate position of not having an option other than hitching rides with allies in order to move personnel in countries like afghanistan those days are over
2316479 these projects demonstrate the governments commitment to ensuring that the men and women of the canadian forces have the resources and equipment they require
2316480 by actively procuring helicopters and uavs to be available within stringent timelines we are helping to support urgent operational requirements in afghanistan while providing best value for canadian taxpayers

2316508 the government has a role in putting the brakes on private sector excesses
2316509 we are here having impeachment hearings before the judiciary committee
2316510 i never imagined i would ever be sitting on this side when something like this happened
2316511 numerous credible allegations of serious misconduct by officials in the bush administration
2316512 to the regret of many this is not an impeachment hearing
2316513 the most impeachable administration in the history of our country
2316514 there is a real question of whether this constitution is being protected
2316515 what this congress does or chooses not to do in furthering the investigation of the serious allegations against this administration and if just cause is found to hold them accountable will impact the conduct of future presidents perhaps for generations
2316516 there are those who would say that holding this hearing examining whether or not the president and vice president broke the law is frivolous i not only reject this i believe there is no task more important for this congress than to seriously consider whether our nations leaders have violated their oath of office the american public expects no less it is after all their constitution no president or congress has the authority to override that document whereby we the people conferred upon the branches of government limited and defined power and provided for meaningful checks and balances
2316517 on january 20 2009 the next president and vice president of the united states will stand before the american people and take an oath of office swearing to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states
2316518 presidents and vice presidents do not take that oath in a vacuum they are informed by the actions or inactions of past presidents and congresses who establish precedents for the future
2316519 its not about whats good for the us its about their hatred of conservatives
2316520 he used the nsa to wire tap international calls where a person on the terrorist watch list was outside the us some of these calls had us citizens on the other end of the line in the us but that is not the same thing as deploying the nsa against the public
2316521 prisoners of war and illegal combatants were captured and held by the military
2316522 amendment x the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
2316523 we have consistently applied article 3 of geneva even though technically the terrorists do not meet the criteria for identifying them as true prisoners of war
2316524 these minimal protections pontificus apply even when the persons taken arent partisans of a convention signatory the interrogation methods used in many cases would constitute humiliating and degrading treatment
2316525 likewise scotus held that elements of the commissions as they were at the time of this opinion didnt afford the minimal judicial guarantees
2316526 regardless of whether their country of origin has signed the geneva convention the combatants themselves do not meet the standards for protection as soldiers reportedly most of them fully that they are terrorists with no uniform and no intent to fight as soldiers they are illegal combatants in the same category as spies and saboteurs
2316527 admitted that iraq approached niger about obtaining yellowcake uranium but that iraq was not successful
2316528 on whether waterboarding is torture the international laws against torture dont list waterboarding they outlaw procedures causing physical injury or harm
2316529 any act by which severe pain or suffering whether physical or mental is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or a third person or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity it does not include pain or suffering arising only from inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions
2316530 of course bush knew that tapping phones in countries outside the us was a violation of us law and of course he knew the dozens of lawyers convincing him otherwise were wrong and that hed lose before the scotus
2316531 containing soviet communism said brzezinski dictated an avoidance of anything that might split islamic opposition to the soviets especially a u
2316532 what is more important to the history of the world
2316533 after 2001 the bush administration appeared to sign on to the neoconservative declaration that the world was defined by a clash of civilizations and launched its global war on terrorism targeting al qaeda the most virulent strain of the very virus that the united states had helped create
2316534 the next 15 years may well be the age of superterrorism when they the islamic terrorist ed gain access to weapons of mass destruction and show a new willingness to use them
2316535 the war against terrorism is a war with an unlimited number of battles none of them decisive what price are we prepared to pay the price will be financial and personal people will have to accept longer lines before entering buildings longer delays at airports more intrusive searches of belongings and our persons and higher ticket prices to pay for all of this greater vigilance will also involve a willingness to compromise some of our civil liberties including accepting more frequent phone taps and surveillance those who would resist paying such a price should keep in mind that terrorism could well get worse in the coming years there is evidence that the terrorist challenge is entering a new phase
2316536 as america becomes an increasingly multicultural society it may find it more difficult to fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues except in the circumstances of a truly massive and widely perceived direct external threat such a consensus generally existed throughout world war ii and even during the cold war it was rooted in a cultural and ethnic affinity for the predominantly european victims of hostile totalitarianisms in the absence of a comparable external challenge american society may find it much more difficult to reach agreement regarding foreign policies
2316537 the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor
2316538 why more had not been done to take defensive measures in response to the threat reporting over the spring and summer
2316539 she told the commission the public wasnt prepared to support president bushs effort to take drastic action against al qaeda
2316540 rumsfeld acknowledged the spike in reports of possible al qaeda attacks in the spring and summer of 2001 saying there was a good deal of concern
2316541 the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary
2316542 if they go for impeachement with months left in the bush presidency the public will throw out the dems for being complete boobs and panderin
2316543 do you approve or disapprove of the way the democrats in congress are doing their job
2316544 do you approve or disapprove of the way the republicans in congress are doing their job
2316545 such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal
2316546 the real point of your agenda is to pick up any random cudgel that you think might be useful in damaging the administration and if it ends up helping terrorists thats just the breaks right
2316547 terrorist are not covered by the gc because they do not wear uniforms and cannot be connected to a specific government
2316548 if president bush wiretapped american citizens without the approval of a judge do you agree or disagree that congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment
2316549 the american people are not buying bushs outrageous claim that he has the power to wiretap american citizens without a warrant americans believe terrorism can be fought without turning our own government into big brother
2316550 hsub has a 19 job approval rating in wisconsin and new hampshire
2316551 if president bush did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with iraq congress should consider holding him accountable through impeachment
2316552 you want agreement on the opinion that bush knew the intellegence was wrong even though all the democrats in congress thought it was right
2316553 after the ruling bush complied but before the ruling he didnt know it was against the law
2316554 they are called courts martial and they can be convened summarily on the battlefield if necessary
2316555 so if you tap a phone in france you havent violated us law
2316556 but us mere mortals had to wait for the scotus to clarify what the law meant
2316557 yes his naivet was a mistake but it was not a crime
2316558 i believe in my heart of hearts that bush tried his best to protect america from further attacks
2316559 i know he honestly believed saddam had wmds and that if left alone saddam would eventually have nukes even if it took 20 years he was determined to have them
2316560 that said there is no evidence that bush ever ordered the use of torture
2316561 conducted and maintained solely for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence information
2316562 object of the search or the surveillance is a foreign power its agent or collaborators
2316563 that said there is no evidence that bush ever ordered the use of torture
2316564 i think that given the number of actions we were able to prevent because of the information we have gathered from these 3 key al qaeda figures the action back then was worth it
2316565 oh we can never actually know how many have been prevented
2316566 anybody notice how the right give a pass not even a
2316567 i think that given the number of actions we were able to prevent because of the information we have gathered from these 3 key al qaeda figures the action back then was worth it

2316656 the data from this study are very promising and suggest that cvac could provide a unique way to lower blood glucose levels in certain individuals
2316657 given that these positive results were achieved in middle aged non diabetic volunteers we are hopeful that cvac will prove even more effective in diabetic subjects with higher initial fasting glucose levels these data are consistent with our understanding of the mechanism by which hypoxia or low oxygen levels could impact glucose metabolism
2316658 while we expect outstanding results from the application of cvac in diabetes our next clinical trial is in diabetic neuropathy
2316659 diabetic neuropathy afflicts 70 percent of the type 2 diabetics in the us with two million patients displaying symptomatic neuropathy which is often an extremely painful condition with no effective treatment furthermore diabetic neuropathy is associated with more than 1000 amputations per week in the us demonstrating a large unmet clinical need for an effective therapy based on preliminary studies we expect cvac will do much more than alleviate pain we expect the planned course of clinical studies to show that regular long term cvac use restores the health and function of the damaged tissues in addition to alleviating pain
2316660 we are excited about the potential for the cvac process to produce an improvement in both the condition and quality of life for diabetes and diabetic neuropathy patients
2316661 we are still researching the mechanism but if use of cvac attenuates insulin resistance it is possible that cvac could also be useful in treating other disorders related to insulin resistance and the aging process

2316671 such disease specific stem cells offer an unprecedented opportunity to recapitulate both normal and pathologic human tissue formation in vitro thereby enabling disease investigation and drug development
2316672 are in some ways broader and more important than embryonic stem cells in that they represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models

2316725 casts serious doubt on his judgment and calls into question his priorities
2316726 at that point it was a political trip for senator obama
2316727 i think it would have been inappropriate for him to visit the hospital and certainly he would have been criticized by the mccain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in europe paid for by political funds not the taxpayers to go essentially then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign
2316728 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he impugns motives and when we start to get into youre less patriotic than me im more patriotic johns better than that
2316729 could the man running for the highest office in the united states of america a job with incredible stress possibly suffer from ptsd
2316730 among u s servicemen taken captive during the korean war as many as nine out of 10 survivors may suffer from post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and other mental disorders more than 35 years after their release
2316731 mccain and his aides were so desperate to find something to complain about that they would have attacked obama no matter what he did
2316732 it is this fair test that john mccain has in recent days been failing badly
2316733 there is no question that mccain has been hit hard by the success of barack obamas trip to afghanistan iraq the middle east and europe
2316734 desperate to find something to complain about mccain seized on the fact that obama did not visit wounded u s troops at ramstein air base in germany
2316735 and take away the telepromter of preprepared speeches and his syntax rivals bush
2316736 one of the fatal flaws of the blogisphere opinions are like assholes everyone has one
2316737 i dont see anyone saying anything in the campaign speeches but i do see the msm falling all over themselves for obama i see them dragging him over the finish line into the wh
2316738 like i told you mask your analytical and predictive ability will eventually improve
2316739 all of the countrys he visited have voted in conservative govts and obie aint in there club muchless there league yet
2316740 i basically met with the same folks that john mccain met with after he won the nomination the illinois senator said
2316741 part of the job that im applying for and so i was puzzled by this notion that somehow what we were doing was in any way different from what senator mccain or a lot of presidential candidates have done in the past obama said
2316742 now i admit we did it really well but that shouldnt be a strike against me
2316743 the fact is we had four years of failed policy we were losing we were losing the war in iraq the consequences of failure and defeat of the united states of america in the first major conflict since 9 11 would have had devastating impacts throughout the region and the world
2316744 we have a lot of work to do its a very hard struggle particularly given the situation on the iraq pakistan border
2316745 im running for president of the united states because i want to help with family values and i think that family values are important when we have two parent families that are of parents that are the traditional family
2316746 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need
2316747 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
2316748 we should be able to deliver bottled hot water to dehydrated babies
2316749 im glad to have his endorsement i condemn remarks that are in any way viewed as anti anything and thanks for asking
2316750 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
2316751 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
2316752 f k you i know more about this than anyone else in the room
2316753 americans are very frustrated and they have every right to be weve wasted a lot of our most precious treasure which is american lives
2316754 i will conduct a respectful debate now it will be dispirited it will be spirited because there are stark differences i am a proud conservative liberal republica conservative republican hello easy there
2316755 you know that old beach boys song bomb iran bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran
2316756 obama is the most liberal members of govt as far as one can see
2316757 govts in europe are at best a difference bewteen 2 opposing socialist groups
2316758 between two or more privatising and free market fetishizing parties that have been with varying success trying to implement thatcherism and reaganism across the continent through the banking system if they couldnt do it at the ballot box
2316759 no one is to the left of obam in europe or america on any measure or definitions even the cable networks will take that as a given obama is as far away from conservative thought as one can get a case could be made obama is closer to marx than any thing resembling a conservative
2316760 no one is to the left of obama in europe or america on any measure or definitions
2316761 americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its got to be fixed
2316762 and take away the telepromter of preprepared speeches and his syntax rivals bush
2316763 there is no question that mccain has been hit hard by the success of barack obamas trip to afghanistan iraq the middle east and europe
2316764 hagel the republican really not perceived as one here in nebraska
2316765 bernie going green green with other peoples money no surprise here
2316766 to those who may chose mccain as president i beg and pray you study these next words carefully he has chosen as his foreign policy and defense advisers the same neo cons who advised bush into iraq
2316767 oh well weve won but were still succeeding and later well have victory even though weve already won but we cant leave or we will lose and right now were succeeding and weve also won
2316768 obamas ideas are good but there is just no money to pay for them
2316769 protecting americas vast environmental treasures such as our national parks national forests and the arctic national wildlife refuge is a bipartisan tradition stretching back to teddy roosevelt these special places are part of our natural and our national heritage i have strongly supported protection of the arctic national wildlife refuge the arctic refuge is part of what makes our country unique beautiful and precious during my time in the senate i have worked to ensure that the arctic refuge will not be opened to unnecessary development i am an original cosponsor of legislation that would protect the refuge by designating it as a protected wilderness area in addition i have voted against opening the refuge to drilling at every opportunity during my time in the senate drilling for oil in the arctic refuge is bad environmental policy and it is bad energy policy it would take ten years of drilling in the arctic refuge to roduce oil we do not need to despoil an environmental treasure on a gamble for oil where the odds of finding significant supplies are remote
2316770 tell me doc what have you got against our military heroes
2316771 but cant leave in 16 months or do you disagree with mccain on that
2316772 god hypocrisy and stupidity are hilarious to me its funny that someone can actually believe stupid generalizations like these
2316773 ponti join the military and then you will understand my post
2316774 zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz wake me up when it is my turn to ride in the peoples truck comradezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
2316775 is that too complicated for those of you on the left to understand
2316776 but that the peace is still precarious and a precipitous withdrawal would create a security vacuum that the terrorist could easily exploit
2316777 won in iraq we can begin a pull out and get out in 16 months
2316778 yeah thats right mccain said wed won back in summer 2008 so now its safe to withdraw
2316779 alaska is a big place the penguins will have to step aside for awhile
2316780 obama is the most liberal members of govt as far as one can see given he has only been there for 140 days
2316781 no one is to the left of obam in europe or america on any measure or definitions even the cable networks will take that as a given obama is as far away from conservative thought as one can get a case could be made obama is closer to marx than any thing resembling a conservative
2316782 no one is to the left of obam sic in europe
2316783 obama is the most liberal members of govt as far as one can see given he has only been there for 140 days
2316784 no one is to the left of obam in europe or america on any measure or definitions even the cable networks will take that as a given obama is as far away from conservative thought as one can get a case could be made obama is closer to marx than any thing resembling a conservative
2316785 no one is to the left of obam sic in europe
2316786 oh and cheneys charity provision on his hbl stock expires when he leaves the wh
2316787 no one is to the left of obam sic in europe
2316788 the only publication that has claimed that o has the
2316789 in the senate obamas liberal voting record belies the centrist themes he strikes on the stump
2316790 mccains gains came because there was an even number of likely voters from each party last month the democrats had an 11 point edge
2316791 im afraid you dont know what youre talking about theres a lot of that going around here so youre not alone one of mccains top priority is the welfare of our veterans and they all know it
2316792 unlike both democratic presidential candidates who took time off the campaign trail to support our troops by voting for the 21st century gi bill senator mccain refused senator mccain might not have voted but he has made his views perfectly clear instead of joining the 75 senators from both parties who voted for the bill and just about every major veterans group all of which supported it senator mccain chose to echo the bush administrations opposition senator mccain claimed the bill would provide too much incentive for the brave men and women who volunteered to serve after 9 11 to leave the armed forces even though a congressional budget office study found that the bills impact on retention would be offset by a matching increase in recruitment senator mccain offered a watered down version of the bill that would have offered a reduced benefit and required many veterans to pay out of their own pockets to receive it
2316793 before the 2006 congressional elections disabled american veterans published a list of how members of congress voted on veteran legislation
2316794 in 2005 barack obama was rated at 92 in 2006 obama was an 80
2316795 also in 2004 the retired enlisted association rated mccain at zero in 2003 the american legion gave mccain a 50 in 2006 iraq and afghanistan veterans of america graded mccain a d on an a f scale hey gave barack obama a b and during the recent debates over webbs gi bill both the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars said mccain was wrong not to support the bill
2316796 well im all i can say is that every day on this site im reminded of george orwells description of a leftist as a person who can hold two mutually incompatible ideas in mind at the same time for example freedom is slavery etc in this case it seems to be volunteerism is coercion its all very interesting
2316797 youd better come up with a reliable source for this supposed orwell quote and it had better be a quote not some wingnuts unsourced paraphrase
2316798 they are hiking enlistment bonuses from 8 000 to 10 000
2316799 the spanish war and other events in 1936 37 turned the scale and thereafter i knew where i stood every line of serious work that i have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as i understand it
2316800 now that youve been proven to be a lying sack of crap on obamas voting record
2316801 the liberal lobbying group americans for democratic action gives obama a 100 percent voting rating 5 points to the left of sen ted kennedy who gets a 95 percent grade
2316802 actually obama has the most liberal voting record in the senate 100 percent liberal according to the most widely cited measures
2316803 as with the christian religion the worst advertisement for socialism is its adherents orwell doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in ones mind simultaneously and accepting both of them orwell you never read orwell did you
2316804 im reminded of george orwells description of a leftist as a person who can hold two mutually incompatible ideas in mind at the same time for example freedom is slavery etc in this case it seems to be volunteerism is coercion its all very interesting
2316805 and please notice that i am arguing for socialism not against it
2316806 question a person of this type and you will often get the semi frivolous answer i dont object to socialism but i do object to socialists
2316807 to sum up there is no chance of righting the conditions i described in the earlier chapters of this book or of saving england from fascism unless we can bring an effective socialist party into existence it will have to be a party with genuinely revolutionary intentions and it will have to be numerically strong enough to act we can only get it if we offer an objective which fairly ordinary people will recognize as desirable all that is needed is to hammer two facts home into the public consciousness one that the interests of all exploited people are the same the other that socialism is compatible with common decency
2316808 the spanish war and other events in 1936 37 turned the scale and thereafter i knew where i stood every line of serious work that i have written since 1936 has been written directly or indirectly against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism as i understand it
2316809 when taken together animal farm and 1984 along with his near execution by socialists in spain pretty well points out exactly which side of the aisle he was talking about in terms of doublethink your scholarship is impressive but your selectivity is not
2316810 of course the answer is yes nobody is supposed to criticize barack obama
2316811 you see when republicans relentlessly attack a democrats military service record and position on the issues its acceptable even promoted by the librul media

2316835 bovendien lijken de mensen die meedoen aan de ikz bevraging niet echt consequent vorige algemene vergadering waren er immers voorzitter en bestuursverkiezingen twee kandidaten voor de raad van bestuur hebben een sterk uitgesproken politiek linkse ideologie het lijkt me dan niet meer dan consequent dat je wanneer je in een kwaliteitszorgbevraging aangeeft dat vvs zich politiek neutraler moet opstellen je verzet tegen de aanwezigheid van beide kandidaten in het bestuur de hgsr stond daar blijbaar nagenoeg alleen in dat standpunt pas op ook ik ben ervan overtuigd dat beide kandidaten elk op hun eigen manier goede kandidaten waren ter verdediging van hun toekomstige positie kun je zeggen dat beiden wel kritisch genoeg zullen zijn om zich neutraal op te stellen dat is een hoogst utopische veronderstelling maar het zullen wel diegenen zijn die de kandidatuur van beiden hebben verdedigd die volgend jaar in de ikz zullen aangeven dat vvs zich voortaan politiek neutraal moeten opstellen

2316839 with 250 million passenger cars on the road this equates to 125 billion fewer miles driven at an average 20 miles per gallon this will result in a reduction in gasoline consumption of 6 billion gallons equivalent to 307 million barrels of crude oil

2316885 a la demandante de amparo que prestaba servicios como auxiliar administrativo para la asociaci n provincial del metal aspremetal de badajoz desde junio de 1997 fue despedida el d a 12 de enero de 2004 mediante carta de despido en la que se hac a constar la imposibilidad de mantener sus servicios por el encarecimiento de su n mina y por la innecesariedad de su puesto de trabajo en el mismo acto del despido la empresa reconoci su improcedencia y ofreci a la trabajadora la indemnizaci n legal correspondiente en el momento del despido la trabajadora se encontraba embarazada b formulada demanda en reclamaci n de despido nulo por discriminatorio y subsidiariamente improcedente la sentencia de 24 de marzo de 2004 del juzgado de lo social n m 1 de badajoz rechaz la nulidad del despido al no estimar probado que la empresa conociera el estado de embarazo de la trabajadora y en todo caso no ser ste sino razones organizativas el motivo del despido c interpuesto por la demandante recurso de suplicaci n el mismo fue desestimado salvo en el aspecto relativo al abono de salarios de tramitaci n por sentencia de la sala de lo social del tsj de extremadura de 17 de enero de 2005 que ratific el criterio de la resoluci n de instancia en cuanto a la improcedencia y no nulidad del despido
2316886 ser nulo el despido que tenga por m vil alguna de las causas de discriminaci n prohibidas en la constituci n o en la ley o bien se produzca con violaci n de derechos fundamentales y libertades p blicas del trabajador ser tambi n nulo el despido en los siguientes supuestos a el de los trabajadores durante el per odo de suspensi n del contrato de trabajo por maternidad riesgo durante el embarazo riesgo durante la lactancia natural enfermedades causadas por embarazo parto o lactancia natural adopci n o acogimiento o paternidad al que se refiere la letra d del apartado 1 del art culo 45 o el notificado en una fecha tal que el plazo de preaviso concedido finalice dentro de dicho per odo b el de las trabajadoras embarazadas desde la fecha de inicio del embarazo hasta el comienzo del per odo de suspensi n a que se refiere la letra a y el de los trabajadores que hayan solicitado uno de los permisos a los que se refieren los apartados 4 4 bis y 5 del art culo 37 o est n disfrutando de ellos o hayan solicitado o est n disfrutando la excedencia prevista en el apartado 3 del art culo 46 y el de las trabajadoras v ctimas de violencia de g nero por el ejercicio de los derechos de reducci n o reordenaci n de su tiempo de trabajo de movilidad geogr fica de cambio de centro de trabajo o de suspensi n de la relaci n laboral en los t rminos y condiciones reconocidos en esta ley c el de los trabajadores despu s de haberse reintegrado al trabajo al finalizar los per odos de suspensi n del contrato por maternidad adopci n o acogimiento o paternidad siempre que no hubieran transcurrido m s de nueve meses desde la fecha de nacimiento adopci n o acogimiento del hijo lo establecido en las letras anteriores ser de aplicaci n salvo que en esos casos se declare la procedencia del despido por motivos no relacionados con el embarazo o con el ejercicio del derecho a los permisos y excedencia se alados
2316887 en definitiva nuestra doctrina ha considerado necesario el conocimiento por parte de la empresa del estado de embarazo de la trabajadora para apreciar la existencia de un panorama indiciario de la lesi n del derecho fundamental bien porque conste dicho conocimiento en los hechos probados de las resoluciones recurridas bien porque a n sic no constando expresamente existan otros datos que permitan deducir la probabilidad de la lesi n
2316888 en efecto dif cilmente puede apreciarse la existencia de un tratamiento peyorativo basado en el embarazo de la trabajadora cuando no haya quedado acreditado el conocimiento por la empresa de dicho embarazo o de cualquier otra situaci n o circunstancia que pudiera entenderse conectada con el mismo ni existan otros datos de los que pese a la falta de constancia expresa del conocimiento pueda deducirse la probabilidad de la lesi n
2316889 se declare la procedencia del despido por motivos no relacionados con el embarazo
2316890 la tutela efectiva de los jueces y tribunales en el ejercicio de sus derechos e intereses leg timos
2316891 en funci n de la citada nueva redacci n del precepto legal lo que se discute por la recurrente es la interpretaci n que califica de arbitraria del precepto legal en virtud de la cual para declarar la nulidad del despido de la trabajadora embarazada resulta necesaria la concurrencia de un nimo empresarial discriminatorio y por tanto el conocimiento previo del estado de embarazo
2316892 se trata no obstante de un canon reforzado sstc 84 2001 de 26 de marzo fj 3 215 2001 de 29 de octubre fj 2 203 2002 de 28 de octubre fj 3 y 28 2005 de 14 de febrero fj 3 por tratarse de un supuesto en el que est en juego el derecho fundamental a la no discriminaci n por raz n de sexo art
2316893 sin que a este tribunal garante ltimo de los derechos fundamentales a trav s del recurso de amparo pueda resultarle indiferente aquella cualificaci n cuando se impugnan ante l este tipo de resoluciones pues no s lo se encuentra en juego el derecho a la tutela judicial efectiva sino que puede producirse un efecto derivado o reflejo sobre la reparaci n del derecho fundamental cuya invocaci n sosten a la pretensi n ante el rgano judicial con independencia de que la declaraci n de la lesi n sea s lo una de las hip tesis posibles
2316894 como record bamos recientemente en nuestra stc 34 2008 de 25 de febrero fj 3 constituye doctrina consolidada de este tribunal que las exigencias del derecho a la tutela judicial efectiva son distintas y m s estrictas
2316895 una resoluci n coherente con el derecho fundamental que est en juego
2316896 que exprese o trasluzca lt lt una gt gt con su contenido
2316897 ninguna de dichas resoluciones judiciales se refiere a la sentencia de instancia y a la de la sala social del tribunal superior de justicia de extremadura al resolver el recurso de suplicaci n satisface las exigencias del canos de motivaci n reforzado al que hemos hecho referencia
2316898 la garant a frente al despido del derecho a la no discriminaci n por raz n de sexo de las trabajadoras embarazadas no exige necesariamente un sistema de tutela objetiva como el previsto por el legislador en la ley 39 1999 ser an posibles desde esta perspectiva otros sistemas de protecci n igualmente respetuosos con el art 14 ce como en particular el que estaba en vigor en el momento de la reforma legal sin embargo una vez que el legislador ha optado por un desarrollo concreto del art 14 ce que incrementa las garant as precedentes conect ndolas con una tutela tambi n reforzada de otros derechos y bienes constitucionalmente protegidos no puede el rgano judicial efectuar una interpretaci n restrictiva y ajena a las reglas hermen uticas en vigor que prive al precepto legal de aquellas garant as establecidas por el legislador y con las que la trabajadora pod a razonablemente entenderse amparada en su determinaci n personal pues con ello se estar a impidiendo la efectividad del derecho fundamental de acuerdo con su contenido previamente definido stc 229 2002 de 9 de diciembre fj 4 tal decisi n no satisface las exigencias del canon de razonabilidad y motivaci n reforzadas y de efectividad del derecho fundamental que impone la afectaci n particularmente intensa en el presente caso del derecho a la no discriminaci n por raz n de sexo de la trabajadora y de los restantes derechos y bienes constitucionalmente relevantes implicados
2316899 se est desplazando sutilmente el centro de la discusi n a base de presentar lo que no es m s que una de las interpretaciones posibles del art
2316900 por tanto a la vista de cuanto se ha probado en este caso no es procedente plantear el problema que se puede suscitar por el desconocimiento por la empresa del embarazo como de seguido se razonar
2316901 la singularidad del supuesto que analizamos determina la estimaci n del recurso de casaci n para la unificaci n de doctrina al incurrir la sentencia impugnada en vulneraci n de lo dispuesto en el art culo 55
2316902 si tal como consta la demandante prestaba servicios como oficial de 1 administrativo y su superior jer rquico tuvo conocimiento anticipado del embarazo era de esperar que esa noticia conocida en el departamento de administraci n llegara al rea de los recursos humanos que fue la que decidi despu s el despido y con la que previamente se hab a puesto en contacto el sr juan ignacio para interesarse por las ausencias de la trabajadora no ser a razonable en tal caso exigir a la trabajadora que prestaba servicios para una sociedad an nima con una plantilla de 420 trabajadores que diera conocimiento de su estado al jefe del departamento de rrhh o al consejo de administraci n de la sociedad siendo suficiente con que la noticia llegara al jefe superior de la actora partiendo de esa realidad debe entenderse que la demandante qued al amparo de lo previsto en los art culos 2 y 10 de la directiva 92 85 para ser considerada como trabajadora embarazada y gozar de las garant as que esa norma y el art culo 55 5 del estatuto de los trabajadores le dispensan precepto este violado por la sentencia recurrida al no declarar la nulidad del despido tal como se solicita en petici n principal en la demanda
2316903 la actora a primeros de enero se encontraba embrazada y as lo ha acreditado en el acto del juicio pero no ha sido probado que a la demandada le costase esa circunstancia al no constar la fecha del embarazo ni por tanto si este era o no patente
2316904 su cese en modo alguno ha obedecido a esta motivaci n sino a razones puramente organizativas de la empresa
2316905 la interpretaci n del art culo 55 5 del estatuto de los trabajadores ha de acometerse partiendo de la letra y del esp ritu de la norma misma y del contexto en que se ha promulgado sin olvidar la directiva comunitaria que se ha transpuesto a nuestro ordenamiento interno la directiva 92 85 cee del consejo es bien explicita en cuanto al objeto en que se aplica y a su alcance se refiere como su texto explica a la lt lt durante gt gt la remisi n que en el art culo 10 se hace al art culo 2 supone que a estos efectos por mujer embarazada ha de entenderse a lt lt cualquier gt gt es evidente por tanto que con la reiteraci n normativa sobre los mismos conceptos lo que en realidad se protege en este caso no es la igualdad de sexos sin m s sino la maternidad poniendo a la mujer a salvo de decisiones empresariales motivadas directa o indirectamente por su embarazo evitando con ello la finalizaci n de su relaci n laboral en conexi n con su estado de gravidez
2316906 en cuanto al resultado que deba conseguirse dejando sin embargo a las autoridades nacionales la elecci n de las formas y de los medios
2316907 de conciliaci n de la vida familiar y laboral de las personas trabajadoras

2316927 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2316928 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry

2316957 however the protracted difficult climate on international capital markets and the restraining effects of exchange rate movements have left an appreciable mark on our company too it cannot therefore come as any surprise that our interim result is not insignificantly lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year

2316974 we attribute the accelerated development of intuition to a reorganization of our development teams including a change in leadership and adoption of a new software development methodology over recent months we have devised and adopted a system derived from agile development concepts that allows for constant course corrections based on frequent dialog between subject matter experts and implementing engineers specifically conceived for the particular requirements of medical imaging advanced visualization development as our company and product have matured the scope of our solutions has expanded to large enterprises and we needed a new philosophy and framework for development which would provide a fast and effective channel for input from our target users while empowering our engineering teams to develop rapidly and with optimum relevance key to this process was removal of unnecessary layers between the implementing engineer and the end user and we believe our new streamlined engineering organization is now unparalleled in the industry in terms of vision talent and efficiency
2316975 the intuition duo is a two user server solution that is affordable yet scalable and built upon our true client server architecture the system is capable of opening a study comprised of over 6000 slices to accommodate the most demanding clinical needs and includes all available clinical functionality without compromises representing an unmatched value in the marketplace today intuition duo increases terarecons addressable market by providing a compelling alternative to the bundled oem ct or mr workstation which offers more functionality and anywhere access at the price of a single workstation in todays environment there is virtually no case where a single workstation with a ct or mr scanner is adequate to meet the clinical need and by combining multiple users with the flexibility of true client server architecture we are confident this product will be very popular as an alternative to the advanced visualization offerings normally bundled with imaging modalities
2316976 the opportunities to reach and engage shoppers online are more promising this holiday season than ever before
2316977 however with the increase in online shoppers this holiday season its important to remember that drastically increasing the frequency of email marketing messages isnt necessarily recommended since it can lead to broken trust or reduced relevance retail marketers should keep in mind that they should probably re establish trust and permission if longer than one months time has passed between marketing messages
2316978 re mailing with the assistance of bronto software will certainly be incorporated into our holiday email marketing campaigns for 2008
2316979 it allows us to exercise control over the factors that lead to email messages not being opened and to hit our customers with the right message at the right time
2316980 the throughput capabilities to be provided by superspeed usb are just tremendous and while the consumers experience will involve fantastically faster data transfers and exciting new applications for usb developers challenges will relate to the new underlying data bus and system architectures as well as various usb protocol changes that will make these performance improvements possible
2316981 the ellisys superspeed usb explorer will be a major enabler for developers seeking to streamline development schedules and deliver robust superspeed usb systems and devices to the consumer marketplace
2316982 ellisys has been a long time leader in providing solutions for supported standards
2316983 we are pleased to see their early support for superspeed usb which will enable quality of service and bring product to market quickly

2316990 tim burton me hubise matado si no lo hubiese hecho no me negu porque l es un fan de terminator he estado en grandes pel culas antes como en el planeta de los simios el club de la pelea charlie y la f brica de chocolates y en sweeney todd que fue muy grande pero nunca he estado en este tipo de grandes pel culas de acci n
2316991 we have worked long and hard to get where we are today and being recognized as one of the best with this nomination from me one of the most respected publications in our industry is quite an achievement for us
2316992 good solid planning and a strong foundation on which to build upon are what have positioned us for sustainability of our current growth rate into the foreseeable future we are a value and growth orientated company our premise remains constant we continue to position our core services for growth while streamlining processes to improve profit margins reduce costs and build shareholder value our customized support service platforms marketing campaigns billing methods and professional relationships enhance the availability of our service offerings and are aligned to address the current and future needs of our clients
2316993 i am pleased with where we are and very pleased with how we got here
2316994 the long range plan is to continue adapting leading technologies to develop under performing markets we have made significant progress toward this plan since our inception and believe this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of financial success for our efforts
2316995 hanfengs exceptional performance for the first half of 2008 demonstrates our ability to profitably expand our operations
2316996 in addition to the organic growth in our existing production base we successfully completed and put into commercial operations our first joint venture project in china entered into two new joint ventures that will expand our reach in china and internationally secured stable low cost sources for raw materials and began to build the framework for our distribution network these milestones provide hanfeng the vertical structure to begin to maximize our current operations and prepare us for our next phase of growth
2316997 this line was a necessity especially for the urban styled young adults
2316998 the students of today like flash eye dazzling jewelry and that is exactly what we created for them we also wanted to bring these students a message all of our class jewelry was made in honor of benjamin banneker an african american clock maker surveyor astronomer and early civil rights activist who made the first entirely wooden clock among many other accomplishments
2316999 one thing we never thought of until the problem appeared was what happens to the students who have worked hard and have made it to graduation but cannot afford to buy their class jewelry they get nothing for these students there is no reward and no way to proudly tell the world about their accomplishments
2317000 right now we are putting together a team of people dedicated to this cause we will be going to some of the largest corporations in america and asking them to sponsor students who have made it to the top in spite of having little to no money we want these students to enjoy their success by wearing their own graduating class jewelry banneker inc will also sponsor as many of these young adults as possible
2317001 the first quarter showed the inherent stability of our business model we had a loss on acquired customers in texas and lower customer additions than we would have liked despite this distributable cash was up 13 year over year with net income up 32 and distributions up 11 this is consistent with the double digit growth our unitholders have seen in the past
2317002 it is important to note that the number of texas load following customers will be much lower in coming quarters and volume additions have been stronger both in june and to date in the second quarter improvement in these areas should let the true potential of energy savings show in future quarters our industry is entering a consolidation phase energy savings will be active in reviewing and potentially acquiring smaller competitors these acquisitions will be accretive to distributable cash and will maintain our position as a market leader in the sale of deregulated gas and electricity across north america
2317003 as a unitholder i know that these investment markets can be trying higher profits and solid operating performance have had little positive effect on unit values on the tsx even higher distributions are met with skepticism all i can promise is that your management team will work very hard to maintain and improve operations we are in a growth industry and while we are not immune to general economic woes we can continue to grow and to do so profitably in the meantime we will pay a regular monthly distribution as clear evidence of the solid base we have built long term the continued building on our strengths will draw the attention of the market energy savings has been and remains a true success story
2317004 i am pleased to announce the appointment of two new members of our board of directors ken hartwick our ceo and ron joyce ken joined energy savings four and a half years ago coming from hydro one where he was cfo he has been our cfo president and now ceo and has guided a substantial improvement in our back office efficiency ron is well known across north america for his work building the very successful tim hortons business and is one of our largest unitholders energy savings will benefit from his knowledge and experience as we plan similar growth in coming years
2317005 sales and gross margin seasonally adjusted on page 8 general and administrative marketing and bad debt expenses are further clarified on page 14 and an interest expense discussion can be found on page 15

2317007 but arent you just warning the birds that youre here
2317008 yes but theyre too stupid to remember next time i hide under the bushes theyll forget this is my garden
2317009 when you go for a bird what are your actual chances of catching one
2317010 oh about the same as the chance of a non resident parent avoiding paying child support
2317011 you have to kill 16 birds a year to retain your hunting licence
2317012 ive got another ten to catch before the end of october
2317013 more children than ever before are benefiting from child maintenance
2317014 will make it comparable to the best performing child support agencies around the world
2317015 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants off shore drilling
2317016 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
2317017 we can do limited off shore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
2317018 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
2317019 the development of a battery package that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
2317020 like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
2317021 i think paris hiltons ad will turn out to be the most memorable of the campaign
2317022 mccain clearly underestimated the power of a bikini clad blonde bombshell with lots of money and even more time on her hands to hit back and let america know whats up thats hot

2317028 canadian natural has achieved a significant milestone as we proceed with the final construction commissioning and staged start up of the horizon project and begin to realize the benefits of the largest single capital project in canadian naturals history the start up of the horizon project is a major step for canadian natural we continue to evolve and diversify our asset base and look forward to the continuous stream of cash flow for years to come the result is a stronger and more sustainable company

2317032 this is how we imagine modern road motoring to be where the advantages of modern springing and the resultant driving comfort are combined with the adhesion of an equally modern low and handy sports car

2317034 ill be throwing in a week ill probably throw the beginning of next week
2317035 it would have been different if i wasnt still throwing 99 mph it was a different feeling that i never had so i just wanted to make sure
2317036 the fact that the activities i had yesterday and the way the knee responded today honestly i do feel positive in the sense that were progressing forward
2317037 i dont need any extra motivation my motivation is to win
2317038 im very proud of my area around the plate i dont want anyone messing with my dirt
2317039 its a yankee world were just falling apart in it
2317040 i think it is too little too late for the yankees to make the playoffs
2317041 i didnt know everybody was supposed to know especially when it wasnt a done deal and it wouldnt go down
2317042 its kind of between myself and my agent and boston and the padres
2317043 i dont think really anything needs to be said other than i made a commitment to play for this team for three or four years and at the end thats where i still stand
2317044 i signed a three possibly four year deal here im committed to fulfill that contract if next year doesnt work out with the option ill be a free agent and i can choose where i go
2317045 the number of accounts in arrears has reduced since march 31
2317046 the percentage of accounts in arrears remains at similar levels
2317047 the performance of the buy to let book continues to be exemplary and landlords are benefiting from increased rents and yields in the current environment as house purchases have slowed
2317048 credit market conditions continue to constrain new lending activity since the half year first mortgage activity has in the main been limited to further advances to existing landlords
2317049 the match funded portfolio continues to be cash generative with the result that free cash balances at 30 june were higher than at 31 march
2317050 the group remains financially strong and well positioned to manage its portfolio and business activities in the deteriorating economic environment

2317052 8 8 8 is very lucky and wealthy for chinese
2317053 my country club number is 88 and i have two 8s in my phone 0 8 0 8 but then again im not superstitious
2317054 i never put them on probably for one reason they wouldnt last 8 seconds after the first chinese person saw them
2317055 the olympics make chinese everybody feel real proud of it and really happy
2317056 they werent nervous they suck plain and simple who found this interesting
2317057 through this we hope to make more people aware of the situation inside tibet china and burma and hopefully people with good consciences will join us and put pressure on the government
2317058 and with pressure from the international community we hope the chinese government will produce some tangible results right now all of the media is focused on the opening ceremonies its supposed to be the biggest ceremonies ever so were doing this to show people that china is not as glorious as they claim to be its a totally different picture in tibet
2317059 we are here to let people know that we are fed up with the continuation of human rights abuses in china
2317060 right now in tibet we have one of the worst crackdowns one of the most repressive times since the cultural revolution
2317061 thousands of monks have been locked up in their monasteries or taken away to other parts until the beijing games are over
2317062 we were able to determine that the aircraft came into the trees next to the river at a very steep angle
2317063 on examination of the wreckage its damage is consistent with the aircraft not being in control just before impact
2317064 we know there was a mechanical problem because of the loss of control but it was not a problem thats associated with ongoing maintenance or design
2317065 the aircraft was damaged by equipment thats not normally on the aircraft when its in flight
2317066 well likely get a propeller expert to join us in the disassembly of the propeller hubs and from there well determine whether we need to go into the engines
2317067 we have good information on what occurred in the operation of the aircraft but we always have to ensure that the mechanics as we are able to determine were functioning properly we dont suspect the engines but we have to do that anyway
2317068 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2317069 canada has sought assurances that mr khadr under our government will be treated humanely
2317070 its yet another attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid trial
2317071 now we know that the canadian government has known about facilitated and helped cover up the torture and abuse of a canadian citizen
2317072 this is no longer just a matter of government policy
2317073 whatever was afoot he did not know what anybody elses plans were or might have been
2317074 he was saying from his heart that he didnt know of any plans to attack canada he said that repeatedly he said that sincerely and he said that quite credibly
2317075 these guys were like religious people i dont think they were like planning to do something against canada
2317076 we just cant be 10th in the country for salaries and expect we would get the best people
2317077 i recognize that in being the top decision makers they do have increased salaries what we have to do is make sure people who are responsible for budgets are the best we can possibly have from across the country or from within the civil service
2317078 we cant give people a minimum wage increase havent had one since 2001 the government fights that tooth and nail yet the premiers top deputy can get a 105 000 pay increase
2317079 thats a gold medal in arrogance if there ever was one
2317080 to give 35 per cent and 43 per cent increases to people who are already making 10 times what the average person makes in this province is an insult to everybody who pays a penny of taxes
2317081 and secondly theyve frozen the minimum wage going on eight years
2317082 products that claim to be eco friendly but do not list all their ingredients or which use generic terms like anionic surfactant cannot be adequately evaluated for their effect on human health or the environment
2317083 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2317084 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2317085 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2317086 if its good enough for seth godin its good enough for me
2317087 why have i decided to do this there are a few reasons

2317090 to sit here and not sign it and postpone this is just poor management this is a project that would take thousands of people off the road
2317091 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2317092 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2317093 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2317094 weve got good ideas but we have no idea whats best so lets create a letter thats good enough and test it to see what happens

2317117 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2317118 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2317119 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2317120 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2317121 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm

2317124 what if no one comes in we have all this great stuff
2317125 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2317126 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2317127 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2317128 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2317129 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2317130 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2317131 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2317132 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2317133 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2317134 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2317135 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2317136 im going to shoulder this remorse and guilt for the rest of my life
2317137 this is an open military aggression and we are now at the state of undeclared war with russia what else could you call it
2317138 i like the idea of the next president of the united states senator barack obama campaigning hand in hand with the next governor of the state of missouri jay nixon
2317139 but we dont celebrate because this victory was unexpected we celebrate because were turning the page and were one step closer to victory tonight we stand united
2317140 we can either continue moving backwards with these same failed policies or we can chart a new course and begin to move forward again
2317141 we cant afford four more years of the same economic policies
2317142 we cant afford four more years of skyrocketing health care costs and soaring college tuition we cant afford four more years of losing good paying jobs to other states and other countries
2317143 we cant afford four more years where science and research take a back seat to ideology we cant afford four more years where the special interests have special access and regular folks just get squeezed we need change
2317144 who could blame them our state has lost nearly 17 000 jobs since october there are 750 000 missourians who dont have health care coverage including one out of 11 children if youre fortunate to have coverage it costs way too much gas prices are skyrocketing and a college education is moving out of reach for more and more missouri families
2317145 i want to tell people about the situation im here as an athlete to be an ambassador of my country but i am a member of team darfur i was in that situation
2317146 but i said i want to be as fast as that guy thats what inspired me from that point on it was so great to see running with people cheering running is what we do all our lives its part of our transportation
2317147 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
2317148 our decision was not intended to insult the beijing organizing committee or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality
2317149 regarding brian he recently resigned to form a startup technology company outside the game industry
2317150 this change wont impact the game were really pleased with the look and feel that brian helped create for diablo iii and the new person we bring onboard will work with the other artists on the team to maintain the art style moving forward
2317151 we chose this art style its too late to fix it even if we wanted too sorry to anyone that doesnt like it
2317152 yes yes it does and unless im color blind or something i dont see any
2317153 mid 1990s when pcs in general couldnt handle hundreds of thousands of colors on screen at any kind of playable speed in an action game
2317154 realistic armory and weaponry without over sized and exaggerated proportions like big shoulder guards have they ever played diablo
2317155 game looks awesome and will be a good excuse beside sc2 to upgrade my computer
2317156 we thought he was just talking when he made the threats against our father
2317157 simply because it is the world language and a lot of american and british people live here or come over here for their holidays
2317158 this is not a job fair where people will work at minimum wage this is a career fair

2317163 seems like there should be a yield sign for the traffic merging onto westbound i 470
2317164 the reason there is no yield sign for motorists from u s 50 to i 470 westbound is due to the additional lane that begins at this point
2317165 i 470 goes from two lanes to three lanes beginning at the ramp thus motorists leaving u s 50 and entering i 470 westbound have their own lane traffic on i 470 that wants to exit to u s 50 eastbound must merge with entering traffic in order to exit onto u s 50 what may make this situation unique from other cloverleaf type interchanges is the addition of a lane on i 470 westbound
2317166 use the ramp and acceleration lane to increase your speed to match the speed of the vehicles on the highway as you are speeding up watch for an opening in the highway traffic switch on your turn signal and pull smoothly into the traffic do not stop at the end of an acceleration lane unless traffic is very heavy and you have to stop
2317167 drivers already on the highway should give you room to enter but if they dont do not force your way onto the highway
2317168 use the deceleration lane and the exit ramp to slow down be sure you obey the speed limit sign on the exit ramp be ready to stop or yield at the end of the ramp

2317227 i wo uldnt like it being run by the private sector with it being council owned we the councillors and the people have some say in how it operates if the private sector got a hold of it it would be near impossible to control what goes on there

2317257 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
2317258 the fighting is more serious than weve seen for some time
2317259 how serious its going to get is unclear while there are hundreds of breaches of the ceasefire every year whats happened over the past few days is of a completely different order
2317260 the military assistance rendered to the separatists criminal regime by the russian federation in violation of all agreements cannot be assessed in any other way than as another act of aggression against georgia
2317261 we urge the georgian leadership to show common sense and stop irresponsible military activities in south ossetia
2317262 we view the situation as extremely dangerous it has indeed reached a stage of unprecedented drama
2317263 russian armored vehicles have entered the northern suburbs of tskhinvali
2317264 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia
2317265 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armored vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back
2317266 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity and we call for an immediate ceasefire

2317289 the bug has completely gone but id not been able to train and the effects of this became evident in the first of the days two finals after about 12 laps i felt very hot and thought wow ive got 24 more laps of this in the main final
2317290 im not sure what happened because in the warm up id been inside the top 5 i went out with new rubber tyres on the kart and went slower i shouldve easily been in the top twenty but was back in the midfield
2317291 i did quite well in the heats thanks to a few moses starts where the field just seems to part in front of you
2317292 as the race wore on i realised i wasnt feeling too good
2317293 i was losing places and began driving to conserve my energy for the main final i thought if i can recover in time ill be fine

2317295 against a difficult overall enviroment we made significant progress in respect to removing costs while creating a more streamlined and efficient infrastructure the steps we have taken should enable us to capture future growth and better position us for profitability our operating expenses declined by more than 3 7 million year over year we expect additional benefits in the quarters to come we have also now begun implementing the next phase of cost reductions with an eye on making our organization even more efficient and sustainable while mitigating the risk to our ability to grow the top line
2317296 we have reduced our negative cash flow before working capital and capital expenditures by more than 50 from the first quarter of 2008
2317297 despite the current market challenges we are highly focused on the goal of achieving break even before working capital and capital expenditures by the end of this year we believe this will give us additional flexibility with respect to our capital structure and the many revenue opportunities before us we are prepared to use every rational cost reduction tool to achieve break even
2317298 although it is not yet clearly reflected in our top line results we believe that we are making very important progress our leads business performed reasonably well in a difficult market in q2 for the short term we expect the market difficulty to continue vehicle purchase decisionsare being delayed and this is leading to a lower number of leads available in the marketplace no one knows how long this negative pressure will continue but we still firmly believe that our leads business can grow and become profitable in the long term
2317299 our advertising revenues have been very disappointing as we have taken difficult but necessary steps to rebuild this revenue stream while traffic decreased significantly during q2 our traffic generation marketing was much more effective in addition we expect to gain traffic and advertising revenue through new advertising streams that include syndicated content co branding myride com local dealer advertising and our autoreach ad network

2317310 since signing on the dotted line with our initial seven investor groups in september of last year weve had our sights set on adding an eighth team to the league
2317311 in philadelphia we have the perfect foundation for success combining a strong operating group with the citys recent acquisition of an mls team to create a prime market for womens soccer
2317312 yet even with philadelphia beginning play in 2010 we havent ruled out the possibility of having an eighth wps team play in the 2009 inaugural season
2317313 the league is exploring a number of solid expansion opportunities in other cities with the intention of adding another team by years end
2317314 wps is poised to be the premier womens soccer league in the world and im honored to be a part of the movement
2317315 even more so im proud to give local fans access to the highest caliber of womens play and help put philadelphia on the map when it comes to professional soccer
2317316 i see a tremendous opportunity to reap a large return from my investment by getting in from the beginning the timing is right for the boom in womens professional soccer in the delaware valley region
2317317 this is an exciting time to be a fan of professional soccer in philadelphia
2317318 if the response to the arrival of wps is anything like what weve been receiving then the new womens team will do very well in philadelphia we look forward to identifying ways in which we can partner with wps to further elevate professional soccer in this region
2317319 a number of cities have expressed interest in hosting a wps team and philadelphia in particular is a hotbed of soccer talent and enthusiasm soccer fans have made it clear that they want a womens team in philly to complement the new mls team
2317320 matts experience with minor league professional teams and youth soccer will serve him well in developing the wps teams brand identity and driving ticket sales were honored and excited to welcome him to the wps family
2317321 weve said all along that wps will be a league built on long term growth and stability and expansion into philadelphia is simply reflective of that strategy
2317322 with such strong leadership and an enthusiastic core fan base the philadelphia wps team will no doubt be a successful venture on its own while simultaneously contributing to the overall awareness and popularity of womens soccer in north america

2317326 twenty two percent of their beds are vacant right now and theyre proposing to build a bunch of new units run by the state thats crazy
2317327 first of all what do i mean by the term geospatial intelligence for me it is the melding of geospatial information that of data and products across the spectrum of the ologies and ographies with the intelligence disciplines to deliver a capability greater than the sum of the constituent parts a means of visualising the instance situation or forecasting the same
2317328 simplified it is all about situational awareness via a recognised environmental picture but it is also more than that geospatial intelligence provides the foundation for the jop joint operations picture or the cop common operating picture it is not just geographic information
2317329 in the us this is increasingly referred to as human terrain the mapping of the social cultural and temporal aspects of a society this causes a demand for more non traditional data for use in geospatial analysis leading to the routing of convoys to avoid schools and mosques for example

2317343 ich bedauere dass es berhaupt soweit gekommen ist und hoffe dass auf der n chsten ebene eine einvernehmliche l sung erreicht wird
2317344 das w rde nur als kurswechsel und abkehr vom agendakurs interpretiert werden
2317345 es ist v lliger unfug in diese diskussion eine angebliche inhaltliche zerrissenheit der spd hineinzumengen die gibt es nicht
2317346 es geht nicht um politische berzeugungen oder meinungen sondern um verhalten
2317347 jeder darf seine meinung sagen aber kein spd mitglied hat das recht von der wahl seiner eigenen partei abzuraten

2317380 that should have been my first warning when you first said ill give you a softball question like theres going to be a hardball but what
2317381 i know who you are i know exactly what you do

2317383 bat segundo is clearly a nutcase i would advise anyone against paying him any credence
2317384 what could quite possibly be the coolest radio show in the history of ever
2317385 i cannot believe she would question the importance of the bat segundo show
2317386 really a matt segundo who is vamping it up with a vampire accent
2317387 an interweb sideshow of great distinction and absolutely spiffing podcasts
2317388 a terrific literary podcast that boasts some absolutely stellar author interviews
2317389 he loved animals and music the song dirty old town was sang at his funeral
2317390 he was a very kind decent man and was very gentle behind it all
2317391 i havent seen the conflict there if there is one there it escapes me
2317392 lets make a health care system that aids people not insurance companies
2317393 children were encouraged to sit down and adults were asked to move back so that as many as possible would have a good view of the shows but they refused and our people were abused
2317394 we must keep our cities and gardens as clean as our homes

2317400 these are baby steps in the direction of a recovery
2317401 these are tentative signs of recovery well need several quarters of data to see a trend the good news however is that the company has slowed its fall
2317402 essentially the companys supply chain from research and development to sales and marketing remains chaotic and the timeline for the handset spin off is definitely not fast enough theres a lack of urgency
2317403 at the same time we are seeing a stronger than expected demand for gsm w cdma mobile access in emerging markets especially in asia in addition we feel positive about our prospects in china both in 2g and 3g including cdma ev do for the fourth quarter and next year finally we now see a stronger than initially expected demand in services especially in network operations and network integration against this mixed backdrop we continue to anticipate that the global telecommunications equipment and related services market should be flat in 2008 at constant currency
2317404 waterford is heavily reliant on manufacturing and has already seen temporary staff laid off at honeywell as well as job losses at other companies like waterford crystal
2317405 in spite of having a government minister waterford and the south east have been overlooked in terms of highquality new jobs for the region
2317406 the government has failed to attract these hightech jobs that are essential to future economic growth has ignored calls to grant university status to waterford institute of technology and has failed to set up a national upskilling strategy to ensure that irish firms and employees can continue to compete internationally
2317407 the workers have given a lot and built up a solid reputation within the company worldwide
2317408 these efforts need to be rewarded by significant investment in the company and a commitment by the management to minimise losses in the waterford plant i also call on the minister for trade and enterprise mich al martin to intervene and do what he can to make this happen the government must pull out all the stops and ensure that we keep as many jobs as possible in waterford
2317409 these allegations have been made previously in january ro timi refuted them at the time and that is to be believed until there is evidence to the contrary if not he should perhaps consid er legal action the ball is in his court he has an sw ered the allegations an d this is just a scurrilous act
2317410 ro timi has been a very good ambassador to the county he has represented laois all over the world and has carried himself with dignity im shocked that this video has been posted
2317411 he has served very well as mayor and i feel without seeing the video i cannot comment
2317412 the immigration authorities would have vetted rotimi very ca re fully he ha s also made a considerable contribution to laois and to the countys et hnic minorities
2317413 imagine a saturday afternoon and a guy going stupidly to the supermarket to buy a useless gadget
2317414 he sees a really sexy object oh my god its beautiful how much does it cost five hundred euros thats almost what id spend on a useless gadget he brings the windmill home goes to his roof and 15 minutes later he sees it turning and producing energy wow
2317415 this will take me to 55 if both parties want to continue which hopefully will happen
2317416 i like to think ill still want to keep coaching when i get to 55 but if we continue to do our job this will get us close
2317417 but im looking at it as 10 one year contracts
2317418 thrilled that bill will be our coach for years to come
2317419 he has done a tremendous job leading the kansas mens basketball program both on and off the court theres no one id rather have at the helm of the kansas program
2317420 cannot imagine a better place to play or to coach than the university of kansas my family and i look forward to being part of the kansas and lawrence communities for many years to come
2317421 the entire process was positive from day one we didnt squabble over anything there was never a question we would get this worked out its nice to know were going to have our coach for a long period of time
2317422 when we first sat down to talk lew asked me how many years do you want
2317423 there was no negotiating on my part either i cant think of any place id rather work or live
2317424 bills only 45 in 10 years hell still be a young man of 55
2317425 but we feel very good about where we are and where were going
2317426 im looking at it that we have some momentum off last year and we need to build on it
2317427 we want to put ourselves in the championship game again as soon as we can but getting the security is definitely a nice thing our coaches and i are very happy about the commitment the university has made to us we want to make a similar commitment back

2317432 it will offset nearly 24 billion pounds of carbon dioxide that would have otherwise been released into our atmosphere if produced by traditional means
2317433 our ecotours emphasise rare wildlife viewing and nature education with our life time commitment to and knowledge of conservation and education we will be providing quality experiences and education we believe there is something in these walks for everyone to take away and little bit of new knowledge of our coastline and tramore

2317436 estimate of the combined state local tax burden shouldered by the residents of each of the 50 states
2317437 for each state we calculate the total amount paid by the residents in taxes and we divide those taxes by the total income in each state to compute a
2317438 we make this calculation not only for the most recent year but also for earlier years because tax and income data are revised periodically by government agencies and in the case of the current report we have changed our own methodology to take advantage of new datasets
2317439 the goal is to focus not on the tax collectors but on the taxpayers that is we answer the question what percentage of their income are the residents of this state paying in state and local taxes we are not trying to answer the question how much money have state and local governments collected the census bureau publishes the definitive comparative data answering that question
2317440 the true measure of the tax burden in any state must include the taxes paid by residents to other states
2317441 now it appears all 829 residents of canton kansas are angry at me
2317442 unfortunately its not unusual within that particular area to have such a low voter turnout now ill give you to have zero voter turnout is highly unusual

2317464 he had already made arrangements and it has nothing to do with martin cullen it wasnt appropriate to bring him into the middle of it
2317465 it is important and appropriate that john attends the games
2317466 we fund the olympic council and the athletes attending the games however they will only give accreditation to heads of state and government ministers
2317467 the international olympic committee issues accreditation in limited numbers we give them to athletes team members and the government in the past government accreditations have been given to john treacy
2317468 but i think for instance tony hillermans work mystery novels set around reservations should be classified as what it is colonial literature i think theres an arrogance amongst white americans about their relationship to the oppressed people that prevents them from seeing themselves as coming from a position of privilege

2317472 pero el hecho es que el gobierno al igual que con el salvamento de la reserva federal al banco bear stearns ayuda a empresas que no han hecho un buen trabajo

2317499 helicopter crash subway fire water main break ice storm heat wave blackout
2317500 m y sense is that just the velocity of the plane and the fact that you have a plane filled with fuel hitting that building that burned that the velocity of the plane certainly had an impact on the structure itself and then the fact that it burned and you had that intense heat probably weakened the structure as well and i think it was simply the planes hitting the buildings and causing the collapse
2317501 im not sure i agree that this is necessarily state sponsored it certainly has the fingerprints of somebody like bin laden

2317543 it seems far too convenient for the department the way the report the worked out
2317544 we would hope to engage with the department in the future and this report could be a foundation stone and template for negotiations
2317545 at the end of the day my take home pay is actually less than the pharmacists i employ i dont know how these cuts can be made without them been very serious
2317546 to speak of god in this sense is not only error and without meaning it is sin in his interpretation of genesis luther made it very clear that adams sin was not really the act of eating the forbidden fruit by which he disobeyed the command his sin was that he raised the question ought god to have said he began to argue about god disputare de deo and so set himself outside of god and made gods claim upon men a debatable question if we try to evade this condemnation by saying such discussion may not have intended any ill it could on the contrary arise from intellectual honesty from the longing for god then we should merely have demonstrated once more that we have not comprehended the concept of god we should have fallen into the old error and should again have represented the omnipotence of god and the determination of ourselves by it as a fact to be accepted as a universal truth like the dependence of every earthly object on the law of causality but then we should have wholly failed to comprehend what the determination of our existence by god means for that determination also involves the claim of god on us consequently every setting of ourselves outside go would be a denial of gods claim on us it would therefore by atheism and would be sin a different conclusion would be possible only if neutrality in relation to god were a possibility but to assume such a position of neutrality is to abandon the idea of god adam thought he could flee from before god but gods claim is not annulled by flight consequently speaking about god becomes sin and sin it remains even when it arises from a sincere quest for god it is therefore evident that it we are in a situation which requires that we honestly argue about god we are sinners and of ourselves can do nothing to escape from sin it would not help us at all if because of a correct understanding of the idea of god we determined to stop argument about god disputare de deo for to speak otherwise of god and that would mean to speak from god is obviously nothing we can undertake of ourselves as our undertaking that would again be sin because it would be merely an undertaking of ours in which the thought of gods omnipotent rule would be abandoned speaking of god as from god can evidently be only the gift of god himself
2317547 make such huge contribution in a voluntary capacity to the provision and improvement of sports facilities throughout the county

2317575 there was already a law in place in illinois that said that you always have to supply life saving treatment to any infant under any circumstances

2317577 if were placing a burden on the doctor that says you have to keep alive even a previable child as long as possible and give them as much medical attention as as is necessary to try and keep that child alive then were probably crossing the line in terms of unconstitutionality

2317665 do not give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before swine
2317666 its a different system than people have seen the last couple years
2317667 the whole idea of it is to give us the best chance to win we want to get to the point where we have an established running game and if we need to we can throw the ball to win games in the fourth quarter
2317668 in terms of receivers running backs and the whole scheme of things its going to be a lot like 05
2317669 im thinking people will notice the difference in our offense
2317670 we have so much talent what coach paterno and the offensive staff are trying to do is get everybody to touch the ball and give you an opportunity to make a play we have so many weapons and so many ways to get the ball into the end zone its exciting theres definitely a lot more opportunities than before
2317671 daryll can do a lot of things he reminds me a lot of michael robinson daryll has a good arm and great running ability both quarterbacks can pass and run and that will allow us to do so much more

2317675 this is just great mom monday i get rubber bands in my mouth tuesday i have to lay in a tunnel for 1 2 an hour and today i get wires glued to my head and a man purse to carry it all around in
2317676 we look forward to welcoming the waterford hurlers back to tramore
2317677 last years deise evening was a great success with the hurlers and jockeys involved in plenty of antics in the parade ring and marquee it really was an evening that we will all remember we have put a lot of work in to the entertainment programme for this years festival and the hurlers will certainly get us off to a lively start on the first evening
2317678 i started the waterford in october 1997 really because of where i was living which is in a beautiful valley i felt there was a demand for somewhere for locals and tourists to stop and have lunch or a drink after exploring all the attractions in the area
2317679 i compared it to harneys in dunhill which i always liked to call into if i was out in annestown or visiting my sisters in dunhill the best thing i ever did was to call it the waterford as a lot of new zealanders made the connection with waterford crystal as they had visited it on their overseas trips im now into my 11th year i meet people from all over the world i must admit though its great when someone from your home town walks in its great to hear someone with the same accent as yourself
2317680 like a lot of other teenagers at the time i took my chances at different jobs around waterford mcinerneys the railways in sally park clover meats siekmans on the estate milton bradley now called hasbro
2317681 i got here got a job with a contractor laying drainage pipes which was a big shock to the system i lasted about a month and then got a job with glaxo pharmaceuticals i was with them for 13 years until i was made redundant in 1996
2317682 after 10 years in the industry ive decided to sell up and pursue my other interests of hunting and fishing anyone who has been to new zealand will understand it is a hunters and fishermans paradise
2317683 i keep in touch with whats going on in waterford by reading the local papers including the waterford news amp star every wednesday online
2317684 its a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now
2317685 the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus
2317686 in todays economy fiscal prudence and responsibility call for tax reduction even if it temporarily enlarges the federal deficit why reducing taxes is the best way open to us to increase revenues
2317687 laois have gone from being the best in the province to barely one of the best five and that will have to be reversed
2317688 im going out there to carlton on a trial basis
2317689 i was supposed to be going over on saturday but i have delayed it because of the stradbally game i think i will be going over after that
2317690 i was just preparing for the second half and my umpires were just walking back up the field it was my own fault because i just threw the ball in a bit early and i got barely clipped
2317691 shall enter a management and maintenance agreement with an approved person and submit a copy of the agree ment and subsequent renewals to the local authority for approval
2317692 its another way of putting a stealth tax on people who are already maintaining septic tanks i cant support these by laws with that paragraph in it how many people would this affect all its doing is putting more inspectors in there inspecting inspectors
2317693 i dont like section 6 septic tanks and waste water treatment systems shall be inspected by an approved person at least every four years after initial inspection for structural soundness water tightness of the treatment system and for visible signs of malfunction its pretty draconian if this criteria is accepted very few tanks will pass it itll cause huge problems in rural areas ive seen abandoned cars and barrels off cement mixers being used as septic tanks
2317694 its going to affect planning permissions in certain areas im not very happy about these and i can see problems down the line
2317695 we always had fairly good inspectors now on top of that well have county council inspectors these bylaws should go back to the spc environment and water services strategic policy committee before being fully formulated
2317696 most rural councillors have concerns on this but its very unlikely changes will be made to them during the spc discussions its another hit for people living in rural areas
2317697 many of the councillors are very concerned even before this goes out for public consultation and on display the spc should look at it again and make amendments to it as they see fit they should amend it to make it practicable and reasonable for people out there if the government or the eu wants people to eliminate septic tanks they have to provide them with the resources to do so
2317698 its very important we get this right we dont need over regulation on septic tanks but we have to ensure we protect the groundwater id like to see the promotion of reed beds its a cheap and reasonable solution
2317699 i propose this goes back to the spc id be surprised if no changes were made to it after serious reservations were made here as they stand theyll have serious reservations for people in the country areas
2317700 our room for making amendments to this is minimal its coming from the department of the environment and the environment protection agency epa we may make minimal changes but the document will stay the same
2317701 they wont come into force if we dont adopt them
2317702 laois is a rural county and very dependent on ground water sources which we have to protect whether you like it or not the water services act is in place where there are septic tanks they have to be operated properly
2317703 the epa is starting to come down like a ton of bricks on us for monitoring where the funding will come from for inspectors thatll have to be looked at we dont want a situation as what happened in galway last year cryptosporidium outbreak
2317704 the epa has been on to us in a big way for our water plan
2317705 theres so many things in this that are wrong look at 5 4 bylaws setting out intervals when septic tanks should be cleaned out i know where theres septic tanks functioning for 40 years or more where the sewerage has never been removed if operated properly they need little clearing out dont start picking on the poor man that has a septic tank
2317706 if we go only with all these rules from the department of the environment well do nothing
2317707 its amazing its really good i missed the last one we won and its just a great feeling its brilliant
2317708 to be honest with you the last few years we were probably afraid of going up senior but this year i think weve got a really good team weve got some young players like chloe ryan and jane moore and theyre flying and theyre under 14 were looking forward to going up against park and at least theres a few teams now at our level and it makes it a bit easier
2317709 i think it does and i think that there should be more work put into intermediate and there should be more matches given its hard to build on it but definitely intermediates a great level and it prepares you then for senior
2317710 i was happy enough i think every one played brilliant everyone made such an effort when we played r and c gaels everyone put such a big effort in and today we just went out again the same and we kicked points like weve never kicked them so its great
2317711 ive been running into brick walls since i got here
2317712 i just want to be able to give my father a proper burial but i dont have money to bury my father
2317713 they asked me would i be interested and i said yes
2317714 we are in a gridlock in the senate today on judges
2317715 the party with the president gets three and the other party gets one
2317716 if mccains the president well just send the same letter in
2317717 for most black americans obamas candidacy represented a kind of racial milestone the natural next phase of a 50 year movement
2317718 but for michael nutter the reverse was also true not supporting obamas candidacy marked a kind of progress too
2317719 it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep
2317720 i may be scrawny but im wiry like the devil

2317725 that great principle of undulation in nature that shows itself in the inspiring and expiring of the breath in desire and satiety in the ebb and flow of the sea in day and night in heat and cold and as yet more deeply ingratified in every atom and every fluid is known to us under the name of polarity these fits of easy transmission and reflection as newton called them are the law of nature because they are the law of spirit

2317728 we are educated in ideology but we are born into doxa
2317729 habitus the concept of habit or habitus is used by bourdieu to refer to daily practices of individuals groups societies and nations
2317730 that the ideology of advanced industrial society produces false needs false consciousness and one dimensional mass consciousness outlines categories such as liberation technology culture and democracy as dialectical ones dialectic of liberation liberation from the existing false society could be achieved because the material conditions have reached a level where an immediate jump into the realm of freedom would be possible but ideological manipulations forestall radical social change
2317731 ironically there are two modernistic yet sociological grounds that habermas fails to incorporate or appreciate in his analysis gender and racial inequality
2317732 history is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake
2317733 surprising discoveries in the 1980s have begun to tell us how an embryo develops into a mature animal and these discoveries have radically altered our views of evolution and of the relation of human beings to all other animals
2317734 organisms and societies are multi leveled hierarchies of semi autonomous sub wholes branching into sub wholes into sub wholes of a lower order and so on the term holon has been introduced to refer to these intermediary entities which relative to their subordinates in the hierarchy functions as self contained wholes relative to their superordinates as dependent parts hierarchies are dissectible into their constituent branches on which holons forms their nodes the number of levels which a hierarchy comprises is called its depth and the number of holons its span holons are governed by fixed sets of rules and display more or less flexible strategies the rules and conduct of a social holon are not reducible to the rules of conduct of its member consciousness appears as an emergent quality in phylogeny and ontogeny which from primitive beginnings evolves towards more complex and precise states it is the highest manifestation of the integrative tendency to extract order out of disorder and information out of noise phylogeny and ontogeny are developmental hierarchies in which the tree branches along the axis of time the different levels represent different stages of development and the holons reflect intermediate structures
2317735 the over emphasis on space and spatiality that increases with every century since 1500 is at once the greatness as well as the weakness of perspectival man
2317736 the new structure of consciousness to which we are transitioning demands new means new processes and new methods it should be repeated that this ushering in of the new in no way indicates or dictates a discarding of what has come before far from it we must keep in mind that it is the activity and presence of the past that distinguishes gebsers approach from others supercession does not mean invalidating replacement in this context intimates an intensification rather than a nullification nevertheless the inevitability of this transition should be recognized as well this particular term best illustrates this new way of understanding eteology is then a new form of statement
2317737 what is necessary today to turn the tide of our situation are not new philosophemes like the phenomenological ontological or existential but eteologemes eteology must replace philosophy just as philosophy once replaced the myths eteology then is neither a mere ontology that is theory of being nor is it a theory of existence the dualistic question of being versus non being which is commensurate only with the mental structure is superseded by eteology together with the secularized question as to being whose content or more exactly whose vacuity is nothing more than existence
2317738 what the hell how did anyone see me there wasnt even anyone around

2317778 hes involved hes got a role in it hes done something
2317779 they should strive to have their hearings completed and the findings made public prior to july 1964 when the presidential campaigns will begin to get hot he stated it would be unfair to present the findings after july
2317780 ford indicated he would keep me thoroughly advised as to the activities of the commission
2317781 he stated this would have to be done on a confidential basis however he thought it should be done
2317782 i referred to this weeks issue of newsweek magazine which contains a rather clear analysis of the report
2317783 i told congressman ford that newsweek was owned by the washington post and that apparently some one was trying to curry favor i told him we of course did not get along very well with either the washington post or newsweek he said that he was in the same boat that he liked neither one of these publications

2317786 remember the sound of the pavement world turned upside down city streets unlined and empty not a soul around some lessons we learn the hard way
2317787 i often dont play it live because its hard to go back there i do it when im in a place that feels really comfortable
2317788 im on a patch of grass looking at the ocean with palm trees
2317789 the ghost of the front end of a vehicle its a feeling in the back of your neck
2317790 i would be lucky to find me a man who could love me the way that i am
2317791 theres never a moment when i go i want something to sound like that era its more creating without an end in sight i have a vision not a storyboard
2317792 and then i try to play it again and make charts
2317793 im like what someone needs to tell them im not celine dion
2317794 to do music at the end of the day is a total blessing and a joy
2317795 you can only really hope and pray that there isnt a talbot out there that will prey on them
2317796 i would just like to apologize to my family the victim and her family
2317797 i understand women are a cornerstone of our society and without them we wouldnt be here
2317798 that in essence is all he can do after the fact
2317799 the player allocation and draft process has been the top priority for the league office and team owners since first announcing the leagues formation last september
2317800 wps will be the ultimate showcase for the worlds best female soccer talent and for those athletes competing in the beijing olympics the next stage in their careers as a north american league our first priority is the u s womens national team players whose skills will be complemented by the worlds top players as well as the domestic players who have the talent and dedication required of professional athletes
2317801 this is an exciting time for the national team players as the olympics are right around the corner and then a few weeks after we come home from beijing well be allocated to wps teams
2317802 im eager to learn which team ill be playing for and to connect with the fans in that market
2317803 from a team roster perspective we are being very thorough in the player scouting and draft process
2317804 the end goal is to create a cohesive team ripe with talent and personality and poised to win of course
2317805 all of the wps markets have a rich soccer tradition and wps will be unique because our players will be some of the most fan accessible professional athletes in the country
2317806 thats important to our fans who will be cheering the players from the stands and avidly following them off the field as well
2317807 its been a long haul and were all eager to get the lhc research program under way
2317808 watch the disease progress in a dish that is to watch what goes right or wrong
2317809 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
2317810 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
2317811 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
2317812 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools
2317813 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2317814 producers such as venezuela could let production fall and nationalize the oil industry because there was no punishment for doing this when prices kept rising
2317815 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology
2317816 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2317817 wacky hermits organic babies are even tastier than the puppies i put in my smoothies
2317818 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2317819 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2317820 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2317821 im not selling for less that 145 and thats final

2317823 where would you go if you could go anywhere in the world for a dream vacation
2317824 i will drive into a crowd then i will use a knife after ive finished with the vehicle goodbye everyone
2317825 well i dont care even though its going to be a small scale attack i will do it even if it rains
2317826 alrededor de un tercio de la poblaci n mundial est infectada hoy en d a con el germen que causa la tuberculosis
2317827 el drama que sucede con el vih y la tuberculosis asociada a ese virus se puede ver m s v vidamente en el frica subsahariana
2317828 es actualmente considerado el agente m s potente para reactivar la tuberculosis latente
2317829 muy importante para la progresi n de nuevas infecciones de tuberculosis en las personas
2317830 ya ha demostrado ser muy exitosa para prevenir la enfermedad activa en las personas que tienen el virus latente
2317831 es una paradoja que una de las enfermedades infecciosas m s viejas y una de las m s nuevas hayan encontrado esta manera de actuar en conjunto contra los m s vulnerables
2317832 it originally came out of not really knowing how to write a song
2317833 we try to pack in as many melodies as possible and change it up a lot as opposed to a straight repetitive style
2317834 basically it all started in our senior year in high school
2317835 the blogs were abuzz with news about natalie portman shaving her head we were in class together and we had to pick a team name for a game we were playing and we chose natalie portmans shaved head we just rolled with that with our little band that was forming at the same time
2317836 theres definitely a fine line in a lot of our songs
2317837 a lot of it is quite sincere or at least comes from a genuine place
2317838 a song that sounds like the most insincere song can be the most sincere
2317839 i was trying to grow facial hair for the first time so we wrote a song about it keyboardist david prices rap about not being able to grow a beard is completely real
2317840 its kind of funny when people say were an 80s band i didnt even realize this was 80s music
2317841 its funny music hasnt really changed all that much from back then
2317842 i think people were just tired of being so serious all the time
2317843 i know i am sometimes you just want to have fun and not think about whats going on
2317844 weve had some people pass out at our shows before its kind of a competition between us and the audience
2317845 when people are dancing its the way you have a connection with the audience its like a dialogue between us and the audience the language of the dance
2317846 videanu ne a bagat paine in casa si bani in buzunare prin bordurile si autorizatiile lui emise aiurea
2317847 hemingway a scris ca viata e frumoasa si ca merita sa lupti pentru ea eu sunt de acord cu ultima parte
2317848 no no no it aint me babe it aint me youre looking for babe
2317849 we dont get out of bed in the night time and we dont go peepee or poopoo in our underwears
2317850 we really cant find peace until we know whos been caught and whos been identified
2317851 we ask those who are responsible for what happened to come forward and that all of us can move forward with our lives knowing that his death has not been in vain
2317852 we believe that a strong community helps to solve crimes and most importantly helps prevent them and reduce them
2317853 hmm i wonder what the cause for aspergers is maybe i should wikipedia it
2317854 some people say that i lost speed my sophomore year
2317855 but every year since i got here ive gotten faster
2317856 he turned it around some last year and he had a heck of a spring
2317857 he was trying too hard for a while trying to make big plays all the time
2317858 i just want to work hard and do all i can do to help the team
2317859 so im going to try to use this weapon to actually do good with it people listen to what i have to say for some reason
2317860 since 1945 countries of the world have continued to amass nuclear weapons knowing full well what horror and devastation they can bring
2317861 for children who lived in a home with a man who married underage girls or agreed to an arranged marriage of an underage daughter the safety plans include a requirement to keep the children away from that man
2317862 because the distribution of compounds found in each fingerprint can be unique we also can use this technology to pull one fingerprint out from beneath layers of other fingerprints
2317863 by looking for compounds we know to be present in a certain fingerprint we can separate it from the others and obtain a crystal clear image of that fingerprint
2317864 that introduced huge amounts of radioactive carbon into the atmosphere and subsequently us
2317865 well its not working tonight and probably wont lets try something else and leave it until next week
2317866 how kb is going to wreck the game this week and then spend his entire radio career trying to justify it
2317867 we anticipate continued strong demand for our products and services that help farmers around the world improve both crop quality and yield specifically the outlook for the second half of the year remains solid with corn wheat and soybean prices at two to three times historic levels this should support crop input demand and continued strength in the nutrient markets benefiting our retail wholesale and advanced technologies businesses
2317868 a home should establish a mood and a feeling like a stage set does
2317869 the warm yellow undercoat united them into a warm harmonic palette
2317870 walls should be more colorful and allow you to have more art
2317871 if you go outside the full spectrum is there color is life and it constantly surrounds us
2317872 were sorry but we cant do anything this is all the management allowed to give us
2317873 cebu pacific is committed to giving you quality service at the lowest airfare possible and now with our brand new airbus fleet we believe its time every juan flies
2317874 sen obama and i are working together to make sure its a big success
2317875 as is true in all conventions were still working out the mechanics the coordination
2317876 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2317877 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2317878 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2317879 are you truly supporting sen obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2317880 i am completely committed to helping sen obama become the next president of the united states and urging all of you to do the same we share a commitment to universal health care bringing an end to the war in iraq and getting back to an economy that works for working families again
2317881 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2317882 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2317883 the roman catholic archdiocese like many other churches is challenged by the reality of having fewer and fewer clergy
2317884 as a result there are not enough priests to continue 24 7 on call sacramental care to patients
2317885 we are reviewing the situation and working with the archdiocese to develop a long term strategy for addressing this issue
2317886 and so when theyve already fulfilled all of their parish obligations its not always possible for them to respond to hospital calls
2317887 its one thing to be on call in the middle of the night when youre 30
2317888 its quite another to be on call when youre 70
2317889 and the particular role that a priest carries is the role of celebrating the sacraments two particular sacraments anointing with oil and confession with the sick and thats the part of the chaplaincy that will not be offered a few nights a month
2317890 thats simply to say we dont have a priest on call to immediately come when a person might make that request
2317891 i think it may have a very significant impact on some persons at very particular times theres still priests available theres still sacramental ministry available most of the time
2317892 ive made my thoughts known pretty publicly that were not pleased with their lifestyle
2317893 we have to be wary because we know from past experience how people who are uninformed can get their minds rolling
2317894 i cant do a lot of physical work so i really enjoy coloring these for the children
2317895 i didnt want to be intimidated every time i went to the store or any time i did anything
2317896 you should tell them we like this little town and we are sorry that they dont like us
2317897 i wouldnt say this community is scared about what is going on i would say they are deeply concerned about what could be going on
2317898 ive had people tell me they cant fall asleep at night for fear there are victims of that in our county and they cant do anything
2317899 we all need to consider the effect on our property values
2317900 if they come in here en masse its a threat to our property values but also our ranching way of life it is almost like a gawd darn plague that you have to deal with
2317901 what we saw were very kind honest hard working people
2317902 not one person in our group in colorado is on welfare not one
2317903 until we can prove something criminal is going on we will try to be civil with them
2317904 then that hatewatch article came out and all of a sudden we had neighbors who thought we were horrible people
2317905 right now im in the corner of the oakland airport and im looking at a big bag of cds that i brought on this trip
2317906 i happened to hear a recording of their fences and i realized that i wanted kronos to bring this image of turning a fence into a musical experience
2317907 in this bag ive got music from china indonesia all over the middle east
2317908 its amazing the way music is flourishing in our time in spite of all the things we read about every day in the newspaper theres something happening that is so worthwhile and worth celebrating and thats what i want kronos to do to really celebrate the time that were in and what can be a part of the texture of a musical experience
2317909 ever since bush and cheney and rumsfeld decided to invade iraq ive been trying to find iraqi music thats right for us to play
2317910 we were trying to think of how we can update our audience at tanglewood with some of the music we havent played there before
2317911 theres over 650 pieces that have been written for kronos and i guess i feel like my responsibility is to make it more and more difficult for us to choose what to play
2317912 we get something new from him about every 10 years
2317913 two shrimp one scallop oh and ps its not spicy either
2317914 schwarzenegger is right to look at the sales tax instead of raising income tax on the rich
2317915 not only that but buying an annual subscription will give you access to both calling all cars and the resistance 2 beta which will be happening later this year
2317916 not only that but buying an annual subscription will give you access to both calling all cars and the resistance 2 beta which will be happening later this year
2317917 a single village in china is responsible for cranking out
2317918 and more realistic than i expected i never was much into regular video games but when i realized that you really do have to swing your arms and twist and
2317919 build it right is not gone as a result of yesterdays announcement regarding the canada games new mainland common centre
2317920 we are stronger by it and ask all of the people of hrm to join us in asking the simple question to our elected representatives will you have an open public meeting to present your views perhaps that is best left to an election
2317921 we are thrilled with the announcement of a state of the art dry land facility but we feel that the aquatic side of the facility has not been given the same investment and there was no mention of ice surfaces
2317922 these are things that we have fought long and hard for as a community group so we have mixed feelings we have the space we have the technology and obviously we have the tax base why not build what the community and the province needs why not build it right the first time
2317923 after years of planning it is now time to start the construction of the long awaited state of the art centre which will be a wonderful addition to the community and one of the finest of its kind in the country
2317924 we have waited for this day for a very long time
2317925 the facility will open up a whole new world of opportunity for all those who use it
2317926 it will provide a place for the development of local athletes and a centre for high performance sport community wellness and active living programs
2317927 we also want to thank the provincial government and the government of canada for recognizing the importance of this project through their funding contributions
2317928 and stefan asbury has been such a great conductor to watch work
2317929 we all had to learn pieces in 24 hours it was more of a practical situation than emotional
2317930 that was the main reason i wanted to come here
2317931 for me levine is one of the ultimate opera conductors he does it perfectly right and i love the way he works with the singers
2317932 they were disappointed but remember jim had confidence in erik
2317933 and as i told them it would be a way of jim keeping his hand in and keeping himself attached to what was very much his baby
2317934 when i heard the singers were in a sense on my side i thought i can do this
2317935 hes the guy in charge not the guy following the guy in charge
2317936 erik will set the parameters the tempos the balance and the musical feeling
2317937 the pressure it depends on whether you realize theres pressure if you dont youre blissfully ignorant
2317938 im thinking ok im working with the greatest conductor in the world and now im working with somebody ive never met before
2317939 but eriks been absolutely great as for jimmy there is this kind of ethereal presence that is really strong the presence that passes through the airwaves
2317940 the space before the word no is just too much
2317941 were talking about the breaking down of a sentence of dialogue
2317942 i cant tell you how many times he said shorter shorter i felt justified
2317943 i said one musician is going to hate me if i say play it shorter
2317944 hes been a very interesting combination of feeling he can do this and being confident but being pretty humble how many conductors are for heavens sake
2317945 my role is reading the score and making sure everybodys doing it in the way a composer intended it to be done
2317946 if youre doing that theres no time to think about anything else
2317947 saya ayi kakaknya ayu sahabat nanda nanda kan sering maen di rumah saya pernah lihat tante antar dan jemput nanda
2317948 if i do step back i would want to do that with a title
2317949 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2317950 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2317951 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2317952 developed a valuable niche between the expensive car dealer service operations and the inexpensive single service shops such as oil change outfits

2317955 we want to study in the united states its a modern country and more safe than here in kabul if i became rich here i would be worried about security its dangerous to have money because of the kidnapping
2317956 we are really excited to have jacob on our team this fall we think we can have astrong vault program here at my first choice because i loved the campus immediately felt welcomed by everyone and i just knew i belonged here
2317957 there are only two ways to live your life one is as though nothing is a miracle the other is as though everything is a miracle
2317958 if the polls are right a public tired of republicans is beginning to think an increasingly bothersome obama would be no better
2317959 i had dinner once with richard clark at the table and i said is there an equivalent to the patriot act an ipatriot act just sitting waiting for some substantial event just waiting for them to come have the excuse for radically changing the way the internet works
2317960 guarantees itll be easy for unscrupulous players to cheat and thats obviously whats going on here
2317961 the safest course of action is to say we wont certify imports from china because their law wont allow inspections
2317962 everybody there is so proud of increased production that few people ask much about the farmers production methods
2317963 everything was just food and it was until the 1950s mostly organic by our contemporary definitions fertilized with human and animal waste compost and ashes
2317964 so that respected members of the organic community can monitor and police violations of organic standards on the part of producers importers and certifiers

2317968 we are very proud to assist the ymca of greater halifax dartmouth in its ongoing effort to provide quality recreational facilities for the people of hrm
2317969 the ymca is a true partner in our efforts to make nova scotia the healthiest and safest province in canada
2317970 it is a magical thing to see what can come out of affordable access to a well maintained swimming pool and community centre
2317971 these wellness facilities serve not only the students and staff of the college but also the greater community in dartmouth and surrounding areas
2317972 when we reviewed the availability of pool facilities in the area it was clear that this facility while small fills an important void which would be nearly impossible to fill if it had been forced to close
2317973 this facility also serves an important role in providing subsidized recreation services to a community which is heavily in need
2317974 i am with you give firmness to the believers i will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips off them
2317975 remote viewing is a lot more exciting and successful than the traditional multiple choice guessing methods the card guessing tests that we had originally tried to turn into learning situations by giving people immediate feedback trying to see the location where someone is hiding perhaps anywhere in the world is just plain sexier and more intriguing than guessing numbers or cards over and over again
2317976 i give all the meaning there is to everyhting i see experience i the big i you we and whomever give life its meaning in some form or fashion who wants to take the
2317977 we must not take offense at everything that happens to us
2317978 i am much more interested in questioning answers than my previous speciality of answering questions
2317979 the donations are basically through and through illegal thats number one and number two is how the obama campaign tried to conceal it
2317980 they listed the campaign contributions as coming from rafah georgia they used the ga from gaza so it makes it look like its legal and then for the zip code it says 972 which is actually the area code to dial over to gaza
2317981 accept thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit and theyre also going to flout federal election commission restrictions thats very indicative of what kind of president obama is going to be
2317982 theyre not going to be worried about the details and they wont mind if they break the law to get to the final result that they want

2317985 de blob was originally developed as a free downloadable game for the windows pc by eight students studying game design amp development at the utrecht school of the arts and one student studying game and media technology at utrecht university in the netherlands at the time of conception sections of utrecht were being rebuilt and the principal task in creating the game was to convey how the railroad station area of utrecht would look in 10 years the city of utrecht has adopted the de blob character as its mascot 4 thq noticed the game and was very impressed with the teams work and acquired the rights to the game thq handed over the game to blue tongue and helixe and the companies each developed their own versions for different consoles

2317999 why is the political debate in the uk so exasperatingly dull
2318000 the mythical centre ground is the pursuit of every ambitious leadership away from the lecture theatres the political options available to those who are not racist or apocalyptical greens are in reality just different brands of the same product of course there are nuances of difference amongst the red blue and yellow parliamentary triumvirate but the deafening lack of atmosphere in the political arena is leading to a pandemic of apathy
2318001 the political spectrum has contracted and those beholding views which are contrary to the status quo cannot get their voices heard having three seemingly interchangeable parties has led to debates on economic foreign and social policy being conducted within the confines of perceived moderation whilst ignoring more radical but potentially preferable alternatives
2318002 there are big issues which affect our society and our daily lives which simply are not scrutinised or debated globalisation multiculturalism the monarchy the house of lords abortion faith and independent schools the penal system and europe are issues which i have strong views on but cannot relate with any of the political parties its not that they have contrary policies but rather that they have none at all or are in agreement with each other surely signifying the death of democratic choice
2318003 party politics is not the issue as you may have come to think i believe it is the parliamentary system we need not to kill political parties but enliven them and have more of them it needs to be easier for parties to access westminster gain credibility and attract heavyweight political figures the national debate would diversify intensify and diminish voter apathy
2318004 proportional representation is the solution perhaps i am overly optimistic i am aware that it is not a flawless system but it is more democratic and would lead to a vibrant parliament which is home to alternative views alongside conventional ones and so what if the bnp get a seat or two if they won the votes they should get the representation parliament is not a liberal club it is the voice of the nation

2318016 we are proud to stand with these courageous christians who were willing to risk their freedom to speak out on behalf of those who have none the world heard the message loud and clear that basic human freedoms must be restored in china if that nation is ever to take its place as a leader in the world

2318033 what i want to do is see whether or not hes a defensive player see where his temperament is at see the things that he can do on defense hes an outstanding long snapper he may be our long snapper next season but we really feel good about what hes going to contribute to our team

2318191 what i dont like is the view of entitlement of if i am not going to play i am going to redshirt i think a redshirt is to be earned now
2318192 it is a different philosophy but just because a player is on the team for one year and doesnt play doesnt mean that that year is a year he is going to have back eligibility wise
2318193 since that tone has been set i like it and i think it prepares them more for the real world where you cant really take a year off and just be in an organization or on a team and expect it to be paid for
2318194 it was one thing on my part that i think organizationally we needed to change
2318195 they will have to earn the redshirt year as a privilege which is what it is

2318199 he grabbed my shoulder harder than in the beginning and i thought this is not good
2318200 he was bobbing in and out of the water and then we were both going down a bit
2318201 for him to sacrifice that goal and stop and help another athlete he still wound up not being the last out of the water
2318202 because periyakoil wasnt a strong swimmer it made him aware and more empathetic to the situation
2318203 i just think that during a race so many people are focused on themselves
2318204 kas took time out of his race to help somebody else it just shows the kind of guy he is
2318205 despite that he was still out there a lot of people would have quit at that point
2318206 its an honor to be with people like that and coach them i get more kicks from someone like him than seeing someone on a podium

2318220 cuando termin la serie me sent liberado durante mi participaci n en expedientes dif cilmente me quedaba tiempo para hacer alguna otra cosa y s llegu a tener miedo de quedar encasillado en el personaje
2318221 me sent incre ble volviendo a ser mulder esa sensaci n de familiaridad nica cuando llega el momento del rodaje no me cuesta trabajo meterme en el personaje

2318235 i dont think it has anything to do with bikinis or not bikinis
2318236 the sport has a sex appeal that track and field and some others dont but this is not tennis and its not golf you can make noise any time you want
2318237 people used to think you guys are just a bunch of girls in bathing suits running around
2318238 but when people come to an event they see the athleticism then they get caught up in everything the venue will be hopping
2318239 before when you said beach volleyball people said oh the united states and brazil

2318245 its true that baby powder scent is popular with women because they love that new baby smell
2318246 i have two daughters who are all grown up but i can still remember what they smelled like when they were babies
2318247 but the real trend among men these days is makeup a lot of guys are buying it its not for me but if you want to look better go for it
2318248 one application lasts for a week and makes you look bronzed
2318249 it looks like a flock of birds landed on my face
2318250 although i ought to cut up my credit cards that would really be plastic surgery
2318251 you are in the red and orange range theyre warm colors which means you would look good wearing brown green or gold
2318252 but you really dont have any your face is very clear and very smooth
2318253 i look like a baby and i smell like a baby
2318254 if you just love to drive your boat and need to take care of it yourself i suppose this isnt for you
2318255 but i loved the concept i had been looking into buying a bigger boat but i didnt have the time to take care of it
2318256 this is a very classic traditional boat outfitted to be very elegant
2318257 this is not p diddy in his big white yacht docked off saint tropez it is a low key refined destination but has every amenity you could imagine weve got satellite tv and an xbox for the kids and you know the boat is so nice i hope everyone ignores the xbox and just enjoy the views but we created it so everything is here if you want it
2318258 we are more like a country club than a time share in a time share you are limited on when and where you can go membership fees also buy access to osprey boats docked in newport and palm beach with a possible vessel in the naples area of florida soon baxter says
2318259 it was very special the food and the service have been top notch every time ive been out
2318260 and all i had to do was call and book it
2318261 what im getting now is a bigger better boating experience
2318262 i have access to a fabulous boat with absolutely no headaches
2318263 five point six did you have your glasses on pal that was a 6 0 performance if i ever saw one what were you thinking pfft judges
2318264 part of it is a tribute the other part is rooted in our disgust with what the music industry has become
2318265 the type of songs that artists are performing and producing are not up to caliber with what were accustomed to im talking about the marvin gayes the four tops and the babyfaces were trying to shed some light on this for the younger generation of artists who dont know about the history of music
2318266 a lot of artists that have come through the system have taken parts of what weve done
2318267 most give credit to the group the only downfall is that some of those groups feel theyre the first ones to do it
2318268 but they dont realize that 90 percent of the samples come from r amp b songs
2318269 were going do what weve always done were r amp b singers
2318270 when we first came out we did motown philly but we dont want to stray too far from what we do were not rappers theres an audience out there that likes what we do that keeps us on the road eight months out of the year
2318271 and when i watch the credits i know who everyone is right down to the camera guys
2318272 i thought id blend back into the crowd but people dont forget they come up to me and say youre that idol guy its kind of cool
2318273 idol was one of the single coolest things ive ever done i experienced the whole trip its something i will never forget
2318274 id been playing the bar scene for the better part of 12 years by the time i got on the show
2318275 it was harder for me to break old habits i was fighting the stage sound being on the tv stage is a different kind of thing you have to learn the way the microphone sounds for example
2318276 i was a guitar player before i was a singer and may was an early childhood hero
2318277 he was a super nice guy someone you could hang out with and chat
2318278 i had no offers so i decided to do it myself i went into production with the band in the studio and we finished about two weeks ago
2318279 modern pop rock fused with down east electric violin playing
2318280 i write the lyrics and the bulk of the music and the other guys come up with arrangement ideas the core songwriting is my thing and we turn it into a song together
2318281 its a great opportunity with my profile raised its my responsibility to put my name to good use and d250 is right up my alley its something i can stand behind and believe in
2318282 now the campaign has brought to my attention how much the vote is down in younger people i wont miss another one
2318283 theres something very freeing about being on the top deck of a ship i love doing outdoor shows ive been a slave to the bar scene for so long
2318284 i do a lot of my favourites stuff i did on the show like kiss from a rose every breath you take songs by bands i grew up with like matchbox 20 and bon jovi
2318285 by adding a gene weve essentially been able to take embryonic stem cells which make everything and push them a little bit down one particular pathway the endoderm pathway
2318286 and thats the pathway of the cells that give rise to all the tissues of the gut to the lungs to the liver to the pancreas to very important cells that one day could be used for regenerative medicine
2318287 these cells themselves would not be used for transplantation but theyre a tool to help us understand that process
2318288 so we created a new kind of stem cell limited to making only one cell type
2318289 its just really about controlling stem cells is really what it comes down to
2318290 were one step closer to being able to use these cells if were one step closer to being able to control what they can become
2318291 how do you get a cell that can become over 200 different things to become one thing and not the other 199
2318292 i think what theyve done is establish a proof of principle that stem cells can be directed in a very refined way
2318293 energy savings were not exactly a hot topic among customers last year
2318294 but this year nine out of ten people ask point blank whether a product will help them save money
2318295 going green is not only eco friendly but crucial for business
2318296 this goes beyond just products extending throughout the development and manufacturing process
2318297 my electricity bill more than doubles in the summer as we turn on the air conditioner
2318298 i also have to do lots of laundry for the kids the bill now easily tops 170 000 won 86 pounds a month
2318299 we arent sure if it is the batman effect or what but sales to men have been going through the roof
2318300 men have begun to dominate the hosiery market once owned by women
2318301 it has nothing to do with being gender confused or gay as the bulk of wearers are straight men in long term relationships
2318302 the trend continued until about the end of the 19th century when the womenfolk stole the idea for themselves
2318303 with energy prices going up and up i think were going to see even more men around the world wearing these products
2318304 its like painting a good picture for others to see it

2318308 the condo board isnt in a position to make a call
2318309 if they dont respond or say no theyve turned down what is very likely a reasonable request
2318310 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2318311 by any reasonable calculation of annual tire inflation and tune up savings
2318312 the outer continental shelf holds nearly a hundred times as much oil as for oil shale also under federal moratorium after a thousand years of driving with obama inflated tires and obama tuned engines we would still have saved only one fifth the oil shale available in the united states
2318313 drilling requires no government program no newly created bureaucracy no pie in the sky technologies that no one has yet invented it requires only one thing only one act lift the moratorium private industry will do the rest and far from draining the treasury it will replenish it with direct taxes and with the indirect taxes from the thousands of non subsidized new jobs created
2318314 well we found it really hard to schedule people its not easy to bring people in to speak
2318315 well then you should not have scheduled avrum burg because it is not an effective counterpoint to simply have the audience respond to him the only truly efective counterpoint to his perspective is to have an academic who is an arab refusnik counter his blood libels

2318321 a war is just if there is no alternative and the resort to arms is legitimate if they represent your last hope
2318322 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2318323 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2318324 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2318325 what couldnt think of how to design an actual challenge instead you want to make sure we dont get out of adventure mode without using the dodge moves that are otherwise never required there
2318326 then hammer the pause button like you were playing a 2p mario game with your annoying cousin and you really wanted to up one of his jumps
2318327 if your aim was bad or you were using toad your key might end up riding around on the back of an enemy or dropping down a pit if you killed phanto but lost your key in the process then screw you go back and get it again complete with another phanto on your ass in some levels this could become a never ending cycle of suffering
2318328 rome 1960 the olympics that changed the world is to ignore its hyperbolic subtitle and plunge like a 10 meter platform diver into the games themselves
2318329 theres one guy we dont have to worry about but the bare footed bikila outdistanced them all winning by 25 seconds and setting a new olympic record proving his victory wasnt a fluke he won again four years later in tokyo bettering his rome performance
2318330 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
2318331 honey fetch my pepper spray and a meat hammer this looks like trouble
2318332 he was experiencing a mental psychosis because of several setbacks
2318333 he broke his leg running from the crime scene you can see
2318334 it was made clear several months ago that mentioning his middle name is a forbidden act
2318335 having nothing honorable to say obama warned his followers last week that sen
2318336 has made it clear that the mere use of his name would be freighted with coded innuendoes of something too horrible to say straightforwardly
2318337 basically i picked msu because ive always wanted to go here
2318338 im going to do everything i can to be a great player and lead michigan state to a national championship
2318339 coach izzo was jumping up and down shaking everyones hands
2318340 he was ecstatic he said they like my ability to not only score the ball but give it to my teammates
2318341 the graffiti includes profanity swastikas kkk and a derogatory term for east asians
2318342 some white supremacists believe election of obama would set off backlash they long for
2318343 forest of trees is my photographic story of a family of trees oak trees which are living out their silent peaceful lives on land owned by members of my own family
2318344 thats a year removed we dont dwell on those things you guys do
2318345 i just try to keep things as simple as possible i try to lead a lap to get the five bonus points and try to lead the most laps if i can and try to finish as good as i can without sticking it in the fence
2318346 fortunately we have been lucky enough to win seven races we can only hope that we win a couple more and try to get further ahead of the competition when the chase starts
2318347 yes i think so i think a lot of it might have been not so much the competition itself but the personalities the dale earnhardts the darrell waltrips the bobby allisons and others
2318348 we have a lot of great personalities now but the sport itself has become a whole lot more corporate and a lot less personal in that respect you have to be a whole lot more stale today than you want to be
2318349 the racing was different but i personally dont think it was better then i think actually if you laid down two races side by side what we have today and what they had then i think you would sell more tickets to what we have today but i think if you ask the fans what lot of drivers they would prefer they might say the old guys i would
2318350 i wouldnt like to see it done just by watching the race last week there was really no passing unless someone ran off the racetrack
2318351 i thought goodyear did an excellent job of showing how prepared they were for that
2318352 im their biggest critic at times but im the first guy that when they do things right im going to praise them too
2318353 i would think the object of baseball is not only winning but also youre in the entertainment business putting a team on the field that people want to see the oakland as put a team on the field right now that
2318354 whos a big star on that team whos someone you wanna go see play what is there entertaining about watching a bunch of anonymous triple a players play for the oakland as
2318355 its too bad it would have been nice for us to finish off the game
2318356 but the idea is to improve from the first preseason game to the second weve got a lot to work on
2318357 when we have good protection the turnovers are going to go down when youre not under duress you have the ability to make better decisions
2318358 i liked the way he moved the ball down the field
2318359 walking along a trail i picked up a rock and threw it half the way across a pond justin then picked up a rock and threw it all the way across the pond at that point we knew he had a special arm
2318360 this is a first for me im in a situation where no one expects anything whatever i do will be a plus as long as i play hard and play smart im just happy to be in this situation its the first time i was able to pick where i wanted to go
2318361 theyre more of a half court pound it out type of team and thats more suited to me
2318362 i think ive been one of the underrated defenders in the league i think thats exactly what this team needs
2318363 sheffield said he has not felt this good physically since the first half of last season when he batted over 300 and hit 21 home runs under contract for 14 million this year and next sheffield said he believes he will be a productive player through the end of the 2009 season i know i have another year on my contract so i put in the work
2318364 if sheffield is indeed back to normal the tigers lineup all of a sudde ian casselberry
2318365 eh saya mau dong jadi best friend kamu ayo kita mulai buat appointment 3 bulan ke depan

2318367 i can do no wrong because nothing is my fault racism etc
2318368 i do want to say that the information in the blog about adam is completely one sided i know for a fact that the church has offered different choices of how to deal with adam in mass they have offered the crying room exclusively to them they have offered private masses and yet the mother has refused all of these it upsets me that a kid has to go through this but it also upsets me that a mother would put her kid through this sitting or restraining adam in mass is a form of calming him down which means he is under stress im sure the options offered would actually put adam under less stress due to less people
2318369 im not going to buy that there is a such thing as autism
2318370 hey dont beat my kid but you can feed him fishie crackers if ya want
2318371 ningu m viu bem ningu m ouviu n o reconhecem o criminoso etc
2318372 the only way to balance the market is by choking off demand which would require a spike above 200
2318373 oil has been very cheap now its becoming rather expensive
2318374 everyone expected a normal market response to higher prices would be an expansion of production but that hasnt happened
2318375 if you have sporty ambition please use our speedy stairwell
2318376 have you always dreamed of going out with someone who says can you help me finish my beer
2318377 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2318378 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2318379 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
2318380 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2318381 weve had these back and forths with china for years
2318382 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
2318383 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
2318384 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
2318385 we get support of our president that means a lot that means a lot of people back home want us to succeed
2318386 so we have to go out there and play like were representing the us of a
2318387 now we have to go against holland then nigeria i couldnt be happier the guys couldnt be happier peter nowak the coach couldnt be happier
2318388 he was in a very difficult situation with a whole country behind him
2318389 its better for him to stay there where hes happy and let him come back with the gold medal
2318390 its really the olympic games and the u s open that matter to me in this point of my career
2318391 if liu could not win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless
2318392 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
2318393 our decision was not intended to insult the beijing organizing committee or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality
2318394 this idea about the rest of the world being intimidated by us is gone said jerry colangelo usa basketball managing director
2318395 you could see it and feel it in barcelona but thats yesterdays news
2318396 its just been one thing after another olympic historian david wallechinsky said
2318397 the u s has been completely terrible in team sports
2318398 the public reaction will be interesting if we continue to get drubbed in basketball said mark dyreson author of
2318399 they cheer and we care every four years because of the flags and anthems
2318400 we didnt show enough respect to the rest of the world so were taking nothing for granted weve tried to instill some national pride in wearing usa across your chest
2318401 one of the reasons why americans are losing in some of these sports is because theyre playing really good teams dyreson said
2318402 sometimes other countries have teams that train more together and are more interested in the outcome we cant rely on our superior talent anymore because our talent isnt that superior
2318403 there appears to be something that goes on when you have an unpopular war he said
2318404 in team sports there is an unquantifiable element of national pride youre always representing yourself and your team but at the olympics theres also an added element of representing your country theres a feeling that goes through you
2318405 rome 1960 the olympics that changed the world one theme is how those games served as a propaganda battleground during the height of the cold war
2318406 i dont think it has anything to do with patriotism he said
2318407 the reality is someone else was just a little better that day
2318408 the difference between then and now is players really want to be on this team colangelo said
2318409 it hasnt been this way for a long long time
2318410 i dont think theyre going to allow anyone else to win the gold medal this time
2318411 the chinese have put a great deal of time money and no doubt performance enhancing substances that they think they wont get caught with into this
2318412 youre going to hear things about how were not that bad off and the world really doesnt hate us and were still a great nation
2318413 twenty barrows a day pass this checkpoint that soldier just wants to make a problem for me
2318414 he can carry his stuff into the souk market but he must leave the barrow
2318415 i know i have another year on my contract so i put in the work
2318416 i want to finish what i started i knew eventually i would get better and i would be healthy but it was a process a painful process a frustrating process
2318417 youd better not throw it down the middle of the plate thats the way i am you had your fun with me while im down come after me now
2318418 its terrible ill go on record and say its terrible worst ive ever seen and pitchers know it thats why they get easy strike ones they get easy strikeouts they know youve got to swing
2318419 the pills were sent for analysis and tested positive for stanozolol
2318420 he was an hourly employee with the former staff in weight and conditioning and had not been retained by the new staff of mike barwis
2318421 because he was an hourly employee retained for a year he began working with teams in olympic sports he has since been relieved of his hourly responsibilities today and until further notice
2318422 jordon as weve said from day one hes a great instinct guy
2318423 weve just got to make sure hes going the right way all the time
2318424 unreal state of excistence the self dissociation characteristic of the mass media also typifies the psychological structure of young people they have now become omnipotent through assimilation to the mass media which have a magical power over society
2318425 for an account on burikko see below under idols it indicates the type of person who can not communicate with others is highly concerned about details and has one exclusive and maniac field of interest otaku tend to get fat have long hair and wear t shirts and jeans the word corresponds to nerd which in the usa is used for computer and sf fanatics
2318426 they are easily visible because they dont care about the way they dress
2318427 with computers they get really involved computer game programers live on potato chips that they eat with chopsticks and on coffee milk they have a different rhythm are awake for 40 hours and then sleep for 12 computer otaku are said to be able to make love with a girl on the screen but i think many want a girl friend but cant get one
2318428 otaku are a product of hyper capitalism and the hyper consumption society
2318429 today otaku has taken on an extremely wide meaning originally it was connected with a precise stereotyped image it symbolized a human relationship for which the other forms of saying you would be too intimate otaku refered to the space between them they are far from each other not familiar
2318430 children are taught to take in the world as data and information in a fragmentary way not systematically the system is designed for cramming them with dates names and multiple choice answeres for exames the scraps of information are never combined into a total view of the world they dont have a knowledge value but the character of a fetish
2318431 the original otaku shows us that we are all information fetishists
2318432 japanese people are in a sense fetish people they dont tell the animate from the inanimate this fact is an important background of the otaku the two dimension complex is a kind of animism they tread humans as things and things as humans
2318433 wing thats gret sic it covers various kinds of comics and novels which makes you feel at home
2318434 rorikon lolita complex was named after vladimir nabokovs novel it signifies the strange sexual taste for teenage girls
2318435 one also calls the otaku a yaoi zoku the generation of fans of young girls the suspected child murderer miyazakis victims we heard about him already and will hear still more below were between age four and seven meaning younger than the teenagers that rorikon are supposed to like so is it not a mistake to call him an otaku
2318436 he lacks understanding of life and death and has a strong desire to return to his mothers womb
2318437 we want to understand him but we know we dont everybody asks why has he done that but we should rather ask why dont we do it many otaku have the same life style as he but i dont think they would do such a thing miyazakis biography is not so special he could not communicate with women but thats not special it was said that he is living in a fantasy world but maybe we are all living in a fantasy i dont think hes crazy because i can understand a part of him so im scared but im not a moralist many japanese think miyazakis motivation is connected to our daily life with media and information and to our human relations so we are very shocked
2318438 see we never trusted these young people now you know what they are capable of
2318439 after miyazaki had spoiled otaku otakki was invented to refer to the original meaning and to the change that had taken place the otaku had moved to a new level where people wear expensive elegant yuppy clothes the otakki people try to improve their image from something dark to something bright
2318440 otaku is a way of involvement an underground way of changing the ideas about the world otaku are not satisfied with consuming they want to change things and programs they are so much involved the idol industry wants consumers otaku overfulfill their wish they dont stand for a classic confrontation but they do have the capability of an alternative view
2318441 they are no drop outs but part time outsiders i wonder whether otaku will create a new culture its a kind of experiment but i think otaku are the only way whether they have a subversive potential i hope so i hope they will become a real shinjinrui a new kind of japanese i mean a postmodern people
2318442 the question who is otucky is like the zen koan what is satori it can not be answered because satori is inherently that which can not be communicated
2318443 weve got to pitch better weve got to get the bullpen straightened out
2318444 weve got to get in sync with our bullpen were still not in sync weve got to get some roles weve got to get some sense of normalcy weve got to get settled in a little bit
2318445 once you decide youre going to do it youve got to go for it
2318446 that was real dangerous but he made a great play
2318447 realistically if we dont make a run then were probably not going to make a run
2318448 weve got to start playing better weve got to start stringing some wins together
2318449 id like to get down to three games or so by september 1st
2318450 were looking for players that want to dive right in
2318451 i dont want any toe in the water kind of players
2318452 well spend the majority of our time early on san diego state but i have a lot of respect for rich
2318453 his offense is a pain in the butt its going to be a very very challenging opponent
2318454 when you see him out there for a freshman you dont see anyone thats more chiseled or well defined than this guy
2318455 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
2318456 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2318457 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2318458 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
2318459 the implication that adult employer must bring their children to work in order to complete their daily tasks is false
2318460 bad school district where most of the whites moved out for good reason
2318461 in a relatively short time john has constructed and is executing a successful business model for the nhl
2318462 i dont think most edmontonians know that most other nhl arenas in canada were built with 100 per cent private financing and i dont think the committee wanted them to know either
2318463 i think that it shows its very biased and not a true indication of whats happening in this country in terms of who is paying for arenas
2318464 researchers took that information from another report but could not verify it to me so i took it out
2318465 theyre going to spin it in the best light possible
2318466 its sort of as a piece of propaganda i think thats the way to think about it
2318467 it is a characteristic of the car that does not fit with me at all
2318468 the problem is that of the four drivers i am the only one complaining about this issue and at toro rosso it is not for us to talk about the cars development
2318469 rooted in the diy subcultures of skateboarding surf punk hip hop amp graffiti
2318470 developed a valuable niche between the expensive car dealer service operations and the inexpensive single service shops such as oil change outfits
2318471 and the national pride that is being brought to bear here
2318472 it remains to be seen how these beijing olympics might change the world
2318473 its disappointing but no its more about me just doing other things i just need to move on
2318474 ive done all i can at the district ive served the district well and im proud of what ive done
2318475 whatever a district would ask we would figure out what we can do to help them
2318476 finding skilled technology professionals equally or more challenging compared to 12 months ago
2318477 i want to tell people about the situation im here as an athlete to be an ambassador of my country but i am a member of team darfur i was in that situation
2318478 but i said i want to be as fast as that guy thats what inspired me from that point on it was so great to see running with people cheering running is what we do all our lives its part of our transportation
2318479 its a pretty draining process this is new territory for everybody
2318480 i hit both of my routines durante said during training camp last month durante said he also hit all 12 of his routines he believed he had earned a spot
2318481 its an honor to be on this team but its a shame that it had to happen this way
2318482 its a tough position to be in but dave and i worked really hard we pushed each other because we have to stay in shape
2318483 its something that is to the point where my ankle is shutting down and its not responding to what im telling it to do he said at a news conference
2318484 as a result i cant do my gymnastics especially not safely
2318485 if liu could not win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless
2318486 people come here from places like india and china in such great numbers and theyre going to be following athletes from their home countries
2318487 so theres going to be some great discussions over lunchtime throughout santa clara county the next few weeks
2318488 chinese americans absolutely will be rooting for athletes such as basketball player yao ming
2318489 look what happens when a mexican soccer team comes to town all the mexican american fans come out to root for the mexican team
2318490 if they play in the final game i really wont have a preference who wins ill just enjoy watching
2318491 it just goes to show how globalization is not just something to do with trade
2318492 im really interested in the gymnastics and the diving because those are sports my friends do but everything else i really have no idea about their athletes
2318493 nbc has been heavily criticized in the past for zeroing in only on the american athletes at the exclusion of other countries athletes
2318494 but fortunately we now have access to a vast amount of reporting from other countries points of view we dont have to depend on just nbc
2318495 sometimes you get caught in a situation when the u s plays mexico in a sport and you wonder who do i root for
2318496 usually i just end up rooting for the best athlete
2318497 i feel that were the guys that every time we go there that everybody has to pay attention to us in order to win
2318498 now there are times we dont win obviously but were still in the hunt every time and got a shot
2318499 its not like were not running well because we are
2318500 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way youll have that
2318501 in nine years weve won four races if you cant be counted as a factor after that i dont know when they do count you as a factor
2318502 when you have a day like we had last year at the glen and the laps that we were ahead of jeff we could drive away from him a little bit it makes you feel good
2318503 celebration it was always advertised as being but in suggesting that the dawning age of aquarius is already destined for nightfall this new production establishes the show as more than a vivacious period piece
2318504 while both have increased from their low base as expected the overwhelming majority of the uks borrowers continue to pay their mortgages in full every month and will continue to do so
2318505 the cml is sticking with its forecast of 45 000 total possessions and 170 000 mortgages in arrears of more than three months by the end of 2008
2318506 while on paper the figures look bleak these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74 million mortgages in the uk
2318507 in general terms while arrears and possessions rates have risen across the industry the impact of the credit crunch has hit the adverse credit sector harder than most of the mainstream market which continues to perform well
2318508 in the 1990s the problems people faced were high unemployment and high interest rates
2318509 faced with stagnant earnings rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills the weight of debt is taking its toll on thousands of hard working brits who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet
2318510 in too many cases lenders are still not doing everything they can to help borrowers in trouble piling on extra charges not negotiating with borrowers to come to a workable solution over repayment arrangements and preferring to use court action as a first rather than a last resort
2318511 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2318512 producers such as venezuela could let production fall and nationalize the oil industry because there was no punishment for doing this when prices kept rising
2318513 proponents of peak oil who dont have the foggiest knowledge of petroleum geology
2318514 the peak oil alarmists fail to say anything about the vast amounts of oil being found in the gulf of mexico now or the major deal that chevron just did in oil rich angola
2318515 some of whom had expressed concern about the new contract provisions relative to paid holidays
2318516 in an effort to be responsive tyson asked the union to reopen the contract to address the holiday issue and the union agreed to do so
2318517 most kids will be returning to school in last years duds
2318518 ive been telling her what do you absolutely absolutely absolutely need
2318519 martinez said as they shopped yesterday at target in national city as cheyenne gravitated to a 20 belted khaki jacket her mother would focus her on 10 99 jeans and tops under 5
2318520 but we are going to wait for the jacket until we actually need it
2318521 my best friend shops at nordstrom and gets one cute thing id rather go to forever 21 and get four or five things for the same amount
2318522 its the first time weve seen any material slowdown in five years
2318523 she likes to have what no else has but i guess itll just have to be cookie cutter for her this year
2318524 i guess thats good because i wake up every morning and face these finances
2318525 the key really is to be honest and not make promises you cant keep
2318526 empathize with their feelings and maybe even share some of your own explaining that everyone is giving up something
2318527 this idea about the rest of the world being intimidated by us is gone said jerry colangelo the managing director of usa basketball
2318528 you could see it and feel it in barcelona but thats yesterdays news
2318529 its just been one thing after another olympic historian david wallechinsky said
2318530 the u s has been completely terrible in team sports
2318531 the public reaction will be interesting if we continue to get drubbed in basketball said mark dyreson author of
2318532 people turn on their tv sets they cheer and we care every four years because of the flags and anthems
2318533 our players attitude was a problem we didnt show enough respect to the rest of the world
2318534 so were taking nothing for granted weve tried to instill some national pride in wearing usa across your chest
2318535 one of the reasons why americans are losing in some of these sports is because theyre playing really good teams dyreson said
2318536 sometimes other countries have teams that train more together and are more interested in the outcome we cant rely on our superior talent anymore because our talent isnt that superior
2318537 there appears to be something that goes on when you have an unpopular war he said
2318538 in team sports there is an unquantifiable element of national pride youre always representing yourself and your team but at the olympics theres also an added element of representing your country theres a feeling that goes through you
2318539 rome 1960 the olympics that changed the world one of its themes is how those games served as a propaganda battleground during the height of the cold war
2318540 i dont think it has anything to do with patriotism he said
2318541 the reality is someone else was just a little better that day
2318542 the difference between then and now is players really want to be on this team colangelo said
2318543 it hasnt been this way for a long long time
2318544 i dont think theyre going to allow anyone else to win the gold medal this time
2318545 the chinese have put a great deal of time money and no doubt performance enhancing substances that they think they wont get caught with into this
2318546 youre going to hear things about how were not that bad off and the world really doesnt hate us and were still a great nation
2318547 many of these home care workers are still making minimum wage or slightly higher they dont have medical coverage
2318548 its a very sad story imagine raising a family on 15 000 a year
2318549 as scary as it is in these times to talk about going on strike theyre going to have to be prepared
2318550 the tragedy of this is that once they go home many of them cannot take care of their own families
2318551 im taking care of everybody else but i cant take care of me
2318552 i cannot believe what they are getting paid you get a person to take your dog for a walk they make more money than her
2318553 i have to wash them i have tochange them no 1 no 2 ifthey got a colostomy i have to clean it
2318554 ive got to turn them every twohours so we should be paid more
2318555 its not fair for me to be sick and i have to go to take care of somebody else
2318556 how can i take care of them when i cant take care of myself so we need medical benefits
2318557 damn hope that thing doesnt snap off and come crashing down on me
2318558 in practise the tendency to shelve all distinctions of adult and child male and female cultured and uncultured east and west in favour of a universal form of childish amae dependent behaviour can only be called a regression for mankind
2318559 present day society embraces an increasing number of people who have no sense of belonging to any party or organisation but instead are oriented towards non affiliation escape from controlled society and youth culture i have called them the moratorium people
2318560 be far less constricted in their thoughts and feelings than earlier generations
2318561 because of the new breeds preoccupation with pleasure and comfort it choses pleasure over pain recreation over work consumption over production appreciation over creation
2318562 what will become of japan if society continues to fragment into these self satisfied complacent micromasses the y live in tiny cabins on a huge ship they do not care if the sea is rough or calm nor do they care what direction the ship is taking their only desire is for life to remain pleasant in their cabins
2318563 all the independent comics and meeting places of the 1960s were disappearing by 1973 to 1974 and then com magazine folded it was a regression from being able to publish all kinds of stuff in mainstream magazines to only being able to publish unusual stuff in dojinshi underground magazines but what else can you do but start again from the underground
2318564 in 1980 people once again began to forget about dramatic social themes and manga began to move towards petty repetitive personal affairs rather like the i novels shishosetsu of the pre 1960 period in the 1980s new kinds of love comedies often within parody began in and dominated the amateur printed manga world
2318565 by the time he was two years old he would sit alone on a cushion and read manga books
2318566 the little girls he killed were no more than characters from his comic book life
2318567 the danger of a whole generation of youth who do not even experience the most primary two or three way relationship between themselves and their mother and father and who cannot make the transition from a fantasy world of videos and manga to reality is now extreme
2318568 todays elementary and middle schools students the otaku tribe are eclipsing society
2318569 it might sound terrible but there are over 100 000 people with the same pastimes as mr m we have a whole standing army of murderers
2318570 comic market is not an alternative society it is a vehicle orchestrated by you which thinks about its useful role in society it has become necessary for us to seek social acceptance
2318571 isolated people who no longer have any sense of isolation
2318572 do the yaoi girls and lolicom boys really have a future
2318573 an almost apocalyptic anxiety that the supposed pure and masculine culture of japan has been vulgarised feminized and infanticized to the point where it has become baby talk beyond the comprehension of well educated critics

2318581 daily camp observers report that all three candidates osullivan alex smith and shaun hill have scuffled more than a little as martzs offense has proven to be a major work in progress to say the least
2318582 word is osullivan has looked more like a leader under center showing a lot more fire and energy than either smith or hill up to now
2318583 as long as we recognize the power within us we will continue to have choices and we will continue to lead
2318584 it seems to me that theres a kind of hear no progress in iraq see no progress in iraq and most of all speak of no progress in iraq

2318589 republicans have a post 9 11 worldview and many democrats have a pre 9 11 worldview that doesnt make them unpatriotic not at all but it does make them wrong deeply and profoundly and consistently wrong
2318590 when the eagles are silent the parrots begin to jabber
2318591 the first amendment of the constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny
2318592 today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free
2318593 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
2318594 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure

2318610 we have seen a lot of neighbors who have called to complain about this
2318611 you end up having communities that are shipping their kids all over the place
2318612 its unfortunate that carmen chu didnt come to the school board with the resolution or at least show it to us before going to the supervisors
2318613 we as a society and as a city in particular have failed in that endeavor
2318614 i dont think san francisco parents for a number of reasons want real diversity in the classroom in any great measure im very disappointed but thats the reality
2318615 i do not feel really up to snuff in terms of entering into this arena right now
2318616 mccain has been a consistent supporter of expanding offshore drilling
2318617 if you were to compare a school nurse from 40 years ago she was someone who usually waited for a student who needed a band aid
2318618 we welcome those kids we want them to come to school and they have that right
2318619 but today school nurses are managing kids who need pharmaceuticals children with cardiac problems cancer kidney treatments
2318620 teachers have been told in the past that they would have to do certain things at one point the district wanted teachers to give shots our nurses were up in arms
2318621 not only is the california department of education breaking state law with this directive by violating the established scope of nursing practice but by negating the need for licensed nurses to administer insulin they are placing the children at risk
2318622 we have a certain degree of student population that are at risk and they have a right to have a medical professional to be there for their needs
2318623 were all very concerned about access to health care in the federal government
2318624 when kids come to school and theyve never had a checkup they come with a lot of health problems and its a real challenge
2318625 that to me is a challenge because how do we meet those needs of those in early education
2318626 through early detection we can see if a child needs a pair of glasses or has an ear infection if we just had a nurse in every school we would be available to follow up with these children
2318627 the environmental and transit groups advocate a well planned cost effective and environmentally sensitive high speed rail system in california they want high speed trains along the altamont route to help commuters from the central valley and sacramento who currently clog up interstates 80 and 580 this route would divert millions of regional trips annually to electrified rail yielding extremely significant air quality greenhouse gas reduction and energy savings benefits
2318628 some at the paper have begun to say so albeit quietly in the weeks since managing editor robert thomson put his leadership team in place as that shuffle was going on laurie hays the deputy managing editor in charge of investigations was leaving for a job at bloomberg her departure said to be at least partly the result of marginalization from above left the paper with only two women among its nine deputy m e s neither of them with a news job alix freedman the editor in charge of standards and ethics and cathy panagoulias who oversees staffing and then there was the recent buyout of carol hymowitz the management columnist who doubles as the papers point person on womens workplace issues put it all together and you have if not the makings of a clear pattern then at least a confluence worthy of comment especially in light of the questionable sexual politics at other murdoch owned outlets at fox news its an all but official rule that women must show their legs while at the new york post political correctness exists only to be mocked

2318643 setting a new standard alternatives to unsustainable plywood in the uk construction industry
2318644 tropical forests are being destroyed to make way for throw away products like plywood its time for architects specifiers and construction companies to clean up their act and we hope this report will provide the motivation for them to take action on this issue
2318645 no organisation has done more than greenpeace to draw attention to the perilous state of the worlds ancient forests there is now a need for urgent action to save what remains for the sake of the forests themselves and their unique wildlife and for the benefits they bring to our climate while governments dither and bicker this excellent report shows in a clear and compelling way that there is action that responsible businesses and all of us can take to help
2318646 this report promotes fsc which is a great tool for the construction industry to remove illegal plywood from the supply chain and replace it with sustainable plywood as a company actually doing this we endorse greenpeaces recommendations and would encourage all construction companies to follow suit

2318669 im currently looking for a job in music marketing promotions do you know of any music industry recruiters based in new york the recruiters that i have investigated so far do not help with promotions marketing placements

2318671 i like to shoot straight on these things so heres my take
2318672 to tax and to please no more than to love and to be wise is not given to men
2318673 to tax and to please is not given to californians who nonetheless have taxed themselves time and again if the need be clear and the purpose meritorious
2318674 there are too many examples of celebrities who get famous and then disappoint us with their failings theyre only human so as adults were not surprised but girls feel let down
2318675 what i did have was a passion for what i was doing helping girls by creating a forum to connect them to each other and show them that they are not alone
2318676 a magazine starring regular girls not celebrities or even models on the cover was a new concept and one that publishing experts had a hard time getting behind
2318677 just like anything new and unproven my ideas were met with a lot of skepticism they simply didnt believe ordinary girls could sell on newsstands
2318678 it was a relief to know that there were other girls out there exactly like me
2318679 i loved how discovery girls answered the questions that i was too afraid to ask or that older people in my life thought to be stupid or childish
2318680 discovery girls is a more wholesome representation of girls across the country i feel like there is starting to be a change and people are tired of being spoon fed stories about lindsay lohan and britney spears
2318681 we have a lot of weapons we have to play with more discipline so we can win the close games but i definitely think weve made a big improvement over last season

2318683 we used to live up on the hill and so every single day of my life id look down here and i could envision a vineyard
2318684 i could just see it so for me it was just the thing to do
2318685 it was one of the recommended ones for this particular site there were two or three others
2318686 we planted the vineyard and then all of sudden we said wow look at all these grapes that are growing
2318687 thats who he is its about family its about values
2318688 thats why i encouraged him to make his own wine theres no reason to give it to someone else
2318689 but ill tell you i was so proud i was very proud of his work he is so meticulous
2318690 when youre making wine you can always do different things to achieve different objectives
2318691 for example with 07 were trying to achieve a fruitier wine
2318692 we even look at the grapes before we crush them to be sure theres no funny looking grapes or bugs or anything we really look at them before theyre tossed in to the crusher
2318693 it lets you enjoy life the seasons you remember something about each year
2318694 it brings people together in the traditional italian sense you drink it you dont go to a bar and drink wine i keep telling people that wine is not something you drink to get drunk wine is something you use for friendship and for the table for food

2318702 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
2318703 i have to say ive been to a few of these games but im more excited to see it start than ever because i think were going to be so close to the line competitive in every event that we have here
2318704 every veteran olympian everyone thats been on the radar from the world championships top eights those are the people whose graphs are going this way
2318705 every athlete in every event is in a tough competition
2318706 if youve got a team youre going to have certain team members that are going to be injured it hasnt impacted at all on our confidence in our ability to achieve our objective when somebodys down somebody else is up
2318707 were all aware that most of our career will be judged on this event you win a world championship four times you can win 20 world cups if you win the olympics people will remember that
2318708 because we have a broader base from which those great success stories can come from then we have so much more security in feeling confident notwithstanding that we have hardships in individual circumstances that our goal is very much achievable
2318709 if we have big success in taekwondo it could turn into two medals
2318710 if we have bigger success than we expect in diving it could turn into two medals
2318711 that changes the mood of the team you can feel it in the olympic village people are saying yeah we won lets get going

2318716 fernando is a wonderful driver who would be a fantastic asset to any of the top teams including this one
2318717 the job ross and i have is to build a world championship winning team
2318718 he seems a pale imitation of the driver of the past
2318719 this raikkonen is not the driver that ferrari needs he needs to ask himself whether he really still has the desire
2318720 i never said anything like that somebody made it up
2318721 if you had asked me before the race in hungary who i would put money on i would have said lewis but i have to say i would want my bet back
2318722 he said before the race im not counting any chickens and getting ahead of myself but im absolutely certain he thought it was in the bag
2318723 if a very good team offered me a test drive for a year and a race drive for the next year thats a good prospect but id primarily prefer to have a race seat
2318724 i run a team in partnership with red bull and shouldnt mix personal things with business
2318725 but if bruno is clearly the best candidate then well discuss it anyway if hes gp2 champion it doesnt matter what his name is
2318726 i do think its going to have an effect on what people say its one of the most prominent cases of its type
2318727 even years into our adult lives we held out hope
2318728 we have quite a few projects this year but not on the same scale as last year
2318729 is continuing a pattern of what appears to us a willful disregard for the spending parameters set by the legislature
2318730 it looks like theyre spending money out there like a drunk sailor and we want it stopped now its nuts
2318731 when nedelkoff arrived the top person out there was making 125 000
2318732 theres too much money sloshing around and too much of it sloshing around with people with overlapping affiliations and allegiances by either blood or friendship or just ties over the years there are red flags all over these relationships
2318733 the church and its board must take great care to make sure the payments are fair to the church
2318734 the church says it does but is not clear how we can know
2318735 when i confronted her with that she pulled a knife and threatened to kill me thats when i made arrangements to get the kids out
2318736 i had gotten her a job a car set her up in an apartment
2318737 id helped her do all that when she decided she needed to go back
2318738 went out to the patio and angrily announced to several people that his check was not ready
2318739 were using gift cards and demagnetizing the magnetic strip of the cards they are then putting the stolen magnetic information from the stolen credit card onto the gift cards
2318740 we cant have a first rate education system in texas with a second rate accountability system
2318741 if brooks law were the whole picture linux would be impossible
2318742 i dont consider brooks law obsolete any more than newtonian physics is obsolete its just incomplete just as you get non newtonian effects at high energies and velocities you get non brooksian effects when transaction costs go low enough under sufficiently extreme conditions these secondary effects dominate the system you get nuclear explosions or linux
2318743 the mythical man month essays on software engineering anniversary edition
2318744 can be a very friendly fence with bougainvillea and vine growing all over it
2318745 john mccain is lying hell obviously say anything to get elected president american cant afford another president who has no regard for truth or the facts
2318746 were at the lowest level in oil prices in months and there is a real feeling that the trend has turned
2318747 lower oil prices are good for businesses and good for consumers for the inflation picture and they will improve growth somewhere down the line
2318748 its a pretty draining process this is new territory for everybody
2318749 i hit both of my routines durante said during training camp last month durante said he also hit all 12 of his routines he believed he had earned a spot
2318750 its an honor to be on this team but its a shame that it had to happen this way
2318751 its a tough position to be in but dave and i worked really hard we pushed each other because we have to stay in shape
2318752 its something that is to the point where my ankle is shutting down and its not responding to what im telling it to do he said at a news conference
2318753 as a result i cant do my gymnastics especially not safely
2318754 in merrills case its as serious and in a sense more serious because there was a clear effort at manipulation of research which is even a greater issue than the misleading sales of these auction rate securities instruments
2318755 that you will have fun while im gone you have to promise to play some computer games and have fun
2318756 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15 represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to move higher
2318757 i really feel that what investors are looking for right here is signs that the economy is starting to pick up right now
2318758 its more a hindrance than major flaw at this point
2318759 this new productivity data along with subdued wage increases indicate the fed may keep interest rates steady for the balance of 2008 and early 2009
2318760 ive been in towns where it was worse though not in new york state
2318761 waterfront is such a difficult area to value its so unique
2318762 the bottom line is that we treat each parcel as its own entity
2318763 and were trying to make property taxes fair and equitable for all people in each municipality
2318764 this use of legal action to silence the opposition is characteristic of author itarian governments
2318765 it would be a gross interference with freedom of political debate in canada and grossly unfair if the courts were to interfere and by way of injunction pre vent the official opposition party from using material already fully available in the public realm
2318766 studies are showing that the addi tion of fluoride to municipal water sup plies is having little effect on oral health
2318767 instead the recent studies provide mounting evidence that fluoride can adversely affect the neurological devel opment
2318768 so technically were still in the ex perimental stage after 60 years
2318769 has been controlled for far too long by the dental lobby
2318770 theyre preoccupied by one tissue the teeth whereas the opponents of flu oridation like myself see the body slightly differently
2318771 i believe health canada is not giv ing the citizens the truth on this issue
2318772 no studies have investigated a pos sible relationship between fluoridated water and lower iqs in children ar thritic symptoms in adults underac tive thyroid glands increased bone fractures in children and earlier onset of puberty
2318773 the science has not been done in canada if you dont look you dont find
2318774 i think there is a very strong case for the precautionary removal of this mass medication from our drinking water
2318775 there are studies which show changes in iq from populations ex posed to fluoride in drinking water the thing is if you look at an individu al you never really know that they may have been five points higher on the iq scale
2318776 we rely on science and expert re ports from around the world
2318777 i think lewis has definitely set himself up for a more intense training programme for the next three weeks by saying that
2318778 this break is essential for the mechanics and the rest of the people who travel with us
2318779 it shows that if the car is right i can show my potential
2318780 no one should think that we will now be on the podium all the time
2318781 our problem has been consistency but i hope we can start to turn that around starting now
2318782 every time i wanted to have a drink during the race i wanted to vomit
2318783 of the two litres in my drinks bottle i had maybe 0 2
2318784 from one year to the next it is difficult to improve so drastically
2318785 it may be difficult for renault to step up to the level of the top teams in 2009
2318786 never has a team gone from being one of the worst to winning in one year
2318787 we will carefully study the data and see if they have something that allows them to fill up faster
2318788 we are trying to grow and if we want to improve our performance we have to grow
2318789 i wouldnt say 50 people but i would say that we definitely want to strengthen ourselves for the future
2318790 as it is i would rather test for bmw sauber than race with them
2318791 of course a lot of good people are with force india but with their car you can basically only show your talent when it rains
2318792 hes a promising young talent and were looking forward to seeing what he can do here
2318793 i dont feel the heat limited or slowed me down at all
2318794 its harder for the cars for everybody but it was no problem
2318795 the details havent been finalized but were cautiously optimistic and very grateful for cpbs decision
2318796 the grant funds will allow us to pursue projects that otherwise might not have been possible basically the designation will help us to more fully realize the stations mission of serving as a voice for the community
2318797 operational expenses the production or acquisition of local and national programming or to strengthen community outreach activities
2318798 a lot of our equipment is in serious need of replacement or repair we are looking at some traffic management systems and computer software to help improve efficiency of course were looking at programming options and perhaps some of the funds will be used for marketing and syndication efforts well be developing those plans over the next weeks and months

2318800 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
2318801 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
2318802 just because you go to a public school you should still have the same opportunities
2318803 if you want your kid to go to a highly selective institution you really do have to know in the eighth grade
2318804 theyre locked in a death match with act over who takes the act or the sat once you buy into a certain product line youre likely to stick with it
2318805 by the time they apply to school the results would not be relevant
2318806 that plays out in kids real lives most of them are taking a hodgepodge of classes and by the end of 11th grade its too late
2318807 eighth grade is not the key year for college assessment thats sixth grade
2318808 now were going to have a preadmission test to get ready for the preadmission test get ready to get ready to get ready
2318809 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the psat and sat is just insane
2318810 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing and accountability is not testing
2318811 the eighth grade california standards test should tell us how children are prepared for high school im not sure we need it again in the ninth grade in the 10th grade and then the 11th grade teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
2318812 our primary purpose is to check on how effectively are schools preparing students and we see them as very important
2318813 california has a very shabby test setup a lot of these testing outfits are entrepreneurial theyre trying to make a buck
2318814 if there is a market to be served to add another test theyre more than willing to do that but if the test is well conceived it will have an instructional yield
2318815 we really hope people will take advantage of the two week program
2318816 i would think that gas would impact it quite a bit
2318817 gee i guess they had actual concerns to worry about instead of wasting resources on art
2318818 it is a technical not a creative skill art requires selective re creation the selection of camera angles lighting or lenses is merely a selection of the means to reproduce various aspects of the given i e of an existing concrete

2318821 we have residents that have lived in atherton more than 40 years along the tracks
2318822 a lot of the concern is that the authoritys board wasnt given accurate information about the relative impacts of the two alignments
2318823 the staff of the high speed rail authority i dont know if id say they cooked the books but they tilted things very strongly to make it look like the peninsula alignment had a lot less impact than it does
2318824 once we get additional water hopefully from the rainfall well be assessing things as we go
2318825 once we feel we have adequate water to bring the ponds water back online well do that

2318827 two trends weve seen are were investing in deals were already in and were keeping them alive longer because conditions are not ripe for an exit
2318828 were also giving more runway to portfolio companies when times are tight we want to overfund
2318829 since their net worth may be down angels have less to invest so were seeing that instead of one angel putting 100 000 into a deal four or five angels might put in 25 000 to 20 000 apiece

2318844 he was convicted of things that are not war crimes by a tribunal that has the power only to prosecute war crimes
2318845 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what we are looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country and i think that people who supported a whole range of different candidates during the primaries are going to come out of that convention feeling absolutely determined that we have to take the white house back

2318862 many patients in india enter into clinical trials because they have no better option to receiving care
2318863 one of the major problems of clinical trials in india is that they are not publicized as clinical trials
2318864 physicians are attracted by inducements of foreign travel funds and fame of the four stakeholders the sponsor or drug company hospital investigator and patient three are on one side
2318865 why should we keep india behind everyone else why close our doors for business when we have the capabilities
2318866 since trials for foreign sponsors must follow international rules they actually help raise indian standards the experience with other outsourcing industries has also been that more business has brought better regulation and monitoring
2318867 companies spend resources to train people and bring in expensive equipment
2318868 over time as the overload from big institutes flows to smaller ones in second tier cities the benefits will spread farther
2318869 conducting clinical trials is not like landing a man on the moon
2318870 those who say it will enable india to develop cutting edge technology are talking nonsense
2318871 a little bit careful so as not to bring disrepute to the industry and country

2318894 active faculty participation in pro bono work is highly important for the sake of their students law teachers teach as much about professional responsibility by what they do as by what they say if our conduct and actions are inconsistent with the principles and rules that we teach we undermine both our credibility as teachers and the legitimacy of the ethical principles and rules themselves
2318895 that all law schools adopt a formal policy to encourage and support faculty members to perform pro bono work
2318896 the guys really got along well and the chemistry was good
2318897 i think so far out of the three years that ive been here so far this is shaping out to be the best in that regard
2318898 not only is he a great player on the field but hes going to be a great guy in the locker room to help build and maintain that chemistry that i was talking about
2318899 i think we should make some pretty good jumps forward from last year
2318900 i think our whole pass offense our pass protecting included thats a focus of ours now and i think were going to continue to get better theres no substitute for experience and a lot of these young guys that we have are just getting reps and reps and getting better
2318901 hes our teammate hes a cornerstone of this team and i think everything will work out
2318902 hes going to have to do whats required of him but i think he knows that and everybodys behind him 100 percent
2318903 hes not real active at this point ive seen him driving around the community a bit
2318904 i talked to him a couple weeks before the u
2318905 hell come back hitting it pretty well ill promise you that i would say in my opinion the masters would be the target for his return to the pga tour i dont think there will be anything before that if it was before that it would be pretty amazing because he swings so hard and puts so much force on that knee it would take a long time to have it strong enough to hold up to him
2318906 i could see him way back in instructional league in his first year after he was drafted and signed
2318907 and hes just been a sponge about learning how to do things and the whole game hes becoming a real good complete player you like to get those young guys to do all facets of the game well and hes doing it real well
2318908 offensively hes always had real quick hands and been able to turn on a pitch early on we tried to get him to go the other way and be able to come back and pull so hes doing a nice job he utilizes his speed well hes fun to watch
2318909 if you look back it was a pretty close race
2318910 as a matter of fact i think span thought he had the job it was a real competitive spring between the two of them so he was on a mission when he got sent down he went to class aaa he didnt pout and to his credit he hung with it and got better at aaa he came up here and just took over
2318911 i think its going to be close to 1 million overall which is pretty significant

2318916 text messaging has been without question one of the great success stories of the mobile age both for the industry and consumer with announcements this month around reduced cost of sending and receiving text messages abroad this type of mobile operator action will only act to stimulate further growth in 2008 we are increasingly seeing other applications come into focus for business and consumer use mobile e mail and instant messaging represent new communication mediums but mobile operators need to simplify set up and access to encourage adoption

2318931 there are some other wonderful nations around the world if you dont bring your a game to court every game you are going to be vulnerable the us and us are hunted teams come in against us and figure they have nothing to lose
2318932 i saw them in october last year we have not played them at all they are new to the olympic games as a basketball nation especially with their women but they are a wonderful wonderful team
2318933 they nearly pipped russia coming from 20 points down at three quarter time at the european championship they can play and will be a great challenge for us
2318934 i think i have done it once before and that was at the last olympics
2318935 we will be up at 5 30am and at breakfast by 6am but is essential that we are ready physically and mentally to play

2318945 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
2318946 everyone suddenly has little doubts but its just more about can i do it again
2318947 every trials every taper its the same thats why i would like to have a memory chip that i could slide in her of how that athlete felt and the confidence from deep within because of what they have just done
2318948 it would be great but its not possible so you talk through things
2318949 she knows that she has been there before and it ended up being good so that gives a sense of confidence from within and thats where we are now
2318950 libby will never be not emotional but she can learn to deal on the day with the emotions
2318951 that makes her the really loving person she is that makes her a very giving person that makes her all these great human being things and its very rare to find very competitive people who are also very giving people that is not the most common human trait id say as a combination

2318980 if you were stranded on a deserted island what three things would you want with you
2318981 ive been to a few and cant help thinking that you would really enjoy yourself
2318982 our work force was exceptionally large for a paper this size
2318983 the reason for that was that this market was thriving and over the years we had been able to expand to a degree that most papers our size were not able to do as the economic activity slowed down it could no longer support that exceptionally large staff
2318984 come on youve had enough walking around bothering wildlife watering turnips and hugging cows surely you can find 20 minutes to try
2318985 its the knee injury thats been causing me a fair bit of stress lately
2318986 ive been so concentrated on my knee for the last few days that i havent had time to think about anything but that
2318987 a few weeks ago i was riding a three week grand tour tomorrow i will be riding a one day race
2318988 whether i did good at the tour de france or not im here to play my role as a member of the australian team and thats what ill be doing the knees caused a bit of an upset coming into it so im going to have to be pretty adaptable during the race and decide whether im here to ride for one of the other guys or if the race unfolds and im good whether to play the card and attempt to win himself
2318989 80 90 per cent of what would be my absolute best
2318990 when im here its not my position to state those opinions but thats no worries ive been questioned about far more stressful things in all honesty like the rumours that were going around my injury after the tour or why i didnt go to a criterium or why i lost the tour
2318991 hes said publicly that there were two events driving him this year the tour de france and the olympic games
2318992 whats happened with cadel coming into these olympic games may have taken him out of being one of the favourites but it may have taken the pressure off him mentally he looks fresh he looks motivated theres no self doubt there
2318993 collection 1 thing implies i totally intend to make more slivers in particular some ideas that should be easy to stat up quickly would be armored slivers giving armor bonuses winged slivers giving flying speeds spiny slivers giving bonus claw damage
2318994 grant can sometimes swim off other people so weve been very intentional about how we want to swim each part of the races and we are being really clear on that and for grant thats the way well race
2318995 he has to swim his race instead of looking where the pack are and that sort of thing
2318996 he has to swim to the plan i havent got to that extent yet
2318997 michael had a bad problem of looking around all the time when he swam so we put some stuff in his goggles
2318998 sure you have to look at the way other people are swimming but were being very intentional about how he wants to swim his race its about being strategic about how we swim the race and sticking to his plan as much as possible
2318999 i think ian thorpe who won the last two 400m gold medals lifted the game in the 400m because he would go out so fast and that has lifted the standard
2319000 but i think this time it will be different it will be very close theres a number of people up towards the front its going to be who can back end the last 150 200m better than the rest
2319001 i think park will probably be the one to beat and hes talking about breaking the world record
2319002 i dont really know where hes at so i cant really make any assessment of that but its a big call to say im going to drop three or four seconds
2319003 ian was in another league the times hes done and no one has got near those times if he does break it awesome fantastic you have to congratulate him if he can go that speed
2319004 im sure grant will be at his best hes had a perfect preparation he was only half a second off his best at the trials and hes improved a lot since trials
2319005 hes just been consistent and his speed is much better leading into this preparation compared to leading into trials
2319006 but i think a key thing is his experience its on his side really hes a great racer and hes confident
2319007 in terms of the 1500m i think it 400m means everything if he knows that his speed is very good because his fitness is fantastic it will just lift his confidence
2319008 he wont be going for silver hell be trying everything he can to swim his race and to swim it his best and if that means a gold medal fantastic

2319016 yeah it is a competition for the spot but we watch film together and we try to learn the intricacies of the game together instead of fighting for the spot all the time

2319018 we are aware that crude prices have dropped but we cant shock the market by responding immediately
2319019 what we do we watch any changes if they grow into a sustainable trend then we respond accordingly in this case if the crude prices continue downward we no doubt cut pump prices
2319020 world oil prices have gone up and in uganda the oil prices have to go up too there is nothing we can do about that and everyone will put his price for the products depending on the cost incurred there is no science about it

2319025 it is full of universal themes such as community caring friendship loss things we can all relate to
2319026 i think the script will make people think about their own life the opportunities they missed the roads not taken that can still be gained
2319027 they have been rehearsing for 3 1 2 weeks and those rehearsals have been going very well
2319028 its always a plus when you get a nice group of talented actors there has been a lot of laughter during rehearsal and a lot of camaraderie has developed among them
2319029 the script and our actors dig well below our preconceived notions of those characters
2319030 there is a lot of depth to each character that will move the audience

2319040 the first time it went around i thought it was a big circus and it was a lot of show but now that peoples houses are getting burned and weird stuff like that these are serious crimes its nerve wracking
2319041 we of course find this very disappointing that the san francisco district attorneys office failed to have this case 100 percent right
2319042 our office has refiled our charges today theyre the same charges and theyll be arraigned tomorrow
2319043 we already wonder how we would ever give her up
2319044 we probably will be talking about this man the rest of our lives
2319045 of course our kids know not to talk or receive things from strangers
2319046 but i saw warmth in his eyes so we walked over to him
2319047 his few words nearly took our breath away because genas fathers name was also alan and he also had a very similar gentle and kind demeanor but her father had passed away six months earlier and still is missed so dearly
2319048 i dont think its a coincidence today that santa cruz means holy cross in spanish

2319079 we had strong product sales in the second quarter driven by an increasing number of large deals including our initial statewide wins
2319080 they lay early for my mother you would too if you knew her
2319081 probably the most memorable wildlife experience was when we went on a boat in the river at hartleys crocodile adventures and saw a crocodile just the hugeness of it was so amazing
2319082 and the kids and the parents were just out of this world
2319083 i learned that if there is anything you want to do heck just try and you can excel

2319090 10 conversations to have at the start of the year
2319091 to me this is much more frieghtening than terrorists from the middle east
2319092 the one in whom we live and move and have our very being
2319093 we went out this offseason and addressed some things we needed
2319094 we had a lot of guys get hurt last year and the young guys really stepped up we have a lot more depth this year
2319095 schobel is a great player so hopefully we can benefit from playing with each other
2319096 i am excited to be here a lot of these guys have taken me under their wing and helped me out
2319097 i feel like this is one of the strongest teams that i have been a part of
2319098 you look at our roster and we dont really have a position that is a weakness we have talented guys all over this roster
2319099 i am always looking to get double digit sacks but i want to see this team win
2319100 you can have great stats but if you dont win then nobody really remembers you
2319101 one thing good guys do is run to the football
2319102 it doesnt matter how good you are or how big you are we want you running to the football it is one of those things that makes a player better
2319103 the people were very excited and happy we were there especially the kids
2319104 our goal was to keep going until we ran out of patients or medicine
2319105 they definitely contributed a lot if people think that they will be secure they will come people were intimidated by the suicide bomber threat so the fact that they showed up was great
2319106 you could see the happiness on the kids faces you could give them the smallest thing like tylenol for their pain and they would smile
2319107 i was nervous because they were yelling i had to take off my kevlar and show them im a female after that i put my kevlar back on and wore a pink scarf around my neck so they would know im a female
2319108 they would say thank you for being here and we want you to come back
2319109 since the women wore so many layers they would make a pouch for all the supplies and load up their dresses with stuff
2319110 one woman would have children and then four to five months later they would die she said please give me something to make my baby stronger the baby was four months old and she was just waiting to see if the baby would make it to the sixth or seventh month
2319111 its heartbreaking to think of it it makes me think about my little nephews and nieces
2319112 the kids loved the mres so they would take those
2319113 i thought it was funny how the kids would stare at us they were intimidated by us at first i remember we went up to one little boy and he ran behind his dad his dad said something to him like dont be scared and then he came out
2319114 he came from herat which is at least 300 kilometers from here
2319115 his family heard about the medcap through word of mouth which is faster than the internet around here the fact that they would drive from herat to delaram just to get medical attention is amazing
2319116 he was severely dehydrated so the corpsman had to inject intravenous fluids into him he walked away with a kool aid smile and a six pack of water bottles
2319117 if they see that we put ourselves in harms way to provide medical attention i think it will also show them were here to help

2319121 the programs all about building a relationship between owner and dog
2319122 we teach the dogs the basics like sit stay and down
2319123 they taught us what we need to do how to call the dog and what technique to use
2319124 by working with owners and their dogs we help keep pets with their people and out of our shelters
2319125 this is the same type of thing we were training for
2319126 everything worked out im glad hes alright thats the good story
2319127 the witnesses that were there said they watched him pull up into a parking spot back out and then make a run for it
2319128 he wasnt acting rational at all he wasnt making any sense
2319129 they just kind of swam him gently over to the landing
2319130 fortunately it turned out there wasnt a big issue with contamination of the water

2319141 rather than face rejection or pay fair value taco bell chose to steal his endorsement and to enjoy all the publicity of being associated with a mega star while bearing none of the costs

2319146 were going against the same defense over and over these days and theyre kind of ready to hit someone new and i think thats the way the rest of the offense feels
2319147 i just really want to see how these young guys react in a game situation picking up things and executing
2319148 hopefully they will have a lot of poise about themselves and conduct themselves well i am excited to see them play
2319149 we will get to see guys we havent seen at this level in an nfl exhibition game which is different than a regular season game
2319150 its probably as fast as any game they will ever play so we get to see the young guys in that situation
2319151 we have a long preseason and we have time to get our guys ready and we try to use it all so that is one thing and then we will get to see the guys under the big lights
2319152 we will know a little bit more after this game
2319153 i really like those guys and i am confident in them but they have to produce we have to see it on the field we will learn a good deal more on saturday and then we will go from there

2319156 however i dont want to count my chickens before they hatch were going to have to stay out of trouble and hope for a big wind
2319157 in order to win we need to finish in the top three in our final two races
2319158 hopefully weve already seen our worst race and can throw that out
2319159 i would love to see bryan and christina not do this
2319160 bryan is the one that got me into this sport in the first place as much as i hope to win it is expected that they will win thursdays races i would say were just a stroke of bad luck for them
2319161 luckily we put in consistent races yesterday the catch is the throw out will change a lot
2319162 it would be great to win the national title here but for the fact that we dont sail our best on this lake
2319163 for some reason there usually is never a strong wind on this lake
2319164 ive sailed with all of them theyre all great competitors and wonderful people
2319165 if the wind is light theyre really hard to beat

2319286 we trusted ubs and paid millions of dollars to them and still have no solution to our credit crisis they turned their back on us just when we needed their support
2319287 when ubs failed to support nhhelcos bonds it failed to support the students and parents in new hampshire
2319288 the relief nhhelco seeks is a letter of credit from ubs which nhhelco can use to ultimately provide access to private and federal loans for students

2319312 many locals like to use sorghum because to them sorghum is kentucky
2319313 for our grandparents especially in the south sorghum was used every day but then it skipped a generation
2319314 sorghum just became too difficult to produce and the workers werent there anymore
2319315 it tastes great on everything from biscuits to pancakes to ice cream and it can be used as a stir fry base in baked beans barbecue sauce and in homemade breads and cookies
2319316 the product is officially called sweet sorghum but over the years theres been some confusion as to what sorghum really is it is often mistaken for molasses
2319317 sorghum however is made from sorghum grass while molasses is made from sugar cane

2319330 the sectors credit strength reflects favorable historical economic conditions and traffic growth in the u s the low elasticity of demand experienced by many toll roads and financial strength and stability of the sector
2319331 the numbers cited there are on all u s highways not just on toll roads
2319332 may have slowed a bit but the usage isnt declining
2319333 theres always that point and that potential that you could be compounding the problem so it is a balancing act

2319342 we are pleased that in two separate patent cases in front of two different itc judges broadcom has prevailed at trial with rulings that support our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property but that we do not infringe theirs
2319343 prior to the itc trials earlier this year we had been optimistic that the companies would be able to cooperatively resolve their differences
2319344 however when that hope diminished we took additional actions to ensure protection of our ip rights we remain open to reaching a mutually acceptable resolution of these disputes

2319367 we welcome the findings of the fsas research on lenders mortgage arrears and lending practices which mirror cab clients experience

2319369 we call on the fsa to take urgent action on the findings of their research if the worst consequences of the deepening mortgage crisis are to be avoided we believe this should involve strengthening the rules on mortgage arrears and lending practices

2319400 but it is inevitable that more borrowers coping strategies will come under pressure in current conditions than in the unusually benign years of the last decade thats why lenders government and the advice sector are working closely together to minimise the impact on borrowers

2319404 seeing the islands on tv makes me want to go there even more its so beautiful there all i need is two weeks to travel to maui waikiki oahu and maybe the big island just two weeks but dressing up like a hula dancer was fun in a way it satisfied a daydream i had it made me feel in a way that i was taking part in a hawaiian show at a hotel in waikiki if i ever get to hawaii and they pull me up on stage during a hotel show im going to wiggle better than one of their own girls can a girl can still fantasize cant she

2319409 i think i like them about the same pussy was my first love so no matter how many guys i fuck i will never lose my lezzie tendencies sometimes i just get a craving to smell and eat a juicy twat but i also really like it when a guy with a giant pecker sticks it deep in my pussy it feels better than when a girl fucks me with a dildo nothing compares to the real thing

2319415 the current uncertainty surrounding base rate decisions and the general uncertainties on the market at the moment are clearly feeding through into consumers views on mortgages however in times of uncertainty people want security and nearly half of all borrowers saying theyd choose to fix if they remortgaged tomorrow most choosing a three year deal
2319416 given the demand for this length of deal abbey recently expanded the three year range with two low fee choices abbey also has a market leading three year fix at 5 99 per cent with 1 695 fee for those who want to keep monthly payments to a minimum

2319424 my show comes on at a good time on the west coast and a time for cottagers and insomniacs and shift workers on the east coast
2319425 im the one host whos on the air from noon onward in beijing when sports are going on live so we will be taking the opportunity to be showing a lot of sporting events live in canadian terms for the rowing and paddling events the heats and the finals are going to be happening right in the middle of our time
2319426 i was completely taken by surprise within about 10 days to two weeks we had a couple of meetings and the assignment was nailed down it happened relatively late and very quickly
2319427 ive never done anything like this as exciting as that is i have to say as it draws closer im getting a little bit nervous about it just trying to anticipate what i need to do to prepare and what i dont know im not really going to know until i get on the air on that first day what i should have done im reading thinking about it and just looking forward to getting on the air and getting going
2319428 you adjust in terms of making sure your audience knows what restrictions youre under if youre under restrictions you do the best job you can in terms of reporting
2319429 to be fair at the olympics that ive been to in countries that are completely democratic and purport to be completely free notably the united states both in atlanta and salt lake city you still are under tremendous restrictions theres a tendency in lots of countries to clamp down when you feel like you can and if that happens in the states were bracing ourselves to see whats going to happen when were out and about in china
2319430 i guess to an extent weve gotten over it it was shocking for all of us when we heard the announcement especially given that 2010 is going to be in canada
2319431 i dont hear people talk about that a lot i certainly know personally theres enough both exciting and anxiety inducing to think about in terms of getting ready for these games that i dont think much about the fact that its cbcs last games for a while

2319442 in recent weeks many lenders have announced cuts in their mortgage rates leading to many people predicting that we may have turned that corner
2319443 during the last month the average fee has increased by nearly 100 meaning that borrowers have not benefitted as much from a reduction as expected
2319444 on a 150k repayment mortgage a 100 increase in fee equates to an additional 0 06 increase in the rate therefore in real terms a customer has only benefitted from a net 0 09 reduction in the average rate as opposed to the full 0 15
2319445 research conducted by moneyfacts co uk has shown that some lenders have increased rates and fees and not brought either back down other lenders have reduced rates but increased fees some lenders have switched from charging a fixed monetary fee to offering a percentage fee
2319446 on a positive note swap rates have continued to fall and are now at their lowest level since 13 april predictions are that we should see further decreases in fixed rates from high street lenders before too long
2319447 we are dissatisfied with the lack of technology in the classroom
2319448 it is of no little significance that all of jesus pronouncements on the final judgement doctrinal correctness seems to play little if any significant role in the fate of the person standing before the judge judging from the teaching of our lord himself the pertinent criteria hs to do with personal qualities and relational behavior as summarized in the sermon on the mount
2319449 there are three that bear witness the spirit the water and the blood and these three are one
2319450 the formal doctrine of the trinity as it was defined by the great church councils of the fourth and fifth centuries is not to be found in the new testament
2319451 the son of god became man that we might become god
2319452 of pertaining to believing in or belonging to a religion based on the teachings of jesus christ
2319453 there is no regularly constituted church of christ on earth nor any person qualified to administer any church ordinances nor can there be until new apostles are sent by the great head of the church for whose coming i am seeking
2319454 nor can a christian believer be forced beyond sacred scriptures unless some new and proved revelation should be added for we are forbidden by divine law to believe except what is proved either through the divine scriptures or through manifest revelation
2319455 i have sought nothing beyond reforming the church in conformity with the holy scriptures the spiritual powers have been not only corrupted by sin but absolutely destroyed so that there is now nothing in them but a depraved reason and a will that is the enemy and opponent of god i simply say that christianity has ceased to exist among those who should have preserved it
2319456 we consider it a source of shame that the united nations routinely passes more human rights sic resolutions against israel than any other nation in the world
2319457 in the end of days all nations of the world will gather against jerusalem
2319458 they could not take away the spirit of the jewish people and they could not break the promise of god

2319463 this gift is absolutely essential to the university systems mission of education research and public service
2319464 weve had a 30 million request to the state legislature for increased broadband capacity for the last several years but unfortunately it didnt receive the support it needed in this digital age the university must have a competitive level of network capacity its central to what we do

2319467 it sets a wonderful example of generosity that will benefit many scientists and elementary through university students across the state

2319469 the gift agreement includes a research component where the university and gci will explore working together on solving connectivity challenges that still persist particularly in rural alaska

2319514 he always had this little mischievous grin on him and a little twinkle in his eyes that always made you wonder what he was up to
2319515 he was a very curious energetic young man he was very athletic and i would say that he was a little more of a risk taker especially on the playground
2319516 he looked like an athlete even at that age he didnt have to do any extra laps for shenanigans
2319517 he stood out as a kid that had a lot of potential

2319532 this afternoon eric feltner a former member of my staff is pleading guilty to class a misdemeanor charges in cole county court
2319533 it is my hope that this case will serve as a deterrent for others who would prey on children via the internet and make it clear that there is a zero tolerance policy in state government for this kind of disgusting behavior
2319534 this zero tolerance policy is unwavering which is why i was extremely troubled to learn that rep scott muschany is facing felony charges for sexual assault of a minor this alleged misconduct is reprehensible and cannot and will not be tolerated
2319535 today i call on my fellow republican leaders to join me in calling for rep muschanys immediate resignation from the missouri house
2319536 our public leaders republican and democrat are not above the law and must be held accountable for their actions the people of the great state of missouri demand it

2319544 it was one of those situations where i tried to do too much
2319545 it just seems right now that things are not going our way
2319546 weve got to keep fighting through it until they do
2319547 he mixed his pitches he worked quick he looked confident all the things youd want to see from a young guy
2319548 as soon as i walked out there it was a beautiful stadium it took a moment to sink in that i was actually here
2319549 after that when it was a hitters count he wasnt just throwing fastballs

2319601 the media continue down the road of peddling the political cynicism that all georgians and all americans are tired of
2319602 i felt closer to the coaching staff there and i have some friends on that team
2319603 for me i felt like i needed to get out of the state and get away
2319604 imla strongly contests the suggestion made by the fsa that all specialist lenders systemically operate a one size fits all approach to arrears management
2319605 as our third quarter results illustrate difficult operating conditions in the homebuilding industry persist
2319606 based on these demand dynamics coupled with high supply levels of new and existing home inventory we believe industry conditions will remain challenging for the remainder of this fiscal year and as we enter fiscal 2009
2319607 we are excited that gos 3 gadgets can introduce small applications for small laptops by connecting with the google gadgets for linux platform and its vast application database
2319608 with this version of gos we are delivering a linux that is ready for consumers a linux for the rest of us
2319609 we are pleased that gos is working with the lxde community to achieve faster boot time and response
2319610 we think gos will be even better for consumer netbooks and nettops with some of lxdes enhancements

2319613 we have residents that have lived in atherton more than 40 years along the tracks
2319614 a lot of the concern is that the authoritys board wasnt given accurate information about the relative impacts of the two alignments
2319615 the staff of the high speed rail authority i dont know if id say they cooked the books but they tilted things very strongly to make it look like the peninsula alignment had a lot less impact than it does
2319616 we will work to recover that recorder but we cant guarantee its condition because of the extensive fire damage and that may unfortunately limit its usefulness
2319617 he felt responsible for making a difference in this world
2319618 at the moment and at this level there is no movement within opec to do anything
2319619 i dont think ministers will change output i think at less than 80 for opec oil maybe they would do something
2319620 we are just right now concentrating on all the families and our employees
2319621 we are very concerned about them because we are very tight knit
2319622 im so thankful because hes just lucky to be alive
2319623 you cant be in a crash like that and not hurt
2319624 its quite possible to envision that the case for a slowing down in diversification into sterling will be pretty strong over the next year
2319625 if you continue to see weakness in the uk theres every reason to assume that central banks will start to pull back in sterling a bit

2319627 the approximate 3 year old is in surgery at childrens hospital in oakland as of about 4 p m
2319628 a girl about 13 years old came out running yelling he
2319629 we did not fire him we just did not renew his contract the issue is his bad working relationship with the players he also treats players differently we decided were not going anywhere with him
2319630 this years going to go a lot better because were a lot more together and a lot more positive
2319631 im confident with our kids and our coaching staff that we can get right back on track
2319632 i think that people are doubting us because of our size
2319633 but then again we got heart and thats all that matters in a football game
2319634 he lost all his baby fat and became a man
2319635 this year were focused on the coaches and the coaches are focused on us
2319636 hell probably make a pretty big impact on our varsity
2319637 we got so many athletes in this school that specialize
2319638 if more of them played football we could make this school something to reckon with but they want to be their own little specialized guy so we just take what we get deal with it and we do the best that we can
2319639 we got better as a team we grew as a team
2319640 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
2319641 hes had a lot of preparation on and off the field
2319642 division 1 caliber speed a great team leader who never gets rattled
2319643 ive worked really hard in physical therapy to be ready for this season
2319644 taxpayers should let the governor know that this is not a proper way to balance the budget
2319645 we put together our budget knowing that the general assembly had approved homeowner tax relief grants for another year
2319646 itll be january before we know for sure whether were getting that 1 8 million
2319647 for the average homeowner because the state has elected not to keep its promise its very likely that property owners will be asked to pay for this in their taxes
2319648 i have had lasik surgery and have been wearing lasik lenses which have a hard center and flatten out at the end
2319649 i had got some infection in there and my doctor said that i needed to let my eyes rest by keeping the contacts out
2319650 he gave me cortisone and steroids which were very painful and it was annoying and difficult to be to trying to fight a tough golf course and have my eye aggravating me at the same time
2319651 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way
2319652 at such an hour a dead person is to be raised to life
2319653 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life

2319657 in 2003 the corpses of dozens of elderly parisians among 15 000 victims of a heat wave languished in city morgues because their families chose not to interrupt their beach getaways for the funerals
2319658 the 8 8 08 double prosperity set presents a once in a lifetime opportunity for coin collectors and the general public the date 8 8 08 august 8 2008 occurs only once every 100 years to mark this occasion this is also the first time the united states mint has paired two gold coins in custom designed packaging making this set a unique product for the asian american community
2319659 faced with a weak economy and increasing energy costs many mainers are having a tough time making ends meet
2319660 the purpose of these rebate checks was to get people to spend more money and when they spend their payments here in maine that will help our local economy
2319661 most of these people are seniors who are not required to file for any reason other than to get their stimulus payment so they may not realize they qualify and because they may not have filed a tax return in decades they may find the process intimidating
2319662 we need to get the word out that people have until oct 15 to claim the payment and that they can get help in applying
2319663 many of the seniors who havent filed yet are home bound and may need special assistance
2319664 family members and friends should check in with the seniors they know to make sure theyre aware they can qualify for the payment and get the help they need

2319670 the state has put in place a homestead exemption of 8 000 which reduces the property tax revenue that the county receives the homeowners tax relief grant is the states initiative to reduce the property tax and they reimburse us hall county for that lost revenue
2319671 if they dont reimburse us for the lost revenue then theres two options either we have to reduce our budget and somehow come up with the 2 5 million to balance the budget or we would have to send out a second tax bill whenever that happened to recover the money and balance the budget
2319672 its a challenging time for all of us its a trying time but well survive
2319673 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
2319674 i will be doing a red carpet look that still reflects the simple classic design of the lauren conrad collection but with a black tie twist
2319675 i dont believe in reality tv stars turning into designers
2319676 seems to be actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently painting it in a negative light
2319677 fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the imprimatur of acceptability by the television industry
2319678 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalogue fresh for new and existing fans
2319679 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
2319680 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
2319681 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
2319682 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
2319683 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it
2319684 we will take whatever investigative steps are necessary to bring this to a conclusion
2319685 the risk to gilts certainly appears higher than in the euro zone at the moment
2319686 people are starting to price this in but there is probably a lot further to go
2319687 are the two members who couldnt even serve in the guard
2319688 hes probably got the most corporate memory right now of anybody on the budget
2319689 i came to sacramento to get things done and thats what my focus is and at the same time i really love people and have worked hard to build relationships
2319690 obviously from a philosophical perspective theres a bit of a distance between us but he has the ability to disagree without being disagreeable and is eminently fair in his approach to policy discussions
2319691 ive never seen john playing politics for the sake of politics
2319692 hes an honest person whos going to give you the straightforward perspective
2319693 john is easily one of the best politicians in the history of santa cruz
2319694 he not only takes on multibillion dollar structural deficits in california but also is willing to engage in issues like whether off leash dogs can continue to use the beach here in santa cruz

2319699 i am shocked about the muschany story and feel very sad for each of the families affected i can not comprehend such behavior it is intolerable if the cole county grand jury allegations are true muschany should be prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of missouri law including prison right now we are trying to get all the facts including a copy of the indictment

2319706 i just need to set an example and work hard so others will follow
2319707 my responsibility is a lot bigger and i think can make an impact on both sides of the ball
2319708 but we have a pretty tough region and we have more of a target on our back i dont that we should be worrying about that the state title game
2319709 i just really want to get my education paid for any scholarship i want to have a great senior year so i will have an opportunity
2319710 but right now im just looking forward to getting ready for our first game
2319711 like anybody else i dont think our expectation is any different from other teams in the state
2319712 i went over a few stats today and found that when the market more specifically the s amp p 500 spy is higher before and after the fomc release the often performs poorly over the short term since 1998 the market has only witnessed this type of scenario seven times and the following day only two occurrences pushed higher and only by a paltry amount a week later all seven instances were lower by an average of approximately 1 i have mentioned several times about the tendency for a post fed fade and at least over the short term my sentiment sides with the historical statistics however i would not be surprised to see a gap higher tomorrow that officially pushes the major benchmarks i follow into a short term overbought state this would also test the recent highs in all of the major benchmarks which should act as a decent area of overhead resistance just look at the charts for spy dia iwm and qqqq over the past few weeks if this scenario does occur we could see a trigger in all three strategies it has never happened before but that certainly doesnt mean that it is out of the question several of the sectors 5 out of 10 that i follow have also pushed into a short term overbought state health care xlv has pushed into a short term very overboguht state and my shortest term proprietary indicator is nearing an extreme state this is just another reason why i think a fade or pullback is likely over the short term
2319713 what youd need to do to really answer this question is take a load of kids at a really young age stick them in front of loads of inappropriate games that are for adults and older kids and let them play them over a sustained period of time and controlling all other lifestyle factors then seeing what happens thats ludicrous its unethical it should never happen the methodology that is needed you just couldnt do

2319717 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
2319718 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
2319719 i realized the battle was already lost that we were deluding ourselves if we felt we could force this kid to do anything in school it was only a question of whether we were going to lose him as well
2319720 he wasnt like some belligerent sullen kid he was a great sunny guy who happened to hate high school he was ill served by going to school he likes to talk and he likes to watch movies so i thought lets give the guy something to do that gives him pleasure and see where he goes
2319721 i worried i was making use of him as an example of my own hipness
2319722 there was something that flattered my vanity about this decision to let him drop out of school and watch movies
2319723 if he hadnt done something like that he wouldnt have been my dad i think that three years we spent together formed me as a person
2319724 i dont think you necessarily learn life lessons from films i think the only life lessons you learn are from knocking yourself around and actually living but wed have conversations that sprang out of these films i did learn from that things guys need to talk about heartbreak and drugs and all that it happened to be movies but it could have been something else my dad and i did i think it was more about us spending time together

2319728 the goal is to teach them skills that will help them survive in their community

2319730 they have to know whats out there so they can make a choice for themselves

2319732 i met a friend who made me realize that you should be glad every day that youre alive and make the most of it thats a powerful message
2319733 i started wondering why i was living at all then i remembered the stuff from the training
2319734 coming back here really helped me get a perspective on my life
2319735 i realized im not the only one with problems and i didnt have it as bad as a lot of people
2319736 energy has been pretty beaten down here over the last three weeks but i wouldnt say its time to pass the baton just yet
2319737 to expect that its all over for energy and energy stocks i think is premature i think weve seen more of a swing in the trade than a move based on fundamentals were just getting a correction in a very broad advance in the price of oil

2319743 there were several inadequacies in the college which would not allow students to benefit completely from the course
2319744 we have written to the health ministry and they have sent a team to observe the university
2319745 we have also submitted a report and the matter is still pending and hope to get a reply within two to three weeks

2319754 markbahner said that the probability of warming less than 1 4c was 50 and the probability of warming greater than 5c was zero
2319755 the simple fact is that there is approximately a 50 50 chance that the warming will be less than 1 4 deg c and there is virtually no chance far less than 1 percent that the warming will be over 5 deg c
2319756 ipcc did not assign a probability to the 1 4 5 8c range it was recognized that to so may have been useful but it was beyond the state of the science insofar as ipcc can only review the science not do new science
2319757 so sarah raper and i did the appropriate probabilistic calculations we found that there was a non zero probability of warming less than 1 4c and a non zero but smaller probability of warming above 5 8c you can estimate the probabilities from the above cited paper we found the 90 c i to be 1 68c to 4 87c

2319763 the device is safe from hackers because it only reads information and does not send any
2319764 outside of a faithful marriage between a man and a woman there is no safe sex
2319765 it is irresponsible to teach people that you can have safe sex or safer sex outside of marriage
2319766 it is undeniable that safe sex works and has saved the lives of millions of people
2319767 contrary to focus on the familys death promoting dogma there is no hiv crisis for gay or straight men who practice the very safe sex techniques that they have irresponsibly dismissed furthermore how is a gay man in a relationship any more at risk than a heterosexual man in a relationship focus on the familys propaganda defies science logic and common sense
2319768 right wingers should learn about condoms too so when they cheat on their spouses they do so safely and not bring stds into the home
2319769 this is particularly true in bible belt states which have the in the nation it is never helpful to promote ignorance over education and that is precisely the sex education paradigm embraced by focus on the family

2319799 ive been trying to tell people for years that their idea of a homeless person in their mind is the person whos on the street whos dirty and maybe drug addicted
2319800 that style and maybe the mentally handicapped homeless is only about 20 person of the homeless population the ordinary people who are just like you and me are the majority we have really decent people who stay in our shelter theyre just down on their luck

2319814 despite recent losses theres been an 89 percent increase in the value of homes in the state from 1998 to 2008
2319815 thats a 6 6 percent average increase per year its a flawed premise to look at the market short term
2319816 long term investment in real estate is still a sound choice
2319817 we do not have the numbers of unsold speculative properties developments like we did back then

2319844 while wealth is created by private economic transactions if an unregulated good is used as part of the economic process is some public wealth also destroyed
2319845 do market prices the cost of release of ghgs dumping at 0
2319846 does the absence of a market signal tend to encourage economic behavior that has destructive aspects because actors have no incentive to rationalize their use of the resource or to take into account damages that may result to others from such activity
2319847 is this similar to a subsidy of current consumption taken from future generations extracted by means of impoverishing unowned common resources
2319848 are there true costs to using the global commons in this way in looking at this please consider the conclusion that there is a discernible climate change and a discernable human fingerprint on it that temps have only risen one degree but climate sensitivity appears to be about 5 f in the event of a doubling besides considering the costs imposed by climate change through its ecological effects direct damage to human assets and activities and possible benefits please also consider the costs of adapting infrastructure to the changes consider both costs already felt and those that can be anticipated and discounted
2319849 in the absence of a pricing mechanism via private ownership of emission permits taxation or other device that values the use of the atmosphere as a ghg dump what market incentives do fossil fuel providers or consumers have to move to new technologies that economize on ghg emissions
2319850 presumably you have no problem with purely private transactions between economic actors involving resources and products owned by them neither do i so long as i can also sue for any damages they might cause me but the externalities associated with certain behaviors has led to regulation including establishing private property rights in the case of so2 emissions what is so conceptually different about establishing similar transferrable property rights in ghjg emissions
2319851 regarding future energy sources im not up to date on fusion research but im curious why you havent mentioned next generation fission systems to tide us over until we get a little further down the road

2319853 through the media weve been informed at this point the governor is placing on hold these grants that have about a 6 million impact on our community
2319854 if its not paid for by the state as it has been in the past its got to be made up by some local tax dollars what this money is for is to help roll back our property taxes without it weve got an additional hole in the budget were going to have to look at
2319855 that 6 million is total between us and the schools but its unfortunate the states going to try to balance their budget woes on the back of the localities
2319856 and its not only here but its every locality in the state
2319857 we are currently working with the governors office to determine the options for counties
2319858 it would have to be very drastic for us to consider that a millage increase
2319859 what we need now are feeder hospitals level ii and iii hospitals
2319860 we need to double the number of those hospitals because right now we have some areas where patients are 100 miles from the nearest trauma center

2319867 i wanted to use it as a symbol to dominate the space and to be intimidating almost to let people going through customs know that these are the people that have the authority to protect our borders our waterways and our airways so ive used it as a symbol of power and dominance and when you see it youll get that impression
2319868 after the milking in the summer you had to hope like hell you could survive the rugby match on the lawn you had to sidestep the tree and you had to have 180 degree vision so you knew where the fence was and the house otherwise it was tackle not touch that was how they all developed their skills
2319869 what the report does show and what ive been telling people is that working for families has been making a difference because it has lifted the working poor primarily out of that situation and has helped families whove got dependent children weve got the flow on effects to come through yet from the 1 april changes last year which i think will further improve the lot of benefit dependent families
2319870 theres also this neo reactionary or new right wing historian who sort of goes back into the past albeit trying to be objective but nevertheless falls into the trap of repeating those same victorian sorts of eurocentric perceptions of maori society and my concerns on reading the book so far is thats what professor moon does
2319871 the urupas on the other side if the harbour from where sonnys marae was so they didnt know what the tides were at the time as it was we had to get sonny in the ground by 10am so people were turning up during and after the event so this will be a way of sending him off properly it will be groovy
2319872 there is no challenge to that determination there is absolutely not process to include any provisions for natural justice principles legislative of otherwise there is absolutely no determination as to what that tikanga process is so we have absolutely no idea what process or tikanga is going to be used to determine the mana whenua
2319873 bit stereotyping to suggest we should look for maori at the warehouse and burger king and mcdonalds what about the gyms why arent we at the rugby clubs i know there is a very active waka ama group in gisborne why are we not down at the waka ama club

2319890 they are lovely boats and we love being out there you might not think it but it is a very competitive class and some of the younger guys are hopeful that they might topple rupert one day
2319891 it was quite tense because we were in 5th place at the first mark and if we had stayed there we would not have won overall
2319892 we have taken this very seriously we are professional sailors so treated it as part of our training programme and feel that we made a clear progression it has been a fantastic regatta and we are really pleased to have won
2319893 the crew are pretty disappointed but it was all my fault
2319894 my tactician advised me not to put it up because we were in the lead and only needed to stay in front of amey love shack to win the overall prize but i wanted to put it up for a bit of fun
2319895 this was not in the plan at all but it is very exciting
2319896 if they win tomorrow and we come second we win overall if they win and we come third they win overall if we win we win

2319898 montgomery co referendum seen as guide to nixing transgender laws in u s
2319899 theres no strategy theres just similar concerns among people in montgomery county maryland colorado and gainesville florida where theyre also facing a referendum on a similar law
2319900 this is precisely what the transgender community ultimately wants to open up bathrooms locker rooms across the country
2319901 the partnership scheme was such a great success here on the island and i am glad our work is being used as a beacon to encourage guide and assist other local authorities in using laas to solve problems within their communities
2319902 the nightbus scheme continues to be a great success on the island and we enjoy a closer working relationship with the police and southern vectis as a result of our work on this particular scheme
2319903 the success of this scheme demonstrates what can be achieved when we work together violence and damage reduced in two of the three areas and people can travel home safely
2319904 our participation in the scheme has been a tremendous accomplishment bringing us closer ties with the police the isle of wight council and other local organisations to promote safer travel for our customers
2319905 she seems very pleased with how far the alliance had come

2319916 theyre probably the wealthiest family in town they made their money from grapes i think but theres a lot of wealthy people around here its one of the richest towns in australia
2319917 its classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down this syndicate
2319918 we are part of a european and australian attempt to shut this syndicate down what i can tell you is that this is part of a global international syndicate this is a major disruption to trans national organised crime both in this country and abroad
2319919 the fact that a syndicate can sit back after importing 4 4 tonnes of narcotics and can continue to operate is something that seizes the minds of investigators and has focused our work over the 12 months or so
2319920 amongst 3000 of those tins that were opened we discovered 4 4 tonnes of ecstasy tablets
2319921 this is a very sophisticated concealment even to the extent of adding stones to some of the containers to give them the same weight of a tin of tomatoes
2319922 in the second case it was much less sophisticated the container was carrying bags of coffee beans and thrown on top were three vinyl bags which will be alleged contained the cocaine
2319923 the volume of the seizure indicates that international syndicates saw australia as a potentially fertile market we hope that impression has well and truly been smashed
2319924 one benefit of this seizure is to send a very clear message to these drug syndicates that australia is not a soft target that our law enforcement authorities are as good or if not better than any in the world and they smugglers face very serious criminal consequences
2319925 i dont want to speak on behalf of the town i dont really know much about what happened today but it seems to be the same names that keep coming up if someone had a serious dig around here i think it would uncover some pretty interesting stuff
2319926 weve had our fair share of criticism and the towns reputation has been tarnished since the death of don mckay we need to send a clear message that this type of activity is unacceptable and these people need to be driven out of town
2319927 in the 70s it was a traditional calabrian mafia its now prepared to business with anyone
2319928 back then it wouldve been unthinkable for them to go into business with a bikie group

2319948 im sorry but i dont see the point of this at all presumably the predictions need to be made by a certain point in time say december 31 2007 and then the prizes will be paid out on december 31 2031 the cost would be whatever the cost of 400 million face in zero coupon 2031 bonds is lets say 100 million what do you get for your 100 million a set of 100 predictions
2319949 i suppose at that point you can take the average prediction and compare it to the ipcc prediction
2319950 lets say that the average prediction turns out to be more bearish than the ipcc prediction would you then say that the us govt should jump onto the ipcc bandwagon
2319951 your idea is great plus each prediction should present its annual time series predicted value leading to the 2029 2031 target window the contest sponsor then would post actual empirical measures compared to each annual predicted value so that we all could evaluste the likely out come by trand analysis before 2033 when the final empirical measures would be available
2319952 i would suggest that we also add several forecasts through time starting in 2010 i would then open the prize to all comers who submit models that can be reviewed
2319953 i think this idea can really be refined to address many of the problems associated with it but it is a brilliant starting point
2319954 whereas the ipcc sres process is trying to make best estimates of future emission scenarios in the absence of any explicit climate policy
2319955 and indeed it makes it hard to use the best estimate via your method for climate policy purposes
2319956 again i need to do some more thinking over memorial day but right now id say theres probably at least a 50 50 chance that all energy in 2100 will come from sources like photovoltaics and fusion

2319963 zijn er veel christenen die er in geloofszaken een afwijkende mening op na kunnen houden
2319964 hun overheid ambt is niet alleen acht te nemen en te waken over de politie staatsbestuur maar ook de hand te houden aan den heiligen kerkedienst om te weren en uit te roeien alle afgoderij en valsen godsdienst om het rijk van den antichrist te gronde te werpen en het koninkrijk van jezus christus te doen vorderen het woord des evangelies overal te doen prediken opdat god van een iegelijk ge erd en gediend worde gelijk hij in zijn woord gebiedt
2319965 daarbij gaat het om nadrukkelijke binding van de overheid aan de eerste tafel van de wet van god de taak van de kerk om de overheid voor te lichten en te weren van godslasterlijke uitingen van het publieke domein van de samenleving
