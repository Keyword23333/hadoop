5710213 its excellent for these guys to get a chance to come play and do something different were planning on expanding it next year
5710214 when i started it mike set it up for the art walk
5710215 i let him leave them there and he sold one or two of them it looks great and the theme works with the store
5710216 weve had discussions with the chamber of commerce and virginia marti college of art and design
5710217 were working with the alumni foundation to restore and preserve all of these murals
5710218 the first mural was done by david deming who is now the president of the cleveland institute of art
5710219 thats so people can say wow people are involved in art
5710220 unfortunately schools cut art based programs first there is a lot of talent in the community
5710221 buy your family a present right off the wall while eating lunch
5710222 sip into the holidays is a fabulous fundraiser for the commission on aging
5710223 i feel this is a place for artists to come
5710224 i am very excited about the response and support that has been shown so far from cleveland plays the h2o program the high school and the community pairing together a simple 5k with a focus on greening our schools appears to be a solid match the time seems right and people are ready to get involved
5710225 lakewood has a lot of places to eat wings and a lot of people who would appreciate the opportunity to see whats available
5710226 30 or so places that serve wings and 52 000 people within 6 square miles why not put them all together and use the proceeds to benefit everyone
5710227 i think its fantastic that we have 11 locations that have already donated wings for this event and opened their doors to us
5710228 what is the definition of analytics is it purely a calculation or something else
5710229 a simple and practical definition however would be how an entity i e business arrives at an optimal or realistic decision based on existing data
5710230 common applications of analytics include the study of business data using statistical analysis in order to discover and understand historical patterns with an eye to predicting and improving business performance in the future also some people use the term to denote the use of mathematics in business others hold that field of analytics include the use of operations research statistics and probability however it would be erroneous to limit the field of analytics to only statistics and mathematics
5710231 this ceremony kicked off the final stage of a three year journey
5710232 once complete the renovated units will provide a more patient friendly environment featuring advanced technology to enhance the expert level of care that is delivered to patients every day
5710233 the updated critical care units will enable us to better care for patients now and into the future
5710234 we worked closely with staff and physicians to create a design that will complement the high level of care they provide once the renovations are complete the staff can concentrate on what they do best which is putting patients first
5710235 dit is een heel gelukkige dag voor de hele natie
5710236 de belangrijkste hinderpaal op de weg naar de democratie in pakistan is verwijderd
5710237 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
5710238 dit is een heel gelukkige dag voor de hele natie
5710239 de belangrijkste hinderpaal op de weg naar de democratie in pakistan is verwijderd
5710240 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
5710241 de kanker heeft zich niet verspreid ze hebben alles weggehaald dus ik zal zeker niet sterven aan borstkanker
5710242 alle vrouwen rond de bridgetafel zullen jaloers op me zijn
5710243 nadat ik alle mogelijke behandelingen bekeken had was de enige die voor mij het meest logisch leek de dubbele masectomie
5710244 its a big resource its got a good cost curve and its not getting enough attention
5710245 the plus side of the new system is that it gets a lot of kids into research
5710246 the minus is that it removes the part we did that was most interesting use our imaginations to dream up a project and figure out how to work it out
5710247 if you see it i think youll agree that all the touchy humor is in context and in no way mean spirited or irresponsible
5710248 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5710249 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5710250 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5710251 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5710252 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5710253 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5710254 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5710255 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into take care of business mode which was i asked them what do i do now
5710256 it is significant that our first social marketing campaign will launch during national suicide prevention week because suicide is one of the top three killers of all young people and lgbtq youth are up to four times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers
5710257 it is time for young people to rise above homophobia and work together to create inclusive respectful environments for one another
5710258 no more left or right time for a new catholic action
5710259 preacher man barack obama and the the gospel of liberalism
5710260 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
5710261 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
5710262 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
5710263 poverty is a failure of community but religious newfoundlanders and labradorians believe deeply in the values of community
5710264 thats why we are calling on candidates of all parties to pledge that they will strive to end the injustice of poverty in a wealthy nation
5710265 the sad fact is that economic inequality is growing and human beings are suffering needlessly
5710266 governments silence on the future of the mill is of growing concern
5710267 i have to question how engaged government actually is on this file and whether their silence indicates approval for any planned restructuring that may take place
5710268 county commissioner pete gerken said the new partnerships made him more likely to support the levy
5710269 it doesnt look like a retread of what didnt work before
5710270 so far the levy campaign has raised 220 000 according to lori hauser cosis director of operations

5710272 hey consumer were giving you a bum deal because you have bum credit
5710273 the terms offered to you may be less favorable than the terms offered to consumers who have better credit histories
5710274 given that credit cards are loans the basic interest fee is enough but when they use factors that are beyond my control for changing the terms of my account i feel used
5710275 i believe that the board did an excellent job of addressing how to effectively implement this difficult section of the fact act to be both beneficial to consumers and avoid excessive burden on lenders
5710276 this proposed amendment will be very expensive and cumbersome to comply with we have enough cumbersome things to do that are more beneficial to the consumers without adding another that would probably wipe out an entire rain forest
5710277 overall the notice requirements will increase loan origination costs due to system programming changes notice creation and printing record retention requirements and postage consumers are better educated than when the law was passed they now have the ability to obtain a free annual credit report and understand their credit score is a factor in determining which interest rate they receive
5710278 is supposed to predict how well you will be able to pay back debt please tell me how a number can gaurantee life doesnt happen
5710279 these companies are slowly sucking the blood out of every taxpayer in the nation
5710280 el llamado diario es a la acci n para ayudar a los dem s todos los ni os que he conocido que viven en la extrema pobreza tienen sue os de convertirse en maestros o m dicos o abogados y todos sabemos que la educaci n es la clave para revelar el talento de los ni os y es un poderoso instrumento para romper el ciclo de la pobreza
5710281 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5710282 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5710283 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5710284 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies
5710285 should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period
5710286 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of
5710287 the most memorable moments in television history will be revealed during the 60th primetime emmy awards next month and its up to voters to decide which bits should take top honors
5710288 lots of shows not just news are recording all time lows because of the continued fragmentation of viewing choices and in some cases due to dvr time shifting
5710289 so to me the only proper name i could come up with was buddy because he was my buddy
5710290 he was there for me and i was there for him
5710291 i always wanted to name a dog jesus because its different and it catches peoples attention
5710292 they tell me to call him hey zeus its the same thing its only said differently
5710293 if we dont have any policies on what we name our children i would think government could not mandate what we name our dogs and cats
5710294 lately i have heard some really weird names for children and they will have a longer life span than our animals to carry it
5710295 and of course they want to know where did that name come from so then i have to tell the story
5710296 i wanted to change it because its such a dumb name and shes a girl
5710297 but im thinking it might have been hard for her to get used to a different name
5710298 for me it was the city i grew up in jackson
5710299 and then the other probably more fun story is that my wife if we had a boy she wanted to name the son jackson
5710300 allerdings muss man sich als kapit n der mannschaft nicht in diesem ma e und mit solchen ausdr cken abreagieren

5710302 coal burning leaves toxic heavy metal legacy in the arctic
5710303 conventional wisdom held that toxic heavy metals were higher in the 1960s and 70s the peak of industrial activity in europe and north america and certainly before implementation of clean air act controls in the early 1970s
5710304 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies
5710305 contamination of other sectors may be increasing because of the rapid coal driven growth of asian economies
5710306 impacts on human health in the arctic region havent been determined
5710307 we were disappointed with our performance at e3 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased
5710308 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo
5710309 its primarily meant to set aside land thats less productive or has other environmental benefits
5710310 theres very little prime farmland that goes into this program
5710311 the tiny particles hold moisture between them its hard for water to get through
5710312 im just so proud of myself i crossed the line and just thought oh my goodness
5710313 its hard but my coach has always taught me you have to go in to each race expecting to win
5710314 if tax levels and taxpayer responsibilities arent balanced to promote economic development companies may not choose to locate here or stay here
5710315 and no one wants to see hoosiers out of work or businesses going elsewhere
5710316 weve taken the positive steps of eliminating the inventory tax and corporate gross receipts tax and making permanent the venture capital tax credit still we must build on these efforts in order to better compete for job expansion and relocation especially with the economy now tightening across the country
5710317 the governors property tax plan from last session contained many positive policies to aid citizens and businesses alike but we remain concerned about the1 2 3 property caps on tax bills that allow different types of property to be taxed unequally
5710318 we believe the current constitutional guarantee of uniform and equal assessments and taxation is the correct approach our fear is that once business property is constitutionally allowed to be singled out for unequal property tax treatment there will be no going back
5710319 it then makes it much easier for future general assemblies to widen the disparity between homes and businesses as has occurred in other states with property classification when they feel the pressure to allow local governments to generate new revenues but dont want to burden homeowners
5710320 we are living in a year of new beginnings and the lord is pouring out his spirit in a mighty way we are seeing miracles healings and glorious salvations throughout the world
5710321 god is bringing new resurrection life to his people and to all people who have a hunger and thirst after him renewal restoration and revival are at hand

5710324 where other midwest metropolitan cities have struggled in a challenging national economy indianapolis continues to shine with economic development in our urban communities
5710325 for more than 75 years weve been a resident a steward and an independent provider of insurance products to a diverse clientele
5710326 with city support for real property tax abatement the decision to maintain our headquarters in downtown indianapolis was easy for us because it is the economic and cultural focal point of the nine county region we pride ourselves on being a part of the downtown community and look forward to expanding here
5710327 it is always exciting when a home grown and family operated company like mcgowan insurance decides to stay and continues to grow downtown while looking towards the next generation of corporate leadership the new headquarters facility will make a fantastic addition to downtown and in the indiana avenue cultural district
5710328 did anything i did in life make a difference to someone else
5710329 i hate to go and leave this pretty si ight
5710330 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5710331 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5710332 but one can presume this issue will have to be taken into view
5710333 rear units as well as second and third echelon units are being pulled back first the vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage
5710334 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5710335 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5710336 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5710337 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5710338 mana dia calon angkatan keadilan insan malaysia akim yang kalut masuk bertanding sama kami nak jemput dia bagi ceramah atau penerangan kenapa dia turut bertanding melawan calon pakatan rakyat dato seri anwar ibrahim

5710349 abou slaybi stated that he was by himself during the robbery then stated that he was with his friend
5710350 abou slaybi now stated that he would tell us the truth as long as we promised not to arrest him
5710351 i advised mr abou slaybi that i couldnt promise not to arrest him he now states that he had come here to purchase 350 of marijuana

5710382 this is one of the first columns to leave georgia
5710383 our ammunition medicines have to be correctly loaded with everything checked
5710384 sheep usually just cause delays to a service and some minor repairs when they get to ballarat or melbourne station but its obviously a costly exercise for farmers who have sheep or other animals on the rail reserve
5710385 we are appealing for farmers to tend to their fences because we are seeing a spike particularly on the ballarat line with animals on the tracks
5710386 one of the difficulties is trying to even identify a landowner we cant get access to their details to let them know their fences are in bad shape
5710387 leaving them in a box in a park is completely inappropriate
5710388 any vet and the rscpa are entirely happy to help people with pups
5710389 these puppies may also have been a result of an unplanned mating but there are places where they can go and be looked after
5710390 these pups have loved all the attention theyve received and are very socialised
5710391 the story so far has been not only one sided but extremely unfair to the staff
5710392 nurses spending a lot of time at desks doing paperwork is not adding anything to patient care
5710393 its put enormous pressure on them the staff ive spoken to them and they are as low as can be
5710394 itll just increase the problems in a system in ballarat already under stress
5710395 the accreditation agency should show us the doctors what is wrong to see if its impacted on patient care
5710396 i wouldnt like to think a bureaucrat without a medical background walked in and made such a devastating comment without the entire scenario being included
5710397 i might of even had a peek at magic mushroom
5710398 there is nowhere else for tafe teachers to turn now we have to do this
5710399 this is the start of a very loud industrial campaign weve got a hell of a lot of very angry teachers
5710400 i cant tell you how many teachers will be involved but clearly there will be an impact
5710401 the fact that our tafe teaching staff have not had a salary increase since september 2006 is not a good position for them to be in
5710402 we think now is the time for the state government to respond
5710403 two thirds of the institution has now had a collective agreement which is now going to the vote for approval
5710404 it would be really conducive for us as a managing institution if the settling of the tafe teachers award is done expeditiously
5710405 she wants to say shes sorry for everything but that probably wouldnt work when it comes to the dynamics of the show
5710406 not a chance heidi and audrina are still cool but not for me
5710407 he arrived about five minutes before the show started and stood next to the soundboard he was wearing a yankees baseball hat and trying not to be noticed he was really into the show you could tell he was really focused on her

5710419 we are going to send the message that we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the transatlantic structures like georgia and ukraine
5710420 we are determined to deny them the russians their strategic objective
5710421 the complete withdrawal depends on the policy of saakashvili and the action of his forces
5710422 we are pressing russia to withdraw its troops at least from the heart of georgia to make it possible for talks on a durable ceasefire
5710423 the most important thing at the moment is to consolidate the situation which is still fragile and to bring about a lasting ceasefire
5710424 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5710425 we expect an evaluation of what has happened in georgia and the ways nato can help

5710489 lizette waar ben je je zou thuis moeten zijn we zouden optijd e

5710491 this is product extension at its best where the new products ipod and iphone are helping bring new customers to existing computer products
5710492 the fact that apple is not dependent on the windows vista operating system hasnt hurt either
5710493 the android developer challenge was definitely an important incentive for us
5710494 the project would not have left the ideas stage as quickly as it did if the competition hadnt been there to motivate us

5710498 its much easier for people who have an iphone to buy your application
5710499 i watched it and just had some quick thoughts i thought rick warren did a good job he was trying to create a civil discourse with both candidates and i thought he did that to the best of his ability as to the debate itself i thought both did a good job although as far as getting done politically what needed to get done mccain did better than obama despite the growing consensus in many quarters i dont think obama did that bad although he did make some missteps first off let me say that mccain had some implicit advantages in some of the questions i dont mean that there was cheating or foul play afoot ill deal with that in a moment but i think certain questions intrinsically favored mccain the gut wrenching decision question is an example ive no doubt that obama wrestled with the decision to support the iraq war but that doesnt really compare with the decision to turn down early release from that vietnamese prison camp it just doesnt theres really nothing obama couldve done to counter that although i find myself wishing he had a better answer in fact obama had no real legislative authority to effect the decision to go to war not that settling the moral question in ones heart and mind isnt a serious one so the effect is diminished slightly some may balk at this but i think he shouldve mentioned his decision to break with his former church surely it wouldve opened him up to more scrutiny by his opponents but i take obama at his word on his explanation of why he left trinity the gay marriage answer was pretty good although he did stumble through the last part mccain does get a benefit on the gay marriage abortion and the question of judges because his views on those issues are more in line with those of the audience staying on the abortion question i think obamas biggest gaffe was the obvious one the above my pay grade answer to rick warrens question that was a sloppy mistake i know what he was trying to say its up to god but it came off as evasive cold and stupid
5710500 i do think he had a different attitude about the debate than mccain did that may count as a mistake i do think some of his answers particularly his foreign policy answers were a b i t too abstract and philosophic while mccain went directly to policy and specifics when asked about evil mccain went directly to 9 11 and al q aeda mccain mentioned russia and georgia mccain sounded forceful on those answers obamas answers werent bad its just that mccain seemed to keep the focus on the issues at hand i still hesitate somewhat to call this a mistake on obamas part as both candidates have different approaches and had different tasks during the debate mccain saw this as his opportunity to shore up his evangelical base and the talk from many righties is that they like what they saw obama had to make a good impression with evangelical voters an d he may have hurt himself somewhat with the abortion answer and the dis to clarence thomas not that most conservatives were going to vote for obama anyway

5710510 to infer changes in climate in central china for the last 1270 years in terms of warmer colder wetter and drier conditions
5710511 those corresponding to the medieval warm period little ice age and 20th century warming lending support to the global extent of these events
5710512 corresponds to the age range of the well known maunder minimum 1645 1715
5710513 in agreement with the timing of the little ice age in europe 1560 1850
5710514 show clear evidence of multi year to decadal variations in spring precipitation
5710515 dry periods of 1 2 years were well distributed throughout the record
5710516 all of the wettest 5 year periods occurred prior to 1756
5710517 modern discharge fluctuations do not point to a dominant anthropogenic influence
5710518 point to the domination of the influence of solar activity
5710519 in or near the selenge river basin the largest river in mongolia
5710520 there is much wider variation in the long term tree ring record than in the limited record of measured precipitation
5710521 the short instrumental record of ism underestimates the magnitude of monsoon rainfall variability
5710522 nearly every major famine in india over the period of their study coincided with a period of reduced monsoon rainfall as reflected in the dandak 18 o record
5710523 occurred at the beginning of the little ice age during the longest duration and most severe ism weakening of their reconstruction
5710524 ism reconstructions from arabian sea marine sediments agnihotri et al 2002 gupta et al 2003 von rad et al 1999 stalagmite 18 o records from oman and yemen burns et al 2002 fleitmann et al 2007 and a pollen record from the western himalaya phadtare and pant 2006 also indicate a weaker monsoon during the little ice age and a relatively stronger monsoon during the medieval warm period
5710525 since the end of the little ice age ca 1850 ad the human population in the indian monsoon region has increased from about 200 million to over 1 billion
5710526 a recurrence of weaker intervals of ism comparable to those inferred in our record would have serious implications to human health and economic sustainability in the region

5710530 during ad 1400 1700 the coldest portion of their record corresponding to much of the little ice age the proxy indicators showing the annual temperature experienced larger variability larger standard deviation and this time interval exactly our italics corresponds to the time when the higher and significant wavelet variance occurred
5710531 during ad 1000 1400 the warmest portion of their record corresponding to much of the medieval warm period relatively stable changes of climatic changes reconstructed from proxy indicators in tibet correspond to lower wavelet variance of flood drought series in the yangtze delta region

5710533 laws that forbid the carrying of arms disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man
5710534 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
5710535 despite the macroeconomic conditions we saw improved execution in our merchandising and operations initiatives during the past quarter i am very proud of what our associates have accomplished in a difficult environment
5710536 extends the analyses of the sea ice time series reported by zwally et al 2002 from 20 years 1979 1998 to 28 years 1979 2006
5710537 the total antarctic sea ice extent trend increased slightly from 0 96 0 61 per decade to 1 0 0 4 per decade from the 20 to 28 year period
5710538 reduced convective over turning in the ocean beneath the ice and hence reduced ocean heat flux available to melt ice resulting in an overall increase in ice extent and volume
5710539 what is driving the observed changes remains unanswered and the physical mechanisms explaining these changes remain to be determined
5710540 finding records of past catastrophic storm events is essential to evaluate the long term climatic evolution in a given coastal area
5710541 are under regular management including clear cuts with regeneration by planting and regular thinnings
5710542 to produce such ecosystem structures that facilitate the production of the targeted services e g timber production
5710543 temperature may increase by 1 2 c in summer and by 2 3 c in winter over the next 50 years carter et al 2005
5710544 the total amount of carbon in upland sites may be close to 30 greater than at present
5710545 the resultant assessment of southern ocean productivity is the most exhaustive ever compiled and provides an improvement in the quantitative role of carbon fixation in antarctic waters
5710546 during the nine years 1997 2006 analyzed in this study
5710547 productivity in the entire southern ocean showed a substantial and significant increase during the nine year observation period
5710548 the highly significant increase in the productivity of the entire southern ocean over the past decade implies that long term changes in antarctic food webs and biogeochemical cycles are presently occurring
5710549 the dramatic fungal pathogen linked extinctions of numerous harlequin frogs atelopus spp in upland rainforests of south america mostly occurred immediately following exceptionally warm years implicating global warming as a likely trigger for these extinctions
5710550 using temperature data for eastern australia where at least 14 upland rainforest frog species have also experienced extinctions or striking population declines attributed to the same fungal pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidus a waterborne chytrid fungus and where temperatures have also risen significantly in recent decades
5710551 provide little direct support for the warm year hypothesis of pounds et al
5710552 found stronger support for a modified version of the warm year hypothesis
5710553 only at tropical latitudes where rising minimum temperatures were greatest
5710554 remain unconvinced that ongoing disease linked amphibian declines are being widely instigated by rising global temperatures or associated climatic variables as proposed by pounds et al
5710555 chytrid linked amphibian declines have been documented on several continents and at varying times
5710556 no single environmental stressor has been identified that can easily account for these numerous population crashes
5710557 it stretches plausibility to argue that the chytrid pathogen is simply an opportunistic endemic microparasite that has suddenly begun causing catastrophic species declines as a consequence of contemporary global warming
5710558 both field studies on amphibians and on fungal population genetics strongly suggest that batrachochytrium dendrobatidus is a newly introduced invasive pathogen
5710559 spreads from its point of origin in a pattern typical of many emerging infectious diseases
5710560 i dont know if its because im a girl or because they dont think of rifle and shooting as a sport i tell them we shoot competitively and it takes people some time to get used to the idea
5710561 one day my mom came to pick us up from my dads and i told her to watch what i was going to do
5710562 i put some cans in a pyramid started from the top and picked each one of them off
5710563 we had to room together every night we were on the road so we became real close real fast
5710564 were like charlies angels all three of us are different but we just work well together all you have to do is ask for help and everyone is more than willing
5710565 shooting is very competitive but everyone is so willing to help
5710566 if theres a problem if youre trying to get over a hump and you cant figure out why something isnt working anybody from your competitor to the person beside you could say something like why dont you try clicking up or move your arm forward no one seems to feel like its a competition
5710567 for a team like us that scrapes by we do really well in the searc because its all about doing the best that you can
5710568 i enjoy rifle and i love the people involved in it
5710569 not just within our conferences but in the sir walter gun club and at the holly springs range after im done with college whether i continue or not depends on where ill be and what ill be doing
5710570 id like to bring in a big man who can play with his back to the basket
5710571 we are looking to bring in another big man with some experience to round out their roster

5710573 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5710574 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5710575 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5710576 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5710577 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5710578 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5710579 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5710580 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5710581 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5710582 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives
5710583 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5710584 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5710585 there were certain elements who were politicking with the economy and terrorism
5710586 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days

5710590 hmm but its a very complicated mechanism and your big claws will only destroy it even more
5710591 oh no give it to me and it will be fixed
5710592 thats ridiculous any fool knows that lazy lions with great claws cannot fix complicated watches
5710593 sure they do give it to me and it will be fixed
5710594 can i come and watch tv tonight with you because mine is broken
5710595 you dont expect me to believe such rubbish do you
5710596 thats ridiculous any fool knows that rabbits dont eat foxes
5710597 you dont expect to get such rubbish published do you

5710599 im just back from a wonderful weekend steeped in ars magica
5710600 it was a great success thanks to cjs excessively hard work to his helpers lorna and kevin to david for making it happen in the first place and leading discussions during the weekend to you both for providing goodies for the very profitable raffle and allowing us to have the magnificent con t shirt to all those who ran games and to everyone who attended and made it all so enjoyable
5710601 varies by topic if you were to compare us to someone like digg a story about apple is ranked the same way as a story about everything else we rank according to these topics
5710602 thats a good question thats come up a few times
5710603 weve been categorized as both a search engine and a publisher but we havent constructed a search engine that crawls the web but this is something thats interesting to us we want to make a place where users can show up and find great stuff this is opposed to users going to a new site and starting from scratch when it comes to finding something interesting
5710604 were not sure yet captain but i believe we are moving
5710605 captain sensors on the probe just picked up a phase hiccup
5710606 locke the anomaly is closing in on itself call it natures ability to making things right if we dont close this thing it could cause a black hole that will swallow the neighboring systems
5710607 i wish president musharraf all the best we have had difficult days together but also we had good days together all in all we had a good relationship
5710608 the most important thing is not personalities what is important is that we change our expectations and the way we formulate policies to meet those expectations
5710609 if they are doing that in order to get strategic depth it will not happen it has been tried before it failed if they are doing that in order to have a puppet government it will not happen it will not work
5710610 if they are doing that to gain an upper hand against another of their neighbors
5710611 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
5710612 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
5710613 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
5710614 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5710615 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
5710616 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
5710617 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
5710618 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
5710619 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
5710620 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
5710621 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
5710622 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
5710623 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
5710624 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
5710625 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
5710626 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
5710627 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
5710628 you cant live in the bubble of sub space forever
5710629 and we had not anticipated the alliance sending a ship after us and we certainly did not expect such a drastic time dialaton
5710630 we just happened upon you by chance if we stay any longer who knows how much time will pass help us let us help you
5710631 its the end of the line if we do not get our hands on another batch of oxy we will run out within the month
5710632 when i first ordered research on the refining of oxy only a select few of my crew were using it once trapped we started regular injections for the whole crew to help work around the clock they almost killed each other to get to it
5710633 i have an incomplete album that i want to finish i have been thinking about the plan during my days in jail i have sung rock n roll for 40 years after jail i will rock n roll
5710634 im rooting for michael phelps along with the rest of the world
5710635 im friendly with him we met four years ago when he was just trying out for his first olympics and to see how far hes come he was a kid and now hes just so much more poised and handling the pressure so well
5710636 im a motorcycle enthusiast and found myself unable to keep track of all the news that was out there on a daily basis thats what prompted me to build loud3r
5710637 i tried using rss readers and other services but only found an overwhelming amount of spam and fake web sites i created loud3r as an intelligent publishing platform that will help millions of people find the content theyre really looking for online
5710638 microsoft game studios and silicon knights are committed to finishing the first instalment but too human is an overarching epic with a rich and vast game universe that cannot be told in one instalment

5710690 congress approved hundreds of millions of dollars of military assistance to georgia a small country of less than five million people in addition the united states successfully encouraged israel to send advisors and trainers to support the rapidly expanding georgian armed forces
5710691 the georgians may only be interested in regaining control over an area they consider part of their national territory
5710692 but the russians are sending a message to the rest of the world that they intend to keep their hands on the caspian sea energy spigot come what may this doesnt necessarily mean occupying georgia outright but they will certainly retain their strategic positions in abkhazia and south ossetia for all practical purposes daggers aimed at the btc jugular so even if a cease fire is put into effect the struggle over energy resources sometimes hidden and stealthy sometimes open and violent will continue long into the future
5710693 in the short memory of current events what has been overlooked is just how pro western russias government has been all along instead of backtracking on yeltsins democracy medvedev and his continuation of the putin plan was at least until this month as committed to western economic integration as russias first post soviet leader boris yeltsin ever was and perhaps more so

5710749 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5710750 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over this is not working
5710751 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple

5710756 nearly always insist that his election as a mixed race mixed heritage president would transform americas image abroad
5710757 on the other hand mccain originally pledged to run an honorable campaign and so far there is nothing honorable about the lies he puts out daily and hiring the same swif boat crew operatives from 4 and 8 years ago
5710758 can we go back to the supreme court justices question again
5710759 imagine what would happen to the country if old man mccain would steal the presidency
5710760 barack obama favors a huge increase in government spending on programs that either 1 are overfunded or 2 are unnecessary

5710773 for the past century pastoralists in kenya have suffered the consequences of poor decisions taken by those charged with planning and decision making
5710774 many people say pastoralism is a livelihood which time has passed im happy that is changing
5710775 it is time we came together to address this issue of climate change now time is not on our side
5710776 there is a humanitarian crisis looming in northern kenya as pastoralists have resorted to eating wild fruits and gum arabica to contain hunger this is a community which has been self reliant on food as the majority of them were farmers
5710777 it is about time donors and government reconsider their strategies and empower pastoralist communities by directing funding support to pastoralists institutions

5710792 an international crisis is usually good for prime ministers as they uphold the national interest in weighty discussions with foreign leaders they can put a distance between themselves and the opposition leaders they can speak and act for the whole country not mr brown he has been far less interested in georgia than in milibadevs attacks on gordia there is only one conclusion to be drawn from his unwillingness to involve himself in great events and it is not a new one this man is not fit to be prime minister

5710800 being told just spend three months coming up with ideas then saying take six months to get a playable up gives them time to get it right and theyre loving it
5710801 players expect more than before the game is already half done right but most sequels have less development time and indeed we didnt get much pre production time its really hard to eke out pre production time for a sequel the lesson is to compete in novelty not size

5710803 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations

5710826 a signal integrity engineers companion real time test and measurement and design simulation
5710827 signal integrity engineering is a relatively new branch of electronic engineering and for the most part relates to the analog factors that affect both the performance and the reliability of modern high speed digital systems
5710828 in particular when applied to the high speed serial buses encountered in modern communication and computer systems issues of signal accuracy can play a key part in the overall reliability of designs and their compliance with evolving bus standards
5710829 this new book provides engineers a comprehensive authoritative and practical guide to modern signal integrity test and measurement for high speed digital designs it is destined to become a standard reference for students and engineers worldwide

5710840 we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5710841 i feel greatly sorry there are so many people who worry about me take care of me care about me and support me honestly i could do nothing
5710842 i dont know why this happened and this is not what i wanted to see really it the pain was intolerable if i withstood it the pain my hamstring really would not have been able to cope no matter how much i wanted it to
5710843 i have to be optimistic not blaming anyone keeping up my spirit i will never easily give up this is my character i will make them see
5710844 if i was in a position to retire i would be doing it right now i would be doing a press conference and getting everyone along for my last melbourne game but i am long from retired i reckon i have got another two years left in me the body is still good the mind is still good i am still motivated to play and i want to give myself every opportunity to play next year
5710845 since missing a game in 2003 with my shin i played 100 games straight before i got dropped
5710846 it was a bit out of the blue to be dropped because at that stage i was averaging 20 possessions a match which is my career high but i know i was not dropped on form i was dropped because they wanted to play youth and that is fine i understand that
5710847 the youth policy probably also means that for me to play on next year it will probably have to be somewhere else
5710848 but from a personal point of view i want to play and if it is with another club next year then that is what i want to do
5710849 i think the game is actually trending towards my style of game as a mobile ruckman look at dean cox he is averaging 22 possessions a game for west coast and that is something that at the start of the year the coaching staff said to me over the last few years you have averaged 16 17 possessions a game we want to get you to 20 possessions a game which i did but then i got dropped for the youth policy
5710850 i just dont want to shut the door on my career i dont believe i am ready for that and look they re signed james mcdonald last week so you never know
5710851 we were to have a meeting this week after they have a list management meeting because i said if next week is going to be my last game for melbourne i want to know so i can let people know and get them along
5710852 i love the club and would love to play on so it is not a decision i take lightly but i just feel i have more in me
5710853 if melbourne was in the top eight there would be no question of where jeff white would be playing football next year but melbourne is on the bottom and the situation changes
5710854 we know the bigger players mature later and jeff is 31 and still in great physical shape
5710855 it will not be moved from pakistan i am not even willing to answer any questions to that effect
5710856 i am more than disappointed this has gone beyond logic their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5710857 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5710858 our information is specific to being in an australian team in pakistan at this particular time so it is distinctively unique and there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5710859 we advise you to reconsider your need to travel to sri lanka at this time because of the very high risk of politically motivated violence
5710860 the ideal situation would be for the icc to move the event because from an aca perspective our players wont be going to pakistan and they want to play in the champions trophy
5710861 sri lanka has its own set of concerns for us
5710862 the primary concern is that we have a well established process for assessing the security situation wherever we go theres 20 days between now and the start of the event
5710863 does that give us enough time to assess the situation in sri lanka
5710864 i dont know a lot about the cars but i have heard it is very exciting and fast racing and that the tracks are also exciting it should be a lot of fun

5710941 there have been low key warnings in the past few months of an internet based scam directed at landlords of student housing the scam is very much alive this third week in august
5710942 the landlord advertises availability of student housing over the internet it is not just students who look at your ad scammers monitor these ads as well
5710943 but this is the first time i have encountered this scam i used to teach an internet security course at the university and that helped prepare me for something like this
5710944 a landlord may get an e mail asking for more information maybe pictures and always how much deposit is needed to hold the apartment or room if the landlord responds the student will ask to reserve the apartment and promises to send a deposit payment right away and the landlord is asked to let the student know when the deposit check arrives
5710945 you are going to be asked to cash the check and then send the deposit money back to the student the scammers check is bad and if you cash it you will probably receive a non sufficient fund charge from your bank and if you send the money to the student you will be out of the money
5710946 to be cautious and use the normal verification procedures before agreeing to rent to a prospective college student
5710947 i have seen similar scams in different venues and we all need to use common sense and properly check out new tenants
5710948 approximately 1 000 scam tenant e mails during the past year
5710949 usually they are from an e mail account in england a few from canada and occasionally from the united states i only rent to someone in person and dont accept personal checks and i will tell these scam artists that i know what they are up to but if they want to come here and discuss the rental in person i will be glad to talk to them
5710950 this scam has been out there for the past year so i have been very careful about these e mail rental requests
5710951 with an alleged scammer and has been approached by one other who is probably working the same fraud
5710952 if i receive a deposit check in the mail i intend to turn it over to the federal bureau of investigation and ask them to pursue the case
5710953 ask for names phone numbers and addresses of references including former landlords and employers ask for contact names at the school or university where the student is supposed to be enrolled what program is the student pursuing what year is he or she is there anyone in admissions or any teacher that you could talk to about the student and take the time to follow up these references with phone calls
5710954 insist that the student have a conversation with you on the phone when you receive a deposit do not cash it simply hold onto it until you meet the student face to face

5710959 we are back to the days when profit and power were valued at all costs over people
5710960 a no holds barred arena with such dominating and perverse power
5710961 our ruthless big business government will not rest until it finishes wrecking our country
5710962 big business and state socialism are very much alike especially big business
5710963 business especially big business is now organized like an army it is as some would say a sort of mild militarism without bloodshed as i say a militarism without the military virtues
5710964 the husbandman that laboreth must be the first partaker of the fruits
5710965 a system in which government whether federal or local picks the winners in the economy is not capitalism its not competition its not free market it is corporate socialism it is statism its the state making these choices
5710966 the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself that in its essence is fascism ownership of government by an individual by a group or any controlling private power
5710967 to ensure that live animals are treated in a manner conducive to the tenets of established humane handling practices
5710968 what i saw when i was there they had a right to be
5710969 some plants are very clever to make sure they dont do bad things when the auditors are around
5710970 nobody wants to be the next westland hallmark and get caught by surprise like that
5710971 isnt the best way to ensure that the public is well protected
5710972 the audits can definitely be a problem because the company for the most part knows exactly when the auditors are coming and can adjust their procedures accordingly
5710973 youve got to have the federal and state governments involved as well
5710974 we have companies that have taken food and turned it into something unhealthy
5710975 were treating our children and old people in ways that are unacceptable did your mom and dad simply feed you with the cheapest thing they could find
5710976 we are instructed to treat people the way we want to be treated
5710977 of the 143 million pounds involved with this recall we have about 50 3 million pounds that went to federal nutrition programs
5710978 of that 50 3 million pounds we have 19 6 million pounds that were consumed
5710979 w e call it a very very remote probability of any adverse illness
5710980 coming from the government you would think they were sending us good things
5710981 i was very concerned because weve been getting this meat for a long time
5710982 the ladies that work here they dont eat anything but ranch foods direct
5710983 parents have to stand up and say i want my child to have better food at school
5710984 the bottom line is this industrialized model of agriculture has managed to externalize a lot of the costs costs of a living wage environmental costs losing our domestic food system parents have to be willing to stand up and say that they will not pay for fake industrialized food
5710985 when we send our kids off to school with a mountain dew and snickers bar its not cutting it weve got to get them back to whole foods
5710986 i love these kids and i dont want any of them getting sick now i dont have to worry about that
5710987 i didnt know the english were good at swimming i have been in this country for 12 years and havent seen a swimming pool
5710988 my lifestyle has changed a lot because on a saturday night when some of the guys go night clubbing and stuff i choose not to
5710989 during the season i look at my alcohol intake and i try not to drink any at all occasionally if theres a players do or something i might but its all controlled i dont overdo it
5710990 i think it will galvanise not only the players but also the city
5710991 this is a regular hurling board meeting and there are eight minutes on the agenda
5710992 these include local championship matters and our minor hurlers who qualified for the all ireland final on sunday setanta readers comment of the day
5710993 it makes sense to have the first night of the film here with the general public in sligo tonight we have lived and worked here and struggled to get the film financed so we are delighted to be here and to see everyone here tonight
5710994 it can be very hard to get backing for filming in ireland thats anywhere outside either dublin or wicklow
5710995 i had to make a few stops in the middle but i made it
5710996 if anybody had told me last november when she was diagnosed with cancer that id be up here today i wouldnt have believed them
5710997 we have been in contact with sligo airport about this and wish to compliment them on the increase in numbers between 2007 and 2008 but there are many other factors at play in our decision
5710998 naturally we are disappointed about the development but it is a suspension rather than a complete halt aer arann have told us about this decision which is made against a background which many airlines are facing
5710999 we have worked hard to develop this route not just here in sligo but also in manchester we managed to increase the number of passengers travelling to manchester by 20 per cent in the period from june august
5711000 aer arann has been operating this service for the past 15 months but we will continue to work hard to help those passengers who have been affected to make sure that sligo airport continues to grow business in 2009
5711001 it is particularly disappointing given the amount of effort and hard work invested in this route by sligo airport and the marketing sligo forum
5711002 we are aware of the demand for parking in sligo and the aim would be to have this car park in place prior to christmas
5711003 cause stress and anxiety to the residents together with imposing dereliction on the area
5711004 elderly residents who are not in a position at this stage of their lives to protect and defend themselves
5711005 i believe that a temporary car park of this nature would very clearly cause the crime and public order situation in the city to deteriorate
5711006 already suffered enough with the building of the mid block route
5711007 but i consider that there has been significant change to the streets character since construction of the inner relief road and consider it likely that any residential uses may be replaced by office or commercial uses in the future
5711008 i was so surprised and so delighted i thought that i had done quite well and was hoping that i had enough for my course but this is beyond my wildest dreams
5711009 i like rock music and i went out all the time during the year as well as working hard it is important to have a balance between the academic life and the social life you need to have a social life also
5711010 the history of loud music and noise pollution from gatherings of large numbers of people coming and going in the early hours of the morning and hanging around the apartments door plus bottles and lighted cigarettes being thrown from the roof
5711011 the lovely and peaceful environment which we have grown to love and appreciate
5711012 overlooking our peaceful courtyard where our main doors and bedrooms windows of our apartments are situated would become very noisy and we would not feel secure at present we live in a retail and residential area which is trouble free and peaceful

5711020 we may need to look at seeing if we do need some other kind of leadership because there is only so much embattlement that any one person can take i just dont know whether or not he is going to be able to do this for an extremely long time and be able to give it his best

5711041 i take comfort in my belief that productions happen when they are supposed to the cast and creative team was poised to create a terrific production and i have no doubt it will be just that when its time comes

5711045 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5711046 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5711047 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5711048 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5711049 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5711050 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5711051 i think kp needs to concentrate on beating south africa first rather than worrying about the ashes
5711052 if anybody is thinking about the ashes in my opinion they are thinking way too far ahead its going to be an interesting time in pietersens career to see how he goes as captain
5711053 i think the one thing i want to make clear at the camp is we have some really tough cricket coming up before england next year
5711054 we have three massive test series in the next year
5711055 i think all three india in india south africa home and away and england in england are going to be as hard as each other its about adapting because all three are completely different conditions
5711056 all our planning for the next 12 months will come from the camp
5711057 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5711058 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour
5711059 unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5711060 the icc has got the unambiguous understanding from a collective view on pakistan
5711061 hopefully the icc having now heard the concerns of the players will make a common sense decision and move the event
5711062 if the tournament is moved to sri lanka we will have to go through the same security process with cricket australia that we did for pakistan
5711063 our major concern is time with only 20 days to the start of the event
5711064 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan where as the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5711065 certainly we will need a detailed security assessment of sri lanka should the tournament be moved there before making any decisions
5711066 i will continue to work until a new chairman is appointed and i dont see my leaving affecting the champions trophy because pcb is an institution and institutions are not run by individuals
5711067 we have just completed the test on asifs b sample and it has come back positive
5711068 but i can tell you that the quantity of nandrolone has varied which we can contest
5711069 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5711070 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5711071 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5711072 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5711073 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5711074 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5711075 signing this initiative does serious harm to the education and enforcement efforts on our campuses and ultimately endangers young lives even more
5711076 i ask every higher education leader who has signed to reconsider i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
5711077 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5711078 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5711079 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5711080 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5711081 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue

5711094 i think theres a real feeling in the nato meeting today that russia has failed to live up to its commitments and that that has serious consequences for the trust thats placed in russia as an international partner
5711095 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5711096 its one of those situations where he assumed weve talked about assumptions thats an assumption on his part thats part of his game weve got to get rid of

5711098 many believe iso 27001 2005 to be largely about the physical aspects of security
5711099 the reality is iso 27001 2005 certification touches on nearly every management process in running information security including it and areas such as disaster recovery its not just about locking things down iso 27001 2005 certification establishes a holistic mindset that permeates every aspect of information security management at its most basic level going through the certification process helps create a culture that respects the intellectual property of others and will not tolerate breaches this is a major point of assurance for anyone contemplating sending all or part of their it process offshore

5711104 looking for an easy way out of an inconvenient problem
5711105 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
5711106 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
5711107 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
5711108 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5711109 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
5711110 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
5711111 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
5711112 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
5711113 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
5711114 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
5711115 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
5711116 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
5711117 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
5711118 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
5711119 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
5711120 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
5711121 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

5711143 what drove us to netsuite was both its lower cost and greater feature set
5711144 we needed our crm data integrated with our accounting and erp data providing a complete solution to provide better all around support to our customers netsuite provided more out of the box functionality at a much lower investment on the order of thousands of dollars compared to the great plains microsoft crm combination netsuite gives us everything in one system and its web based saving our residential program even more money because we dont need to invest in and maintain a client server architecture like our parent company needed for great plains
5711145 after a little more than two years of using great plains and salesforce com we decided we really needed a completely integrated system to gain better visibility so we switched to netsuite
5711146 the problem with great plains was that it didnt allow the operations group to view vendor and customer related information with netsuites integrated platform both our operations group and accounting group are much more effective and efficient without added costs of great plains licenses on top of salesforce com licenses additionally the ability to access our accounting information along with crm data from anywhere in the country is a huge benefit for our company we fully utilize the netsuite accounting functionality as well as sales force automation and email marketing campaigns on a daily basis
5711147 weve been using it for about six months now and its drastically better than microsoft great plains which was too complex with netsuite we can purchase product create orders for customers and then ship collect money and support those customers and pay our bills we can see more metrics across the business because we dont require integration with other systems
5711148 the best thing about netsuite is its ease of use
5711149 great plains required a lot of time effort and help from external developer and consulting resources that added to the on going cost of maintenance we had to use separate applications with it and it wasnt smooth to pass from one application to another with netsuite everything is integrated and we have real time access across all our core business operations

5711170 we are proudly to have paypal china to sponsor 2008 china travel distribution amp technology summit
5711171 we are pleased to sponsor one of the most high profile events of travel industry in china this will increase paypal visibility in china china will become the no 1 tourist destination in the world by 2015 paypal is helping chinese travel service providers leverage paypals huge user base worldwide to tackle the booming inbound travel opportunities brought up by beijing olympics and shanghai expo
5711172 roy this is an interview by eye for travel which i gave last week
5711173 this then has a negative effect on new investment so i do not see these events contributing to a growth in online distribution
5711174 consumers are much more reluctant to pay directly online it is also a restricted market protecting local companies and this restricts the introduction of foreign advanced technologies or innovative foreign disruptive technology in the next few years the business2business environment will be firmly engaged in online distribution and procurement of product the most significant change will be in the way hotel product in china is distributed
5711175 the trouble that some travel companies and hotels find themselves in due to the slowdown will drive consolidation and alliances in the months to come which will have an impact on the sector
5711176 hopefully hotels will learn from the experience of the olympics not to rely on large scale events and inflated rates but to follow a path of smart distribution strategy through multiple channels and multiple markets more otas and online consolidators are entering as enabling technology becomes more accessible and cheaper for chinese hotels
5711177 the gds market will have to be regulated although i do not believe the government will relinquish complete control more likely they will announce further alliances with major international gds to provide new technology and further inventory for travelsky the chinese monopoly gds more airline consolidation is also expected in china as airlines lose money on rising fuel costs
5711178 i think we will see mergers and acquisitions happening early in 2009 i also believe that the chinese government will announce further relaxation of protective regulation in the sector to boost the industry post olympics

5711194 then zecheriah prayed to his lord o lord grant me from yourself out of your grace the gift of a goodly offspring for indeed you alone heed all prayers as he stood praying in the sanctuary the angels called out to him allah gives you good tidings of john who shall confirm a command of allah shall be outstanding among men utterly chaste and a prophet from among the righteous

5711206 do you really believe that present inflation is demand driven
5711207 that monetary policy is the root cause of the recent increase in the relative prices of energy and food
5711208 dismisses the critical non monetary factors including increasing commodity demand from strong capacity growth of the global economy coupled with short run supply constraints and various government distortions
5711209 then ask them hey how would you like a new car
5711210 and so you can also forget about capacity growth too because without the money to fuel the demand growth there aint no stinking capacity growth and thus there wont be any short run supply constraints although there will always be various government distortions

5711219 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5711220 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5711221 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5711222 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5711223 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5711224 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5711225 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5711226 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5711227 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5711228 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5711229 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5711230 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5711231 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5711300 our entire campus works very hard on our environmental efforts and this achievement truly reflects our commitment to sustainability these efforts have been a priority for me and we have put into place a number of initiatives to engage all of our campus constituents from the student in the dorm room to our maintenance crews higher education has a unique role to play in addressing sustainability issues and we take this responsibility very seriously being named to this prestigious honor roll indicates our firm commitment
5711301 the green movement on college campuses is far more than an earth day recycling project or a dining hall menu of organic food the commitment that many colleges and their student bodies have made to environmental issues indeed to the environment in their practices use of resources and academic and research programs is truly compelling we are pleased to play a role in helping students identify get into and study at these schools it is the students of today who will face and hopefully find solutions for the enormous environmental challenges confronting our planets future

5711365 coming out in recruiting i was leaning a little more towards the university of oklahoma and that was simply because back in those days they had the wishbone
5711366 at lampasas high we ran the wishbone and they also ran the wishbone at texas but oklahoma had some wishbone halfbacks that were just a little more flashier than the texas running backs texas had roosevelt leaks and earl campbell thats two of the best right there if you were a wishbone halfback youd lean a little more towards the joe washington and greg pruitt type of running back thats the type of back i was i was considered more of the fast quick and shifty type of back those were the type of backs that had been going to the university of oklahoma so i was leaning heavily towards oklahoma

5711381 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5711382 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5711383 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5711384 relative to the 13 features examined in the study interest in alternative powertrain technologies particularly clean diesel is much higher among consumers in germany and the united kingdom compared with consumers in the united states
5711385 the gap in interest may be attributed to the tendency of consumers in european markets to purchase smaller vehicles that are more conducive to hybrid electric technology diesel technology also has a much stronger presence in these regions compared with the united states
5711386 low interest levels for satellite radio may be attributed to low market penetration for this feature in both germany and the united kingdom
5711387 however as new satellite radio providers enter the market it is likely that an increase in familiarity will also lead to a general increase in consumer interest for this feature

5711395 we found that if a teacher has a high achieving group of students pushing them harder by giving them more homework could be beneficial
5711396 similarly if a teacher has a low ability class assigning more homework may help since they may not have been pushed hard enough but for the average achieving classes who may have been given too much homework in an attempt to equate them with the high achieving classes educators could be better served by using other methods to improve student achievement given these students abilities and time constraints learning by doing may be a more effective tool for improvement
5711397 there has been an extensive amount of research examining the influences of students achievement but it has been primarily focused on financial inputs such as class size or teachers credentials
5711398 our study examined the affect that additional homework has on test scores
5711399 this does not mean that homework is unimportant for average achievers
5711400 but it does mean that this population may also benefit from other activities such as sports art or music rather than additional hours of math homework
5711401 in my own personal experience i see that each semester requires a different approach
5711402 this is even true when i teach the same course twice in a semester different times of the day or lengths of classes require different methods just as different quality students require different approaches
5711403 teachers should consider quality over quantity when it comes to homework assignments
5711404 in the end it should be up to the individual teacher to decide how to motivate and educate their students
5711405 with this new process we are reducing the travel distance of a space vehicle from 12 000 feet to 10 000 feet
5711406 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
5711407 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
5711408 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings
5711409 i am not surprised that our graduates are highly ranked in respect to their earnings

5711413 nasa engineers and designers were coached by celerant to think outside the box when approaching design during a three day training course
5711414 celerant is fully committed to supporting nasa as they apply innovative thinking and design to 21st century space programs
5711415 meeting these challenging design requirements calls for a novel training approach that enables engineers to go from the fuzzy front divergent end of innovation to the application of tools and methods for converging on final design solutions
5711416 celerant is thrilled to have been selected for this essential program and looks forward to a collaborative future with nasa

5711425 im just gonna say a lot of big records i was on a good portion of those records or asked to be on a good portion of those records that lil wayne was on along with him not like they asked me before they asked him or vice versa i know i was on a good portion of those records cause the i cant feel my face thing we were pushing that hard people wanted to get both of us i couldnt go as far as the clearances i could do my verse then it got to the point where i couldnt go there with people because i didnt want them to think that it was me being the bad guy not clearing stuff i didnt want that on my name so i would let people know i cant really if you wanna just put it out on the mixtapes we could do that all day the fans definitely missed out on a lot of juelz due to my contract

5711434 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5711435 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5711436 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5711437 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5711438 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5711439 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5711440 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5711441 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5711442 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5711443 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5711444 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5711445 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock

5711539 when i turned 30 last year i knew from experience that most entrepreneurs struggle and began having a vision about creating a movement that could empower young men and women to take ownership of their gifts and talents to design the lifestyle of their dreams
5711540 this realization inspired me to embark on a cross country cinematic journey to capture the success stories of more than 30 of americas youngest innovators and demonstrate how theyre reshaping the world we live in the yes movie and the young entrepreneurs society are both the type of resources i wished id had during high school or college

5711564 you can see the spin coming off the oppositions racquet on clay so if its sliced its going to stay low if its top spin its going to kick up spin is exaggerated
5711565 but clay can change a great deal if youve just had a bit or rain and the surface is a bit moist the balls will pick up water and theyll be come heavy
5711566 that slows the ball down even more making it very hard to hit winners
5711567 on the other hand if its hot and sunny and youve got a nice dusty court then the ball will zip through like a harder surface
5711568 so you need to be flexible and patient on clay sometimes you need to grind it out you arent going to hit any winners unless youre a brutal hitter of the ball
5711569 the movement is different because you must time your slide which can be anything up to two metres
5711570 of course if you dont slide at all you cant get back to cover the court and youll be out of position it can be the difference between winning and losing a point
5711571 many players use an open stance and often your foot is planted on the floor because of the loose nature of the surface you really need to be flexible in your movement and quick adjustment
5711572 you need to dictate otherwise youre doing all the running all the moving and the slipping and sliding

5711581 we think the judge did a fine job of listening to all the testimony and agreeing with us as to what the best route would be to protect homeowners and the environment
5711582 in its order the court recommended the exact route proposed by the hunsaders which borrows the best segments from both the fpl original corridor and the so called consensus corridor
5711583 smr is pleased that the judge recognized the benefits of the unique compromise
5711584 while smr will bear the burden of having over 10 miles of this line on its property the new location will not impact existing residential areas and we will be able to design future neighborhoods to minimize exposure to the line
5711585 is the best of the three proposals because it presents an opportunity for a net environmental benefit with smrs offer to protect 600 more acres of sensitive lands

5711688 the deceleration in economic activity in the first half of the year meant a loss of momentum for job creation in the overall economy but especially in the formal sector
5711689 indeed if financial firms are not going to be allowed to go out of business how exactly do central banks and regulators intend to effect the shrinkage of the financial industry commensurate with the sharp fall in key lines of business related to mortgage securitization and derivatives perhaps regulators hope firms will shrink 10 15 per cent across the board but this is seldom how consolidation works in any industry rather the weakest firms go out of business with their healthy parts being taken over or pushed aside by better run institutions is every failure evidence of a crisis for a myriad reasons both technical and political financial market regulation is never going to be stringent enough in booms that is why it is important to be tougher in busts so that investors and company executives have cause to pay serious attention to risks if poorly run financial institutions are not allowed to close their doors during recessions when exactly are they going to be allowed to fail
5711690 u s gasoline demand appeared to be quite unresponsive to price during 2001 2006 my interpretation is that the primary reason we ignored 3 00 gasoline is because we could afford to but as gas prices rose and the number of gallons purchased held steady the budget share for energy has gone up pretty dramatically over the last year fewer people seem to be ignoring 4 00
5711691 the presence of these facilities does not absolutely prevent the fed from tightening because the fed has made some separation between its monetary policy tools and its liquidity tools
5711692 however in our view it leans the fed in that direction
5711693 these lending facilities would be withdrawn should the board determine that conditions in financial markets are no longer unusual and exigent
5711694 theres some intellectual case to be made that they cant be tightening when theyre declaring that financial conditions are bad
5711695 it wouldnt make sense for the fed to raise rates if theyre trying to expand liquidity
5711696 that would basically push up all the rates people would pay on these facilities it would be an exercise in futility
5711697 the fomc might want to see how the markets function without the liquidity facilities before deciding whether it is time to raise rates

5711752 time and again shes recognized the advertising potential of alternative media and delivered brilliantly on the opportunity with the ooh entertainment market experiencing explosive growth i am tvs sales force could not be in better hands janice joined i am tv with a level of excitement for our network that ive never seen before and im sure she will spark that same enthusiasm in every member of her sales team
5711753 with them putting the spores out in the field a storm could come up the florida panhandle and bring it right on up into georgia and alabama to me it was playing with fire
5711754 you can do that but there is still some chance that the rust could get out of the greenhouses and start an infestation
5711755 has not presented sufficient evidence for comparing the potential reward from the research with the potential risk of infecting commercial soybean production areas of the united states
5711756 but our first line of defense in protecting our producers from this potentially catastrophic disease is to limit the overwintering potential of this pathogen in the mid south and all soybean producing regions of the united states
5711757 rust essentially has to move in each summer from southern florida coastal regions of louisiana texas and mexico it concerns me that we are compromising all that good hard work to do research that we know nothing about
5711758 its far enough away from here but that doesnt mean its a healthy situation we dont know exactly what is going on or what type of research they do
5711759 our concern is that it gets into the environment and spreads spores all over the south it could also eventually cause problems for the midwest its not just mississippi its a national issue we really need to get to the bottom of it
5711760 if you find one pustule on kudzu in a county you have the authority to carry on soybean rust and produce literally millions of spores
5711761 is making a decision on its own that it is worth the risk of potentially costing farmers who have nothing to say about whats happening
5711762 where the rust pathogen overwinters annually and is along way from our production but in quincy youre 20 miles from production fields
5711763 has never had an outbreak that was identified as a product of our research prior to this year we had a grower about three miles from the station who was growing about 300 acres of soybeans and we never saw any impact on those beans at all
5711764 can you say the risk is absolutely zero of course not but is the risk significant enough for there to be concern by our florida growers i dont think so
5711765 north florida ended up being a hot spot for rust
5711766 thats why a lot of the research that was going on in other parts of the world were transferred to this center as well as a lot of new research that has started up in the last few years
5711767 the disease in south america is completely different from what we have seen in this country
5711768 this is not a break in the levee its just another management practice that we do to keep rust from being a major problem here in florida and other parts of the country
5711769 all of our florida growers have been pleased with the research and want to see it continue
5711770 some of them have had soybean rust but in general weve had very few production fields with any amount of soybean rust that would make an impact on yield
5711771 i have no complaints about quincy once we pointed out our concerns they got busy and made some changes thats what we were asking for were going to keep working together and if we have any problems down the road well work them out theyre still doing their greenhouse testing but they are willing to look at that each year and readjust if need be
5711772 we will have a class aug 11 13 where we train scientists farmers and others around the country on how to scout for rust we show them everything that we do here and how we do it so that they are trained not only in scouting but also in the biology and activities here
5711773 we also have a lot of visitors who stop by during the soybean growing season thats fine we go out of our way to try and accommodate them
5711774 in the long run the research coming out of here will not only help florida growers but should help growers from mississippi and on up the country
5711775 thats been our intent to start with to be a resource and to gain information to help our growers and we can manage it
5711776 if there is no danger of what is going on down there in quincy why do we have all these sentinel plots which are planted early to capture a low level of inoculum
5711777 the nectariless trait is a non transgenic piece of quote unquote technology that was really discovered back in the 1940s
5711778 were going back and repeating this study across a broader set of environments
5711779 the end result is we believe this particular trait can interact positively with some of our transgenic candidates that were working with
5711780 but we believe that 0935 in combination with the nectariless trait bollgard ii and roundup ready flex can offer growers tools they can use in their production systems
5711781 we have so many new varieties in development that the three number identification system we had been using didnt work
5711782 our cotton breeders are currently evaluating some 400 lines for potential release in 2011
5711783 people have more or less abandoned cotton in some areas cotton has been a part of my life for a long time and im pleased that our company is continuing to invest in improving cotton yields and fiber quality
5711784 my job today is to try to build some excitement around cotton and the way im trying to do that is not only to talk about whats available today but also what will be available in 2009 and 2010
5711785 class of 2009 whats even more exciting is that every one of these varieties is being increased for seed for sale in 2009
5711786 monsantos decision and epa agreed was that at that point we would begin to transition away from bollgard to bollgard ii

5711788 while it has been a very difficult week i believe the end result is a very positive step forward for the galaxy

5711790 we have always felt that the galaxy should aspire to be the club that sets the pace and tone in major league soccer
5711791 i believe bruce sees it the same way and will put us back in that position
5711792 i am very excited to assume this position with the los angeles galaxy

5711809 for four months theoretically animals were not being properly treated and the humane society stood by and allowed it to happen
5711810 first and foremost the u s d a should not be relying on a private animal welfare charity to do its job for them
5711811 it is the height of irony that the u s d a is now trying to blame the whistle blower for the agencys own irresponsible behavior
5711812 the inadequacies of the inspection system how can so many downers have been mistreated day after day within a usda oversight system that was present at the plant we need more boots on the ground at the plants

5711853 it said that interested parties could bid for all or some of the pieces but encouraged bidders to make an offer for the whole business

5711892 partisan liberal democrats should have good reasons to fear the candidacy of ltc allen west

5711898 when i became president of dealers transmission exchange we occupied a healthy position with our existing marketplace the company has built a solid reputation over the past 30 years as a reliable trustworthy
5711899 but it was time to leverage that existing reputation and further open up the business to other markets on a global level dealers transmission exchange was reasonably competitive however in order to achieve the success that dte has experienced in the local marketplace new strategies for growth and improvement needed to be put in place
5711900 in times of economic instability customer service is paramount dealers transmission exchange has established a brand new sales and marketing division within the company to ensure that the customer is king first time every time
5711901 the new sales and marketing divisions second responsibility is to bring the latest proven products to our consumers they will steadily source and evaluate the best in industrial transmissions and other related products to add to our already extensive range

5711904 to demonstrate the high level of scalability and flexibility our software provides weve shifted gears to the ultra low end of the market

5711906 with our software running on intel atom processor based platform vendors can now deliver to the market place a mid based appliance running full ips at 400mbps for a cost of around 500 off the shelf
5711907 this kind of fully packaged ready to ship product is ideal for small businesses and enterprise deployment

5711932 as demand for content inspection continues to build intel quickassist technology will enable the industry to converge on a common api that is simple easy to support and provides deployment flexibility
5711933 the real american justice system is unlike anything depicted on law amp order and court tv
5711934 i know i was stunned when i realized that only about 5 percent of all felony convictions result from jury trials the rest are settled by plea bargains and these deals arent always to the defendants advantage
5711935 he was like pushing me to plead guilty and take the probation he wasnt on my side at all
5711936 even though i wasnt guilty i was willing to plead guilty because i had to go home to my kids my son was sick
5711937 one reason that a lot of people plead guilty is because theyre told they can go home that day because they will get probation
5711938 what they usually dont take into account is that they are being set up to fail
5711939 is to discourage plea bargaining by giving defendants an incentive to give up the jury only and take their case to a trial before a judge
5711940 what happens is that well over 50 percent of the cases are tried before a single judge about 5 percent of the cases go to a jury trial and again defendants know and lawyers know from experience that juries tend to react in certain ways to certain cases and that effects how judges will decide cases without a jury a judge knows that a jury wouldnt convict in a certain type of case he has to take that into account or no defendant would accept a trial before that judge at the same time the system can give slightly lower sentences the gap obviously doesnt have to be as great because the defendant isnt giving up as much this system has worked in practice very effectively for many many years so its not an imaginary idea and it essentially solves 99 or 100 percent of the problems weve been discussing
5711941 plan a is just spend the money were one of the richest nations on the planet and weve decided we cant afford to give criminal defendants their day in court theres got to be something wrong with that picture but the problem is that our trials are so over proceduralized that maybe we cant afford to do that plan b would be to simplify our trial procedures and thereby make trials more available to defendants who want them we dont need these prolonged jury selection procedures we dont need the complicated rules of evidence there are lots of other ways we could simplify criminal trials
5711942 in speed skating the pressure wasnt there but in cycling the pressure has been very high since the late 1980s i was exposed but lucky not to feel the pressure i dont think people understand the pressure a lot of these athletes are under especially in a third world country where you might make more than the prior three generations of your family i have a unique past and can let these guys know that at the end of the day you might not be able to look in the mirror if youve taken these drugs and beat the system look at bjarne riis the 1996 tour de france winner who returned his jersey
5711943 whenever i treat a high school athlete i always ask them what they are going to do with their life after sports just to really push him coming from me it probably has a bit more weight
5711944 im very lucky i didnt have to worry about making a living as a skater versus doing something else because at that time you couldnt make a living at it i was prepared for leaving the sport and having to do other things
5711945 when something comes easily like skating did for me you dont always realize that things wont always come easily i might not be the smartest guy out there but i learned from skating that if you stay focused you can accomplish a lot
5711946 they dont realize the anxiety that comes when youre done with your sport it is scary when you dont have people giving you direction

5712032 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5712033 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5712034 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5712035 the city is indebted to both strawbery banke and thomas berger for making sure this historic signpost was returned to portsmouth this piece of granite is an invaluable part of the citys historic fabric and both strawbery banke and mr berger have the citys deepest appreciation for their quick action once the piece was discovered

5712037 sales excluding the automotive sector rose 0 4 per cent
5712038 the increase in the automotive sector gave a boost to ontario where sales rose 4 2 per cent in june to 22 6 billion
5712039 this was the fourth consecutive rise in monthly sales in the province which accounts for around three quarters of all sales in the automotive sector
5712040 the wholesale sector is often somewhat overlooked in canada but it represents a reasonably important five per cent of the canadian economy and it tends to punch above its weight in terms of its relevance for gdp forecasting
5712041 although recent economic indicators have tended to be somewhat glum for canada there is an underpinning of support that has recently arisen from the unlikely trio of exporters manufacturers and wholesalers
5712042 when we use drugs you have to use it at the right dose too low a dose doesnt give you the effect you want too high a dose has the chance of producing too much of an effect or just basic toxicity
5712043 its a window you try and stay within in the first case we were worried about getting too much in now were worried about not getting enough in
5712044 if youre talking about substances that you have to have because of critical medical conditions like cancer or if you have had a kidney or some kind of transplant or if youve had a previous heart attack you have to get enough into the bloodstream to produce an effect
5712045 so if you want to get the most chance of having the most consistent uniform effect what you should really do is take your medication with a whole glass of water on an empty stomach
5712046 we had expected that the drug levels were going to go up in actual fact they went down that was a bit of a surprise to us
5712047 common orange juice which is probably drunk a lot more than grapefruit juice
5712048 but im sure well find many other drugs for which this happens
5712049 we had a hard time convincing people it really did exist the idea that food could produce this kind of effect was totally novel
5712050 we were kidded about it because grapefruit seems to be a humorous fruit and most people didnt know what to think

5712204 inadequate training for managing elderly patients unfamiliarity with protocol and possible age bias as the top three factors
5712205 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
5712206 eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias
5712207 when we felt the application was ready to be launched
5712208 we made the strategic decision to seek a partner who could help us with financing marketing and the general business structure
5712209 we will not be selling woopra at this early stage
5712210 we are still the owners i cannot enter into too many details at this moment as the program has only just been launched all i can say is that we have a very decent amount of funds compared to other start up projects like facebook or youtube
5712211 i then started learning about other tracking and analytics services and discovered success measuring methods other than just number of hits per day
5712212 by 2005 i realized that everything on the web was moving toward socializing and social networking everything except my analytics services google analytics still only offers numbers and statistics that wasnt enough for me i wanted to know more about who is viewing what on my virtual property whos stumbling on it how did they know about it was it possible to get in contact with them and perhaps even guide them
5712213 thats basically where i lived for a year for months we worked non stop often more than 15 hours per day sometimes we would finish work at 5am and join our friends for breakfast when they came back from a night out in batroun it didnt really bother us but i must admit our social life was totally screwed up
5712214 i dont think it is the task of a university to offer support for a project like woopra
5712215 the main role of the lau was teaching us the basics discipline and methodology a couple of teachers really supported us especially my supervisor dr munjid musallem what lebanese universities lack is the ability to make entrepreneurs they always prepare you to work in a company our universities are generally producing employees instead of creating long term inspirational projects
5712216 we have the worst internet connection in the middle east which is terrible yet this helped us to tackle the worst case scenarios and debug our code easier
5712217 this is not a compliment it is a shame really that at times we had to use a dial up modem because all the alternatives were down for days we had major problems rolling updates it used to take 4 to 6 hours to roll an update while in the us it takes less than five minutes the government has promised the adsl lines for 3 years yet we are still not able to set up an adsl account in byblos
5712218 throughout his first semester elie told me about his ideas that would later shape up to become woopra
5712219 woopra was elies brainchild and his primary obsession no one could have stopped him from pursuing his woopra side discussions about woopra were regular and naturally it was the subject of elies final graduation capstone project
5712220 jad clearly stood out when he presented the tradeoffs of client server versus multi tier and peer to peer design which is very important in the software architectures to which woopra subscribes
5712221 in short i consider myself the lucky teacher of two software gurus
5712222 the same happened with google yahoo mosaic the predecessor of netscape and many other products
5712223 but realistically some critical technologies do not take off until us based organizations give it their blessing and join in
5712224 there is much more technical expertise vision and entrepreneurial support in the usa than in any other place the database industry oracle sql server db2 is almost entirely located in the us even though many innovative database ideas have been emerging in europe for a very long time
5712225 we have a couple of drafts that we are trying to merge but we cannot reveal any further details for marketing and business reasons at this stage jad and i will continue development to keep woopra ahead of the competition while moving back and forth between lebanon and the us
5712226 much like menudo does or the blue man group i was going to hand the band over to this younger generation of revcos to sin quirin guitars josh bradford vocals and clayton worbeck keyboards kind of franchise it out i think that these three knuckleheads capture the true essence and spirit of being a revolting cock if you will but this album turned out so damned good i think im going to stick around for a while
5712227 as a matter of fact i think this is the best album including ministry pailhead lard anything ive ever done period production wise song wise im really really happy with this record its the first cd ive ever gotten back from the mastering studio that i didnt have anything to bitch about no complaints i listened to the whole thing and just went ok thats a wrap lets go

5712230 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
5712231 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
5712232 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
5712233 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
5712234 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
5712235 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
5712236 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
5712237 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
5712238 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
5712239 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
5712240 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
5712241 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
5712242 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
5712243 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
5712244 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
5712245 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
5712246 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

5712256 my lifestyle has changed a lot because on a saturday night when some of the guys go night clubbing and stuff i choose not to
5712257 during the season i look at my alcohol intake and i try not to drink any at all occasionally if theres a players do or something i might but its all controlled i dont overdo it
5712258 i think it will galvanise not only the players but also the city
5712259 it took me five years to get to the premier league after i left villa so it was a great day for me made even better by our first win
5712260 this is a different challenge for me at this level and it will be a magnificent achievement if the club can continue to build in the way it has done over the time i have been at hull
5712261 i dont want to lose any of the players i have at the moment but that doesnt stop other clubs from being interested in them
5712262 weve heard nothing from reading and at the moment it is purely paper talk
5712263 chris has had a scan and has been given the all clear to return to training and will be available for selection on saturday

5712266 i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back
5712267 he is very happy and is looking forward to playing in the premier league with west bromwich albion we believe this is a great opportunity for him
5712268 i knew i was looking for someone who was going to get us goals and im sure hell do just that with the service hell be getting
5712269 hes not blessed with a massive amount of pace but hes an aerial threat and a poacher and thats what i think were lacking
5712270 i told him that i was very ambitious and the only way that i can have my ambitions met is by winning and youre only going to win by scoring goals

5712276 the process is thoroughly explained as well as exercised in these meetings
5712277 we had our first real selection session around two weeks ago which went very well
5712278 with the supplemental funding congress has provided i believe the amount of road construction that will take place is truly a transformation thing
5712279 the roads will improve transportation and stimulate economic opportunity and prosperity they will make for easier access to market for the farmers which make up the majority of the population
5712280 we will also ideally be putting hundreds of local people to work building the roads
5712281 many have expressed that both the process and the resulting selection of contractors are a strong mechanism for empowering and promoting participation and decision making
5712282 the people are so happy they are so glad we have a radio station
5712283 everyone you see is talking about the radio theyre calling on the phone to ask for songs or introduce themselves or read some poetry
5712284 every wednesday theres a bazaar in nengaresh where people bring in their animals to sell
5712285 they come from all the villages and were going to interview these people to find out what they want what they need and find out what kind of problems they have
5712286 it is with great sorrow that we must announce this brave soldiers death as we offer our sympathies to this soldiers loved ones
5712287 we have the utmost respect and admiration for the isaf troops who operate in this challenging environment
5712288 we have given local communities the choice of directly elected mayors for their towns and where adopted some elected mayors have proved effective and popular with residents we have recently legislated to give all councils a choice between mayors and indirectly elected council leaders and will consult on making it easier for local people to decide to have a mayor however labour recognises that indirectly elected council leaders can provide superb leadership and as such we will not seek to impose elected mayors we will include in our consultation the process whereby a decision to have a directly elected mayor can be reversed by referendum or vote of the council
5712289 academic selection at 11 is socially divisive and can damage self esteem achievement and development local parents can vote to remove selection at local grammar schools and it is right that such decisions are made locally
5712290 we will work with the cbi unions and others to gather evidence of the effectiveness of promoting best practice on equal pay audits

5712294 we will oppose any attempts to create an eu single market for healthcare which could undermine the nhs
5712295 these plans are being implemented on a pilot basis and their success and acceptability will determine how rapidly the full biometric database and accompanying id cards will be rolled out
5712296 government recognises the need for reform of the system of council housing finance which is why we have launched a review of the housing revenue account subsidy system the review will address a wide range of issues including subsidy rents management and maintenance major repairs and borrowing labour recognises the need particularly in a more difficult housing market to have a mixed economy of housing providers and believes that local authorities and almos as well as housing associations have a key role to play in the future of affordable housing provision the review is considering how we can ensure councils have a sustainable long term system for financing their housing in particular how we can work with local authorities to ensure stock is of a decent standard as well as providing the social and affordable homes including council houses we need in the future
5712297 the central role of the public sector in delivering public services
5712298 it makes clear that direct provision should be the preferred option and that privatisation is not the way ahead
5712299 160 billion is spent by the public sector on private sector contracts the equality duty will require public bodies to give due regard to the need to tackle discrimination and promote equality through their purchasing functions we will use our purchasing power to help private sector contractors to contribute to the delivery of our public policy objectives of greater equality
5712300 despite progress in reducing poverty under this government the current wealth gap between rich and poor is still too large there is growing evidence that social strains and ill health are greater in more unequal societies independent of overall wealth reducing inequality will contribute to the development of a fairer society we are committed to narrowing inequalities in society tackling the gap between rich and poor and eradicating child poverty a progressive tax and benefit system has an important part to play

5712309 there was a question mark last year about apple that maybe it had taken its eye off the ball by concentrating on the iphone but now the iphone and ipod and mac are nicely aligned
5712310 most of apples windows based competition is suffering a bit from vista
5712311 complaints about vista are generating complaints about the computer makers
5712312 people know there have been some service and product quality problems but apple has an almost teflon like quality its problems dont really seem to matter to consumers
5712313 most lose it slowly like dell has which took a while and we see companies improve but apples extreme volatility is almost like its stock price
5712314 apple will be very difficult to catch but i dont think that these results where theres a 10 point difference will hold
5712315 my guess is that they will regroup at some point and come back
5712316 its time for a recap and update for whats on tap with forbidden
5712317 first of all we want to let everyone that went to our shows in europe and gave of all of that love thank you

5712319 speaking of paul well be playing two shows with testament and voivod one of my all time influences
5712320 but before we go to japan were going to be doing our last bay area appearance at slims on september 12th
5712321 ive been joking with the guys and saying well it seems like the worlds about to implode again like it did back in the 80s its so fn true there is plenty of things that will help motivate us into making a record with the sense of urgency that will inspire something that we hope will turn out special we will give it our best shot and see what we come up with ive already been writing riffs and lyrics and i have to say its going pretty well there is a lot of fire now and we intend on using it but none of that will be worth anything if we all dont come together and put forth our best effort to date its worth a try
5712322 im just praying for the gwatney family its just beyond belief a horribly sad sad state of affairs
5712323 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
5712324 he was a long time friend of mine a caring compassionate individual with strong convictions who worked hard every day
5712325 its just senseless senseless he meant a lot to me and i talked to him and visited with him as late as thursday he was a visionary always looking forward a great guy i cant say enough about him he was a dear friend
5712326 we havent seen anything like this before where a company scores 10 points over its nearest rival

5712331 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
5712332 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
5712333 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
5712334 even if china goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
5712335 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
5712336 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
5712337 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
5712338 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s

5712340 theres nothing new monday on fannie or freddie that made me worry
5712341 the barrons argument simply rehashed old arguments and did not offer numbers to support what they were saying
5712342 weve crunched the numbers and we think fannie and freddie have sufficient capital to make it through
5712343 weaker than expected results across the board and bigger write downs than we had projected
5712344 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
5712345 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary

5712358 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5712360 yes but only because i have access to the internet and western media outlets

5712362 im taking the view that we need maximums we cannot afford to have an increase in the number of autos and vmt as described in the report even if their estimates are high we need
5712363 imagining seatless subway cars sounds horrible cant believe how bad the 6 line is already and their solution is to cram more people in there
5712364 larry i think your proposal is worth a shot and worthy of inclusion in the report however it would have to be tied to a reduction in the minimum spaces required as it wouldnt
5712365 larry the rental car facility in place of parking garage is intriguing but doesnt address the main points raised by the report off street parking induces auto demand and

5712372 one explanation might be that theres a group of consumers thats holding off making do with the devices that they have either because of larger economic concerns or because they dont see any value yet in the new voice and data services that are driving some of these new handsets
5712373 simple solution is to return the device to the store provider from which it was purchased and demand repair or replacement
5712374 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5712375 my determination remains intact france is resolved to pursue the fight against terrorism for democracy and liberty the cause is just it is the honour of france and its armies to defend it
5712376 its great for them to try and do different things there
5712377 its nice to be able to recognize that there are two official languages and cultures in this country by having students able to actually hear french around them
5712378 its great to pass the love of french on to others as one of my teachers really influenced me in learning the language
5712379 dominique henry was a great teacher he taught french at windsor regional because he had such high standards for students
5712380 now hes dedicated to his teaching studies and his students
5712381 when you come from a small town like windsor you dont have much perspective on the reset of the world

5712390 the hungarian boxing association would like to foster close links with our namibian counterparts and see where we can accommodate each other with the ultimate view of forming diplomatic relations between the two countries
5712391 in hungary we have fourteen boxing promoters and very good referees and umpires and some of them are currently doing duty at the beijing olympics our government is very supportive and has pumped lots of money into the development of boxing i must confess i was extremely impressed by the standard of the referees on saturday they really acquitted themselves well and were spot on with their decisions

5712393 how could google ever possibly know it was me who was clicking
5712394 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
5712395 everywhere i go people have told me im getting nervous
5712396 i have to just remind people that it is true that just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics and the same people who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5712397 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5712398 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5712399 mccains worth over 100 million he owns 10 houses he flies around on a 12 6 million corporate jet he walks around in 520 italian loafers
5712400 if john mccain lost his social security hed get by just fine would you
5712401 they need to draw a clearer contrast and not be shy or flinch from doing it
5712402 hes running a commercial now that says mccain voted with bush 95 percent of the time on what and what about all the flip flops
5712403 mccain is actually profoundly vulnerable to a powerful aggressive and damaging attack on his character
5712404 you always have a group of people in washington whose political profession is to get nervous during elections
5712405 mccain has failed to put forward a positive case for a mccain presidency hes entrenched himself in this administration and thats going to turn into the biggest strategic blunder of this campaign
5712406 democrats because weve burned in the last few elections get nervous and skittish right around this time
5712407 they say oh no here the republicans come theyre so mean and theyre going to be doing all these things

5712429 what if you want to install something not in the package manager
5712430 what if you want to install something not in the package manager windows beats linus hands down
5712431 pacman kde4 and it was soon downloaded and installed and worked honestly how much simpler can you get
5712432 first of all lets face it you are the weakest link in any os
5712433 finally just the fact that linux is open source means that more eyeballs can see bugs and vulnerabilities making it easier to patch any coder in his her moms basement could issue a fix for the community
5712434 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5712435 i am sure when it comes to community other proprietary operating systems do envy us
5712436 long story short after around 2 hours of trying to get an hp printer to work on xp i gave up and plugged into an ubuntu linux eee pc it got recognized in 30 seconds
5712437 it would be a totally different ball game if these pcs had no os on them windows wouldnt come out all that superior i would even wager that linux would probably do a better job
5712438 unlike windows where u have to download a seperate driver for your monitor graphic card chip set keyboard etc
5712439 if a linux installation fail to install a hardware on a system i could just give up right away on windows go to the hardware vendors website and download and install the driver
5712440 when linux fil to install some hardware you often have to do
5712441 download packages type in weird commands that meant i had to download some more stuff as i said weird stuff that i cant remember because of its weirdness
5712442 at the most i used linux for about a month and a half before i went back to windows
5712443 weird stuff that i cant remember because of its weirdness
5712444 i imagine someone who had only been using windows or mac os x for a month and a half
5712445 and one morning i woke up and decided knew that d amp d was my favorite game
5712446 the golden rule applies to all rpgs the dm gm is always right
5712447 the generic fantastic world in which pcs go on adventures makes absolutely no sense and its perfect like that i wouldnt want it to change
5712448 whatever strikes me as a good plot hook can be justified in a split second i can make up spells cataclysmic events weird monsters whatever and i dont need to justify it my players will never bat an eyelash at the weirdness of it all
5712449 having rigid rules set forth for xp and damage and chances to find stuff takes the onus of responsibility for plot development away from the dm and gives it to the dice
5712450 is the game always giving folks what they want to keep them happy
5712451 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
5712452 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
5712453 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
5712454 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
5712455 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
5712456 the farmer can go on and produce whatever they produce we remove the allergen through processing rather than breeding of the peanut itself
5712457 this is again performed endoscopically with a device that goes down the esophagus into the stomach where the device is deployed the theory is food goes on the inside of this endobarrier the digestive enzymes are on the outside of the endobarrier and the food and digestive enzymes dont mix until two feet further down stream in the smaller bowel
5712458 for now its not instead of its prior too gastric bypass whether or not this becomes a procedure instead of gastric bypass remains to be seen
5712459 we do not believe there is a link between printer emissions and any public health risk
5712460 the best scientific evidence available indicates that zinc lozenges are not effective in treating colds
5712461 wal mart has staked out the position with its save money live better tagline that they are the king of low prices
5712462 well save you money and well help your family make it through these economic times
5712463 are you a shapeshifter because you seem more beautiful every time i look at you
5712464 you must not be pushy because im feeling a strong pull in your direction
5712465 im like a slime mold attracted to beauty and im sliding in your direction
5712466 you must be some sort of rogue because you keep shifting my eyes towards yours
5712467 if i were a gelatinous cube id slide over and engulf you
5712468 lets shift into my pants no wait i said that wrong sex involves pushing and sliding lets have sex
5712469 hey if you had shifted the dragon to square x before using the breath attack you could have caught 4 characters instead of 3

5712471 we could have sold many more tickets but for security reasons we had to limit the entrance to 10 000 people per day
5712472 its not only about stamps but also about their historic importance and the huge value they represent
5712473 and our chinese visitors real fans in this field just love them
5712474 if youre in last place you try to win all your games if youre in first place you try to win all your games you just do the best you can and see what happens
5712475 we havent finished strong i wish i had the formula for that id bottle it and sell it
5712476 even when youve won a big 12 championship the year before or back to back it means nothing now everybodys after the same thing once again and its your job to go try and earn it
5712477 lets focus on illinois and getting better every day thats pretty much all we talk about
5712478 these players have been through a lot the seniors had three different staffs in their first three years
5712479 we havent finished strong i wish i had the formula for that id bottle it and sell it
5712480 we just have to improve how we play later in the season thats not to say that we will just coast and then turn it on i think we just need to make plays
5712481 im very confident in myself with the offense and with the guys around me
5712482 i think theres pressure that we need to compete better and prove that we are better than we showed in the past
5712483 i want to get this place going where it should be
5712484 im real satisfied when we get a chance to play a school like texas and next year we have kansas coming in here
5712485 its pretty fun playing here in the sun bowl if i hadnt been there if i hadnt if i was younger id probably yearn for that opportunity
5712486 the kids confidence level is very high much higher than its ever been i tell the kids all the time if you have confidence you can take challenges on in life
5712487 the biggest challenge without a doubt is i feel like when people havent had a lot of success a lot of times theyre scared of success
5712488 a place to really have a chance for a great accomplishment
5712489 our whole objective our whole mindset has to be now
5712490 we need to take advantage of now were not worrying about 09 10 or 11 weve got 08
5712491 there are definitely some teams that will be surprised this year
5712492 weve got things we want to do as a team
5712493 you cant go into a situation thinking or expecting bad things to happen
5712494 these guys are really doing a good job studying well competing well leading well
5712495 its a situation we feel were very fortunate so were not spending a lot of time discussing that position
5712496 you want to prove everybody wrong and you want them to start believing if we can go out there and do that then i think everybodys view of us would change theyll stop ranking us in the same spot every year in the big 12 south between baylor and tech or somebody
5712497 slowly we can start creeping our way up there but we have to earn everybodys respect before that can happen
5712498 we couldnt get to the passer and we couldnt stop the run
5712499 the teams that have won it in the past have played good defense were aware of that
5712500 but you also better be able to score in this league because the majority of the teams in this league can score a lot of points

5712502 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5712503 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5712504 our second quarter earnings per share modestly exceeded our expectations despite continued soft sales trends
5712505 you know one thing will happen with the online tools the open source commnuity will work at matching then out performing the wotc softwares all in all were winners

5712507 part 1 means that chatty will grace us with an epic 10 000 words series on the subject which is great because he is always on the money i cant get enough of his blog vote for dungeon mastering please
5712508 okay now im out of spells what do i do now thwack something with my low strength
5712509 in essence the judge appears to conclude that fox retained distribution rights in watchmen through the 1991 largo quitclaim and he concludes that under the 1994 turnaround producer larry gordon acquired an option to acquire foxs remaining interest in watchmen that was never exercised thereby leaving fox with its rights under the 1994 agreement
5712510 while the judges opinion is preliminary and his views could change in the course of the litigation his current take on the facts is consistent with our position
5712511 the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation the judge did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
5712512 fox sat on its so called rights for years while other studios in town developed this property fox even had an opportunity to re acquire the project at some point and it passed on it
5712513 everybody else has these different feelings or aspirations about what he should do or not do all were asking him to do is come in and embrace our culture which is be a great person graduate and help us win a national championship
5712514 that day is going to come there is no question
5712515 im not rushing that i just want him to know where to line up and how to take a handoff hes been great hes been jumping in on all kinds of special teams he wants to play that
5712516 well see im not rushing him im not putting any pressure on him to lead us to the next level i just want him to do all the right things and have fun and do things right
5712517 because were going to have some great running backs with a great ability to run the ball but were also going to have some playmaking wide receivers who can move down the field as well
5712518 darrell is a power speed back ray is more of a slasher type of guy and rodney is just a blur
5712519 that dude is so quick when he runs i dont think his heels ever touch the ground hes constantly moving forward
5712520 i dont think its burden i like it it puts colorado back out in the national scene and thats all you can ask for
5712521 darrells a humble kid he knows there is no such thing as entitlement he has to work hard in order to achieve the success that hes had before hes come in and he fits right in with the guys the guys like him they call him five star its a good match
5712522 im just adjusting to the altitude the altitude is tough but im good i just water down my body and get as many reps as i can
5712523 i never thought there would ever be a time in my lifetime that the football coach at kansas would have to defend his schedule after beating nebraska texas a amp m colorado and virginia tech
5712524 there was a time when it was hard for kansas to show up for those games let alone win them
5712525 we want to be able to play against all the best teams in our league
5712526 and be able to beat them thats the test for our program we will never truly get over the hump in my eyes until were able to defeat those teams as well
5712527 but we are up to the challenge we cant wait to get out there and show the fans that last year wasnt a fluke were the jayhawks and were for real now
5712528 i think now we have a lot of confidence in ourselves
5712529 not that we lacked confidence before but we really expect to be on the big stage now
5712530 it takes a while to where we are winning some games its going to take hard work to keep winning games our success didnt happen overnight we dont feel like there is any chance of a falloff because our guys didnt just luck into something
5712531 when youre sitting in an area thats right in the middle of what we used to call the state of miami we now call it florida atlantic territory you ought to be able to recruit very good football players
5712532 and if you can recruit very good football players what would keep you from being great it just makes no sense
5712533 howard schnellenberger if hed never left the university of miami hed have more national championships than anybody ever
5712534 thats my opinion i really believe it i think hes probably one of the best football coaches ever
5712535 what our coaches have done what our players have done what ive done its exemplary
5712536 we now are going into each of our games with the idea and with the avowed knowledge that we can compete and we can win each of those non conference games
5712537 we accomplished a lot last year but we want to take that next step
5712538 winning the new orleans bowl was a great achievement but we want to accomplish greater things this season we expect to win the conference and are shooting for a bcs bowl
5712539 weve talked about how to conduct ourselves socially and we continue to work hard towards that
5712540 certainly our players have an understanding that the incidents that happened this summer we are not proud of and it is not going to continue
5712541 im excited about our running backs theres going to be some young speed guys who work hard
5712542 to build our team with the young skill guys that we have
5712543 i would much rather come into a new situation where we have experience on the offensive front and experience on the defensive front and have young inexperience at the skill positions because we know the offensive line and the defensive line really control the game
5712544 they give the quarterback an opportunity to have some time and space to throw the ball
5712545 i tell our guys life asks you to be your best every day but our schedule demands it
5712546 i know exactly where he is going to be i dont ever have to worry about him running the wrong route or taking seven steps when he should take six hes a guy that knows where hes supposed to be and he knows exactly where im going to throw it
5712547 i can tell by his eyes if im open or not if somebodys on my tail
5712548 if he gives me those eyes i know its coming and ill just run with him its just natural between us
5712549 i think we were better in the spring than we were at any point all of last season
5712550 having the same coaching staff for two years is huge for us
5712551 ill be a much better head coach here in than in year one because i know what this team is capable of doing now
5712552 i reflect back on some of the decisions i made last year even offensively when we lined up in power sets to play power football that is not who we are
5712553 it was a shock for every czech because up until the last minute we just had no idea though it is true that in the czech press agency we had an inkling of what might happen because we knew that russian soldiers had been doing drill in the czech forests since june some west german photographers had shown us images of the troops but mere mortals had no clue that these soldiers had come to train and never left afterwards but even then for us for everyone august 21 was an absurd shock
5712554 i started work at 5 in the morning i lived five minutes away from the central committee of the communist party where overnight they had arrested dub ek and so i took my camera and ran over there as soon as it was light around 8 in the morning it started to get a bit dangerous soldiers started shooting at civilians and i think two people died the action moved towards wenceslas square and the czech radio building as tradition dictates so by late morning i was taking photos outside the radio building

5712600 patients managed medically without stenting or bypass surgery tend to be elderly and frail and in some sense we feel they have been overlooked

5712602 it is important to know that the patients in the medically managed group had a higher death rate despite receiving most of the currently recommended medications for this condition from clinical practice guidelines
5712603 there are often very good reasons why stenting or bypass are not viable options for some patients what this study tells us is that for these patients who are medically managed we need to come up with better treatment approaches that lessen their risk of death

5712716 revel entertainment ceo kevin desanctis and his team are building the worlds greenest casino resort and certainly one of the most beautiful
5712717 icrete is proud to play a featured role on the resort construction team part of a broad effort by environmentally conscious executives pursing leed certification in the u s and abroad
5712718 meeting the leed certification standards of the u s green building council has become a principal objective for the designers and builders of large public projects and infrastructure in new jersey and across the country
5712719 icretes technology has allowed us to fully optimize the use of resources for the revel site reduce the carbon footprint of the construction effort and help revel meet its leed goals we are pleased to be able to offer in atlantic city unique concrete mixes like those from icrete that support the leed process

5712721 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
5712722 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
5712723 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
5712724 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
5712725 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns

5712732 our officers in conjunction with the correctional officers at the county jail arrested transported and booked the suspect into the county jail its incomprehensible to us that lyons failed at the court hearing to demand forfeiture of akulas passport to the sheriffs department as a condition of his bond this mistake allowed the suspect to flee the country lyons mishandling of the case is an embarrassment to law enforcement in peoria
5712733 the situation in peoria heights continues a pattern of neglect in the states attorneys office that worsens our crime problems and demoralizes law enforcement
5712734 in case after case the officers deputies investigators and detectives at the local departments have done their jobs they have arrested and detained suspects they have imprisoned convicts and they have worked very hard on the frontlines to make peoria county safer the problem time and again has been in the prosecutors office in the peoria heights case the states attorney did not know what to do to keep an international suspect in peoria in other situations he has been too liberal with plea bargains and ultimately soft on crime no wonder we have the highest crime rate in the state over the past five years i am committed to working in tandem with peoria law enforcement i will take a hard line on criminals and together we will make peoria a safer place for us all its time for a change in the states attorneys office

5712861 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
5712862 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the twenty first century
5712863 today we start a new chapter of paraguayan history whose authorities will be relentless against the thieves in their communities
5712864 all the oil paraguay needs in this century venezuela has and venezuela guarantees to supply paraguay right to the last drop for the development of paraguays people industry and agriculture

5712869 i cannot stop one human being even a presidential candidate from admiring the courage and sacrifice of peaceful protesters on the edmund pettus bridge or making comments about it
5712870 hmmm vote for the guy that promises to give me more welfare or the guy that wants to cut government spending
5712871 someone answered for this in terms of the death penalty
5712872 for all the fault he does bear for keerans untimely death wood does not deserve to die
5712873 he has never taken a human life by his own hands
5712874 we certainly would eyeball foster as an example why he should not be executed
5712875 if it was good enough for foster its certainly good enough for us
5712876 longstanding mental illness that allowed him to be easily manipulated

5712878 take the word shit does it mean a pile of faeces or something is rubbish
5712879 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5712880 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5712881 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5712882 under well established laws designed to protect children and families
5712883 if i were designing a system from scratch i would probably go ahead with a single payer system
5712884 given that a lot of people work for insurance companies a lot of people work for hmos youve got a whole system of institutions that have been set up
5712885 they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
5712886 we now believe that an unidentified male rented a room from the couple on or about august 1 this year
5712887 mr yang informed his mother that the new lodger was a student and that he came from the jinzhou area of the northern seaport city dalian we know little of who this lodger was we do not know whether he had yet moved in and whether he lived there at the time of the killings
5712888 we have no further information to identify the lodger and inquiries to trace him have so far failed if they have moved in then they may know things about the victims lifestyles arguments they may have had or visitors to the flat
5712889 inquiries are continuing into allegations of internet betting scams and the obtaining of fraudulent university qualifications
5712890 as to potential motives for the killings some people may wrongly have assumed that they brought it on themselves and that may be stopping people from coming forward
5712891 but they were not involved in high level stuff there was no printing press for forged documents no racketeering
5712892 they did not have a jet set lifestyle they were living in a small flat in the west end of newcastle involved in low level stuff which does not point towards justifying why these murders have happened
5712893 the level of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couples computer thus far
5712894 we must not lose sight of the fact that xi zhou and zhen xing yang are victims of a senseless killing and their parents and friends are left devastated and unable to comprehend what has happened
5712895 bringing belarus into the fold of european democracies is a priority and the release of political prisoners an unfaltering demand
5712896 is revealing of the dynamics within the belarusian leadership and of the willingness of at least part of it to engage in a dialogue with european institutions and to respond positively to their demands
5712897 it is a common achievement of belarusian human right defenders and various foreign structures both governmental and nongovernmental
5712898 we also contributed our part so for me this news was cause for a lot of joy id like this trend to be continued after kazulin because there are two more political prisoners in belarus
5712899 certainly mr kazulin even without the official post of leader of his party is already an important factor in belarusian politics
5712900 it is up to him how he is going to dispose of his potential that he gained thanks to his courage
5712901 episode probably traumatized him worse than the time the trashmen went on strike or the time he was forced to teach children
5712902 i am devastated that due to the loss of a major investor in the harsh reality of a slowing economy there were no other options at this time than to postpone i could not in good conscience move forward without full confidence that the capitalization was in place and that all of those employed by the production could be responsibly taken care of
5712903 even in light of the situation my passion for this vibrant production is unwavering and it is my goal to regroup as soon as possible
5712904 i take comfort in my belief that productions happen when they are supposed to the cast and creative team was poised to create a terrific production and i have no doubt it will be just that when its time comes
5712905 burning more coal is too big a risk for too many people
5712906 coal is the single largest source of global warming pollution in the u s with power plants responsible for 33 percent of co2 emissions because of this pollution we already face increasingly severe heat waves and droughts intensifying hurricanes and floods disappearing glaciers and more wildfires if left unchecked the effects will be catastrophic to us and our planet
5712907 we will be active in opposing the building of these plants
5712908 coal fired electric power plants have a very long lifespan and contribute huge amounts of pollution to the atmosphere building these new plants would foreclose the possibility of preventing dangerous global warming
5712909 many hope that co2 can be captured and stored underground
5712910 but this technology has never been demonstrated on a commercial scale
5712911 instead of coal we must look to clean energy alternatives
5712912 california which has been a leader in energy conservation and efficiency has been able to keep per capita energy consumption essentially constant for three decades while enjoying a growing economy
5712913 wind and solar are also ready to make large contributions to economic growth
5712914 environmental initiatives that include reductions in greenhouse gases investments in additional renewable energy resources and the retirement of older less efficient generation
5712915 the whole argument that coal would be a terrible thing for an environment was wrong
5712916 i just reviewed this dog of a manuscript for the journal of

5712928 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5712929 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5712930 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head
5712931 i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section this was yet another ominous sign
5712932 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot

5712938 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5712939 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5712940 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5712941 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5712942 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5712943 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5712944 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5712945 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5712946 there are these changes in the south atlantic an area where the magnetic field has the smallest envelope at one third of what is normal
5712947 if there are magnetic storms and high energy particles coming from the sun the satellites could be affected and their connections could be lost
5712948 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5712949 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5712950 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5712951 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
5712952 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5712953 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming

5712956 what im trying to do now in my later years is fight everybody who violates my rights the feminazis have infiltrated institutions and theres been a transfer of rights from guys to girls
5712957 a bastion of bigotry against men that demonizes men and exalts women in order to justify discrimination against men based on collective guilt columbia has thrown its influence and prestige into violating the rights of men by offering a womens studies program but no mens studies program spreading prejudice and fostering animosity and distrust toward men with the result of the wholesale violation of mens rights due to ignorance falsehoods and malice
5712958 help battle the infringement of mens rights by the feminists and their allies

5712970 the work they are doing fits into where we see where things are going
5712971 provide program support to researchers from the hormel institute mayo clinic and the university of minnesota
5712972 i think this is a manifestation of the new approach that mayo is taking to develop a strong set of partnerships collaborations and alliances

5712981 the best college is one that helps the student find his or her place in society and prepare for a life of contribution and career
5712982 each college whether a small liberal arts school a research university an elite university or a focused or vocational college has its own goals strengths character situation and culture students are most likely to be successful at a school where they really fit in and are happy about their choice
5712983 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus

5712987 according to the survey results bartenders in denver should know that theyll hear better toasts while the bartenders in minneapolis wont need as much ice with their patrons ordering drinks straight up
5712988 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5712989 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
5712990 like all dirty energy sources tar sands are an economic and environmental dead end
5712991 at a time when we should be aggressively reducing our greenhouse gas emissions oil and gas companies are instead planning to deepen our dependency of one of the dirtiest of energy sources available
5712992 less dirty but even more dangerous is the impact on the climate weve simply got to leave this carbon in the ground
5712993 we want drivers to think before they fill their tank
5712994 do you really want to buy a product that will make the world a more difficult place for your children
5712995 the destruction of the first nations clean air water and wildlife is a global tragedy that is being fueled by our wasteful habits
5712996 if the u s required cars to get 40 miles per gallon we could save enough gas to make tar sands imports unnecessary
5712997 a recent study conducted done for a superfund cleanup showed an elevated rate of cancer in our neighborhood
5712998 weve got a giant refinery here pumping toxins into our neighborhood yet the government seems to think any cancer is our own fault theyve allowed suncor to expand production from 60 000 to 90 000 barrels a day now suncor wants to up its refining of this heavy dirty crude when will it end
5712999 in maine traditional methods of restoring atlantic salmon by stocking fish have not been very successful with only 0 68 per cent returning
5713000 with the tagged salmon we can track more fish further into the ocean than ever before and get meaningful results
5713001 were not sure where they go in between but were hoping to find that out
5713002 the salmon crossing the line is evidence that the network is working
5713003 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5713004 broad scale ocean arrays such as the otn halifax line are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5713005 salmon are an iconic fish but theyre becoming endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5713006 this is the first step to finding out where in the ocean the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5713007 everyone figured that the acaricides anti varroa mite chemicals would be present in the wax because the wax is reprocessed to form the structure of the hives
5713008 it was a bit of a shock to see the levels and the widespread presence of these pesticides
5713009 we already had in place ways to test for viruses bacteria and fungi but it was difficult to find an analytical laboratory that could analyze for unknown pesticides
5713010 we needed them to take a comprehensive look at all pesticides not just those associated with beekeeping
5713011 when we began doing this work honey was not regularly analyzed and bee pollen was not a commodity and so was not analyzed
5713012 we decided to go with the types of screening the lab does for milk and apples which look at over 170 pesticides now honey is included in the commodities to be analyzed
5713013 simplicity was important because there were many people across the country sampling for us
5713014 now rather than having them collect 15 grams of pollen they need only collect 3 grams
5713015 gamma radiation is often used to kill viruses and other disease causing agents
5713016 we are finding fungicides that function by inhibiting the steroid metabolism in the fungal diseases they target but these chemicals also affect similar enzymes in other organisms
5713017 these fungicides in combination with pyrethroids and or neonicotinoids can sometimes have a synergistic effect 100s of times more toxic than any of the pesticides individually
5713018 we do not know that these chemicals have anything to do with colony collapse disorder but they are definitely stressors in the home and in the food sources
5713019 pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of ccd we believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors possibly including mites viruses and pesticides
5713020 we now want to look at small versus large operations and organic versus nonorganic operations to see if there are differences
5713021 none of us are not about investing in future services but we believe we have a very good model of primary care and we believe the polyclinic model will actively try to undermine the current practice
5713022 we have enough practices in north yorkshire every patient can find a good gp and we have the highest satisfactory levels in the country and to try and duplicate and cherry pick patients from practices will destabilise and undermine them
5713023 in the upper right corner perhaps a homeless man or woman has left a not about to be careful should you sleep there
5713024 when youre fighting in the ufc and fighting a caliber of guy like that youre gonna lose and youre gonna have tough fights theres no way around it
5713025 but when youre fighting guys on a smaller show waiting for a big call you cant afford to lose id be set to fight a tough local guy and maybe hed get hurt and so a last minute replacement would come in someone i wouldnt know a lot about and maybe he doesnt have a great record but he might be dangerous enough to beat me and then if i lose i set myself back a year
5713026 the guys at 170 just hit harder than im used to so if i want to be careless against a welterweight then chances are i can get clipped and hurt a lot more than against a lightweight
5713027 of course there are some lightweights that can hit hard too but it was just something i wasnt used to fighting a guy with good boxing skills that could also hurt me with punches
5713028 theyve shown the fight on ufc unleashed and i got about 15 text messages
5713029 i was actually praying the night of the fight that the frank mir brock lesnar fight would go a little longer so they wouldnt have time to show it
5713030 you couldnt tell from the lytle fight because there wasnt a lot of fight time and we didnt tie up too much but ill be just as strong if not stronger than lauzon and ill have the confidence to throw with him and not have to worry about getting clipped by one of his big punches when you see me on my game and when things are going well for me youll see somebody who has knockout power in both hands fast combinations and whos athletic as far as my wrestling and my ground game im not gonna sit back and play guard im fighting hard to get back up and fighting hard to do damage to my opponent from any position i just try to be damaging and i want them to quit before its time for me to beat em
5713031 so it makes you appreciate it when the biggest organization in the world the ufc is gonna spend time to put you on a card and match you up and you want to do right by them too
5713032 i think those early losses to those tough fighters held me back
5713033 to move up youve got to fight tough guys but i fought them too early in my career with not enough experience i didnt work my way up i went from fighting guys who i outmatched to jumping in there with guillard or varner and they were all close fights but i just wasnt mentally prepared for fighting someone at that level at that time but having been there and seen what ive done with them and training with some of the guys ive trained with since then its really given me confidence
5713034 what if i come in there reel off a few wins in a row and people start talking about me as an up and coming fighter in the ufc maybe that will put the loss to lytle in perspective and show that anything can happen

5713038 zlatan is not likely to play the full 90 minutes but maybe 45 minutes
5713039 he feels stronger and stronger he had a knee injury but hes recovering very well and has played 90 minutes with inter so he looks good and is confident for the season
5713040 henrik larsson is still a great player he is probably the best player in the swedish league he is a very strong player
5713041 as he henry is here and pat patrick viera injured isnt thierry has all the qualities and skills to be captain but in the future that remains to be seen
5713042 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it this platform we are at today sits above a field of 160 million barrels of oil and is capable of producing on a daily basis 55 000 barrels of oil and 72 million cubic feet of natural gas

5713045 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution
5713046 the intensification of clashes between the jvp and the upfa is an indication of a rise in tensions in the search for votes between the two parties in the sabaragamuwa province

5713060 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5713061 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5713062 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation

5713082 new left movement and its key activists who spout revolution and unlawfully challenge society to obtain their demands
5713083 the purpose of this program is to expose disrupt and otherwise neutralize the activities of the various new left organizations their leadership and adherents it is imperative that the activities of these groups be followed on a continuous basis so we may take advantage of all opportunities for counterintelligence and also inspire action where circumstances warrant
5713084 consideration must be given to disrupting the organized anarchistic activity of these groups the devious maneuvers and duplicity of whose activists can paralyze institutions of learning induction centers cripple traffic and tie the arms of law enforcement officials to the detriment of our society law and order is mandatory for any civilization to survive

5713096 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning
5713097 i would like to believe that people have more respect for the elderly
5713098 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5713099 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5713100 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5713101 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5713102 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5713103 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5713104 signing this initiative does serious harm to the education and enforcement efforts on our campuses and ultimately endangers young lives even more
5713105 i ask every higher education leader who has signed to reconsider i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
5713106 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5713107 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5713108 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5713109 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5713110 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5713111 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5713112 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5713113 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning
5713114 the peace we currently enjoy should not be taken for granted
5713115 some political parties are disrupting this peace all peace loving zambians must rise and say no to all those preaching violence and chaos in this country
5713116 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china
5713117 it was a murder with intention he murdered her in anger because she refused to part with the gadget
5713118 we were always worried about students bringing such gadgets to the school
5713119 we have issued several notices and given enough warnings asking them not to bring ipods and cell phones to class
5713120 persistent shelling in this area where two weeks ago a large number of internally displaced people sought refuge forced them to move again further inside kilinochchi
5713121 such multiple displacements are also adding to the delays in providing adequate shelter
5713122 many of the internally displaced people who are yet to receive temporary shelter and are thus still living under trees are struggling to seek shelter from the rain
5713123 sri lanka is a unique case of a government maintaining its offices and funding the administration in territories unlawfully occupied by a terrorist group
5713124 plans are under way to settle them in shelters located in safe areas prior to the commencement of the new school term there is absolutely no truth in the reports of internally displaced people living under trees
5713125 terrorists are now fleeing the areas in numbers following extensive military ground and air assaults
5713126 are fighting for the cause standing shoulder to shoulder with men
5713127 human suffering agitates all no matter which religion ethnicity or language those who suffer belong to
5713128 everyone needs to do their part to alleviate this pain
5713129 we assure you that we will do our best to be the voice of africa along with african nations on the security council
5713130 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5713131 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5713132 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5713133 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5713134 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place
5713135 ya que no se conoce si lo que publican los medios de comunicaci n es su opini n y su intenci n o a lo mejor son manipulaciones interesadas

5713142 the commission sought to eliminate the creation of loopholes through which whole fleets of vessels could sail whilst ensuring that it did nothing to impair its own future freedom of action with regard to enforcing competition law
5713143 before the games started i was really anti olympics but now theyve started im really getting into the olympic spirit
5713144 instead of a medals table a few of my friends and i have been keeping an olympics hottie table we post the hottest athletes of the day and perv over their photos
5713145 we like the fact that he could probably do 10 events in our front room and not get tired
5713146 but were intrigued by basketball superstar yao ming i mean just imagine seeing that much person naked its intriguing they used to have cardboard cut outs of him mcdonalds in beijing and i only came up to his nipple level
5713147 im not really into the athletes i prefer older men i like the coaches
5713148 but i love watching basketball its really exciting in fact i am great at basket ball myself
5713149 i love phelps when he is swimming he looks like a shark i like it whens he in the water all wavy
5713150 but generally i prefer the american gymnasts because they are powerful theyre beautiful and they have incredible bodies
5713151 i havent really been noticing the men in the olympics although i do like watching the volleyball
5713152 but rather of possessing articles intending they should be used in some way at some future time of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism the precise details of which such as time and place had yet to be finalized
5713153 is amongst the largest and most extensive ever discovered and thus makes this case one of the most serious of its type to come before the courts
5713154 hopefully the left will challenge this anything that keeps mccains heroism front and center without a shred of evidence from any eyewitness that hes lying is tantamount to an in kind campaign contribution more please ill make you follow the link for swindles assessment of the naysayers hes right too about the guards and their associates occasionally showing compassion bob owens googled around to see if he could corroborate mccains story and stumbled upon a similar incident involving former pow and gop senator jeremiah denton the dumbest part of all of this aside from the fact that the nutroots is pushing it into the mainstream media where itll redound to mccains advantage and dirty st baracks hands by association is that if he was going to make up stories to prove his devotion while in prison surely he could do better than this i remember some lefty at tnr i think noting quite rightly after mccains christmas ad came out that the specifics of it really are more a testament to his captors faith and humanity than to mccains if maverick wanted to dazzle believers with evidence of his own grace under pressure hes got material to work with but then this is a guy whose son was stationed in iraq and yet who almost never mentions that fact on the trail even though it gives him moral cover in his push for a sustained troop presence anyway rock on nutroots
5713155 john mccain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that i find personally really surprising and frankly upsetting
5713156 this is a different john mccain this is not the senator john mccain this is want to be president john mccain
5713157 and the result is that john mccain has flip flopped on more issues than i was even ever accused possibly of thinking about
5713158 if you like what has happened to oil prices john mccain is going to continue that policy if you like what you see about health care john mccain has no health care plan
5713159 i would have at least expected the john mccain that i knew back then to realize what almost every person in the pentagon has admitted
5713160 that says theres no violent history between sunni and shia thats wrong his judgment that says this is going to increase the stability of the middle east it hasnt its made it less stable the judgment that says quote this will be the best thing for america and the world in a long time its the worst thing that weve done in a long time and hes turned his focus away from afghanistan and al qaeda and made america less safe thats dangerous for our country
5713161 as we prepare to face off with whomever the democrats select as their nominee that we all follow johns lead and run a respectful campaign focused on the issues throughout the primary election we saw john mccain reject the type of politics that degrade our civics and this will not change
5713162 as you do to the least of my brethren you do unto me

5713166 when an elected prime minister is ousted he is subjected to execution prison or exile but when a dictator leaves he is presented the guard of honour
5713167 by undoing musharrafs unlawful acts and holding him to account for his crimes the pakistani government will advance human rights and national security in the country

5713181 as a discount broker schw makes money on every transaction it does for its clients
5713182 for schwab it doesnt matter whether the market goes up or down its just matters that the market keeps on chugging along
5713183 investing in schwab is like betting with the casino and not the gambler and those kinds of odds ill take any day fact is all that matters is that stock and options traders keep plying their trade
5713184 and well they have increased trading activity helped schwab post better results for the last quarter and that trading surge has continued into july with average daily trades to date already 7 9 higher than in june
5713185 moreover the growth in the individual investing sector is huge you see companies are increasingly putting the responsibility for retirement planning back on their employees
5713186 so as baby boomers retire en masse and incrasingly get more involved in the management of their own investment accounts they have to find someplace to turn for sound investment advice
5713187 their market share has grown by leaps and bounds today schwab is the largest discount broker in the united states and is the no 1 provider of online trading services that dominance should continue well into the future
5713188 of course the big players in this field are combination brokerage houses and investment banks
5713189 most often when volatility in the markets goes up so does trading volume this record sized volatility right now is driving almost record setting levels of trading in options and derivatives in particular one reason the company is so strong is that its business is well diversified
5713190 in addition to its trading dominance schwab was also a pioneer in the area of no transaction fee mutual funds making the company one of the three largest u s managers of mutual funds alongside fidelity and vanguard
5713191 and while the second quarter results were lauded its the companys underlying performance that really deserves attention schwabs exceptional second quarter report demonstrates that the company remains successful at attracting new accounts and assets this is a key factor
5713192 during the three months that ended june 30 schwab added 226 000 new client accounts and 26 billion in new assets boosting its total client assets to 1 4 trillion this is almost a perfect storm in which the market is actually driving stock and option trading
5713193 and heres what makes the outlook even better the company just announced that its increasing its quarterly dividend by 6 cents a share an astounding jump of 20
5713194 no doubt a dividend increase of this size indicates the companys bullish outlook for the future increases are hardly ever made unless management is certain the new payout can be maintained and 20 is a substantial increase
5713195 and then theres the 32 return on equity for schwab its likely one of the most enviable roes in the business the firm weathered the market storm fantastically and now its diversification into asset management and advisory services is paying off
5713196 with its industry leading reputation and brand schwab is well positioned to keep raking in profits from traders ook for strong earnings growth to propel the stock price to new levels

5713228 sasisekharans team has changed our view of flu viruses and how they must adapt to infect us
5713229 the work may also improve our ability to monitor the evolution of the h5n1 virus and thwart potential outbreaks
5713230 this new work shows that there are sublevels of sugar that the virus prefers to use to get into cells and the authors suggest this is a significant factor in why h5n1 has not yet spread to humans
5713231 whatever the underlying determinants if we continue to experience widespread uncontrolled outbreaks of h5n1 in poultry the appearance of strains well adapted to human beings might just be matter of time
5713232 the virus isolated had no changes to indicate adaptation to human infection

5713270 farming now means nothing to us because even if we work hard in the fields it is not helping when you sell your produce the money you get is useless and the cheques take time to clear this is our second week here we are waiting for the money from the bank
5713271 it is better for them to bring the markets to us so that we dont waste money travelling to harare where we end up stranded like this the money we are being paid is very little and accessing it is difficult too
5713272 we are wasting a lot of money on food and transport costs travelling to harare had the market been in the rural areas or if the buyers came to buy in the rural areas it would be better now we cant pay school fees or buy food for our families because all the money goes towards travel costs
5713273 from the growers perspective anything that eases the transport problems is a plus but we have to be careful with how we do it because it also affects the prices that will be paid for the produce

5713303 was the extent to which he needed to choose someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum lack of experience particularly in foreign policy versus a candidate who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5713304 mr biden the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee clearly fell into the category of helping mr obama on foreign policy while mr kaine is a relative newcomer to national politics and would reinforce the notion of change both mr kaine and mr bayh would help mr obama in a state that democrats are trying to put in play
5713305 in a twist that goes against recent history there are signs that obama may wait to announce his choice until this weekend or just before in hopes of providing a big boost before the convention opens monday in denver
5713306 obama is said to be operating with a list of five finalists though there is no solid confirmation from his inner circle of who and how many are serious contenders
5713307 prepping for the job with a weekend trip overseas to georgia at the invitation of president mikheil saakashvili to assess the situation there his stock among those not in the know has risen sharply lately because of world events how he is faring with the candidate is not known
5713308 a current senator and the former governor of indiana one of the red states on obamas expand the map target list bayh is considered a default safe choice and a candidate who in contrast to biden is closer generationally to a candidate who has called for turning the page on the politics of the past but he generates some hostility among progressives and antiwar democrats because of his centrist positions on domestic policy and his original support for the iraq war
5713309 the governor of virginia and the first governor to endorse obama appears to be a finalist it has already been reported that the obama campaign will be holding a big event in richmond this week fueling speculation that kaine is very very high on the list it has also been reported that the choice of former virginia governor mark warner as convention keynoter has diminished kaines chances
5713310 by one calculus delawares sen joe biden who made a quick trip overseas for a first hand assessment of the confrontation between georgia and russia may have become the front runner but obama is scheduled to be in virginia this thursday giving him a perfect moment in the days before the democratic national convention to anoint virginia gov tim kaine as his running mate
5713311 the indiana senator would help obama win the hoosier state which obama desperately wants to win
5713312 working against bayh however is a soft spoken some say bland manner that makes some tacticians wonder whether bayh would be able to fit the running mate role of an attack dog against sen john mccain
5713313 senator hillary clinton is by far the favorite choice for the number two spot on the democratic ticket according to a cbs news new york times poll 28 percent volunteer her as their top choice
5713314 3 he was a big clinton supporter so it would be a fence mending move
5713315 4 indiana is in play and its a big prize 13 electoral votes if obama bayh could steal indiana its very hard to see mccain winning and bayh is very popular there
5713316 5 he has experience and yet is still young enough to fit into the new generation mold
5713317 6 they like him in broderland would play pretty well with the pundits
5713318 but two or three others would be just fine and people obsess over this way too much
5713319 why do we have such a hard time hearing good news from baghdad
5713320 russias objections to the sites have never been based on anything more than trying to define a sphere of influence in europe and on the territory of existing nato members
5713321 senator mccain believes that is unacceptable especially in the aftermath of russias brutal invasion of georgia
5713322 congress will not and should not fund a system until testing has proven that it works and that testing will not be completed until 2010 at the earliest
5713323 russias actions represent compelling data that should be convincing to democrats that we dont want to delay this thing
5713324 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone
5713325 what you have is an attempt to conflate the third site issue with russias provocation in the caucasus and theyre completely unrelated
5713326 russias primary concern was that we were exaggerating the iranian threat and therefore these sites in europe must be directed at them and weve gone a long way to try to dissuade them of that notion
5713327 this historic russian fear of encirclement is very much alive at the moment
5713328 today its much more probable than a few weeks ago that the american side will take into consideration the proposition of my government
5713329 it is with profound regret that i tender my resignation as sheriff effective immediately
5713330 ive never had a cell phone go dead from the number of calls
5713331 the ball is in the governors court and she still has an opportunity to pick up that ball and do what she chooses to do with it
5713332 it is probably as offensive if not more so for the majority of detroiters to wait that long
5713333 i dont think theres any question as to the governors authority
5713334 the governor is perceived as politically independent while the council has political rivals of the mayor
5713335 we think that its problematic for the governor to sit as judge jury and executioner
5713336 were taking kind of a wait and see approach with the governor
5713337 the governor has the authority to do it i dont question that
5713338 my point is that she should exercise her discretion against deciding to remove the mayor because this would overrule the right of the people of detroit to make their choice as to who will be their mayor
5713339 this issue is not just detroit the issue is the state of michigan
5713340 i am sorry for the hurt and pain that my actions caused

5713344 theres little education about breast health among the 18 to 34 year old demographic and that happens to be the same group that we are trying to attract with the line so it was a perfect partnership
5713345 my phone will work without electrical power with a broken router or by just plugging my analogue telephone onto the wall socket
5713346 when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like minneapolis we dont need 6 000
5713347 i never had any complaints from my colleagues about my slovenliness or unpleasant odors coming from my direction
5713348 this is a test this is just a test of the emergency broadcast system
5713349 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5713350 when these people came back and were telling these horrific stories and our superiors were egging people on some people were actually volunteering to go over there and it just seemed like justified homicide it didnt seem right to me
5713351 new film focuses on us soldiers whose consciences have turned them against war
5713352 i feel that at this point i have no legal avenue for pursuing recognition of my beliefs so therefore i have no choice but to leave the military rather than do something i feel is immoral
5713353 for many it is when theyre pointing a weapon at someone and seeing the person or being confronted with taking the lives of very innocent people
5713354 a chance to make something out of myself a chance to really succeed in life and have an honorable profession to help those in need
5713355 this was my first introduction to the theory and practice of non violence
5713356 i heard over the radio set an iranian voice saying coalition aircraft maintain five nautical miles and as we kept making passes over this submarine the voice got more and more nervous
5713357 this man human being in the submarine iranian or not was just a human being like me whos my brother
5713358 i had nowhere to live i had no money i dont have a car i dont have a drivers license so really the only possibility i had for having a place to live and a means to get by would be to join the military
5713359 that was a huge turning point in my life because it really made me think i am not guaranteed another day i thought that if i did die right now i would have to stand before god and it wouldnt be good enough for me to say well hey i had fun i got drunk i went to the strip club
5713360 due to tennessees oppressive election access laws ms mckinney will be listed on the ballot as an independent candidate which we can achieve with 275 valid signatures

5713364 safety should be a given we shouldnt be building roads that arent safe and i know my opponent gov chris gregoire wants to talk about safety safety safety well she should be doing that already why would we have a road that we dont consider safe
5713365 if sr 17 is also that dangerous as well were going to have to address it
5713366 when the farmers take as long to get from their farm to issaquah and from issaquah to the port its everybodys problem
5713367 its the cost of business when you have your goods your services trying to move around the region and youre paying people to sit there in traffic and trying to get to the port and get out quite frankly its everybodys problem
5713368 and i dont know how you get those containers out of the port on the back of a bicycle
5713369 so the way i look at it is that once ive got that tunnel done i take down the viaduct ive got the most expensive strip of land in the state of washington
5713370 what ive said is lets not sell the land but well lease the land long term leases
5713371 she spent a billion dollars propping up a viaduct in seattle so she could tear it down in two years a billion dollars so she could tear it down in two years
5713372 put that into comparison with something she does over here gives you a million dollars for a park or something like that
5713373 you just have to sit down and go line by line through the budget making thousands of decisions and you make rational decisions just like i would do in my own business

5713377 the idea that apple can choose what functionality my applications should have frightens me
5713378 how about legislation that requires a mandatory kill switch be integrated into every human being so that the police can kill an individual without even needing to dispatch an officer to a scene
5713379 you know if you were a guy id tell you youd have big khahunas

5713382 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
5713383 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
5713384 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5713385 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5713386 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5713387 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5713388 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5713389 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5713390 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5713391 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5713392 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
5713393 sticks and stones may brake my bones but words can never hurt me
5713394 why is it that if an arab does not like something does not approve of something is not happy with how something turned out is astonished by someones success they automatically blame it on western or zionist influence why why cant arabs blame them selves sometimes for their stupidity
5713395 why is it that if an arab does not like something does not approve of something is not

5713405 we saw this tower as a huge positive in the long run
5713406 on the short run it would have been harder because there were a lot of people opposed to it
5713407 a modest increase in the minimum wage would improve the well being of low wage workers and would not have the adverse effects that critics have claimed
5713408 after a gruelling recording mixing and mastering process during the early summer dead harvest was finished however we are not entirely satisfied with the final mix and we believe it doesnt do the album justice rather than release something we are not 100 behind we have chosen to take a break and go back to re mix and re master the album the most important thing is to put out a killer album we apologize to our fans who have been waiting for dead harvest all this time all we can say is that its worth the wait currently the release has been pushed to somewhere around february 2009
5713409 well be looking at the potential for a hospital over the next two or three years
5713410 the river district lawsuit has complicated things quite a bit
5713411 if this building werent around it would have remained a shell and these people wouldnt have a place to live

5713413 i have never experienced a storm where the lightning flash and thunder were simultaneous
5713414 we had four strikes very close by within about five or six minutes i thought that one of them got our tower crane because its power was out
5713415 they were here in less than 20 minutes and started to inspect the crane
5713416 usually when a crane is struck the electric panel gets taken out but this one showed no sign of damage
5713417 also there should be an arc mark where the crane was hit and i couldnt find any
5713418 over 70 people were inside the mine at the time of the accident all the rest have been moved out to the surface
5713419 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response

5713424 moms conventional wisdom of eating fruits and vegetables to lead a healthy life has evolved into more scientific fact finding research during the last four decades due to advances in science
5713425 studies are showing the importance of fruits vegetables and nuts in reducing the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases
5713426 it is befitting that the society is focusing more on health and preventing diseases
5713427 while we continue to consume various healthy foods several challenges of toxicity bioavailability of certain bioactive compounds and food drug interactions are yet to be understood
5713428 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5713429 about 25 percent of my patients have ragweed allergy and i make sure they are well prepared for peak pollen season
5713430 since allergic rhinitis also known as hay fever can quickly develop into other complications such as ear infections sinusitis recurrent sore throats cough and headache its important that ragweed allergy is treated and well controlled studies show it also can cause altered sleep patterns fatigue irritability and poor school performance accurate allergy diagnosis and proper treatment can eliminate or alleviate most of these problems
5713431 you can double quit rates with a telephone quitline and a free patch

5713436 in phase 2 clinical trials telaprevir based regimens have demonstrated the potential to increase sustained viral response rates across a broad spectrum of patients infected with the hepatitis c virus including patients who failed to achieve svr with previous pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy many of whom are at high risk for life threatening hcv related complications
5713437 the realize trial of telaprevir is a landmark phase 3 trial of an investigational hcv protease inhibitor in null responder and other patients who failed prior treatment and will seek to generate additional data to demonstrate the benefit of telaprevir in this difficult to treat patient population
5713438 approximately 6 million patients are chronically infected with hepatitis c in the u s and e u today and approximately 650 000 of these patients have failed previous treatments of pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy and are in need of a new therapeutic option to treat their disease
5713439 data generated from this phase 3 trial in treatment failure patients as well as data from the ongoing phase 3 advance trial in treatment naive patients may further contribute to the emerging profile of telaprevir to address the significant medical need in both treatment naive and treatment failure patients
5713440 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein
5713441 this mutation occurs at a crucial location where the protein typically binds with a molecule called atp that provides the energy the protein needs to move copper from place to place
5713442 past studies have compared the behavior of the mutant protein with that of the nonmutant and found very little difference so it was unclear how this small change led to the devastating effects that are seen in wilson disease
5713443 this implies that the loop has some importance perhaps in regulation of atp7bs activities and we intend to follow up on this in our future studies
5713444 the market is oversupplied by at least 1 million barrels a day if opec would like to remove this additional oil out of the market then opec has to cut some production
5713445 catalysis is particularly important when it comes to energy supply
5713446 mike was very aware of and concerned about the big energy problem and the role of catalysis in the solution
5713447 this symposium is our way of honoring mike and the impact he had on our personal and professional lives
5713448 we are working to find cheaper ways to make these processes happen
5713449 in order to maximize catalyst performance we have to understand how the process works
5713450 for example there are a very large number of applications involving catalysis that utilize alumina as the catalyst support material

5713455 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5713456 no es hora de homenajes sino de afrontar nueva etapa
5713457 el m ximo respeto a todo lo conseguido ya no es hora de homenajes y s de comenzar una nueva etapa
5713458 es normal que est un poco acelerado es un s ntoma de que se tiene emoci n por empezar y eso es importante en cualquier ejercicio de la vida
5713459 he vivido situaciones dif ciles y de gran responsabilidad y en una selecci n puede que se acreciente pero es parecido no hay mayor responsabilidad en un club que una selecci n
5713460 es lo mejor para m y para el f tbol espa ol partimos de una base y lo que hace falta es que sepamos cuidar todo lo que se ha conseguido y si es posible potenciarlo
5713461 mirar para atr s era una obligaci n m a en el plano humano y profesional
5713462 en el plano humano les hice ver la uni n y la humildad que hab an tenido en la eurocopa quer amos que eso siguiera porque el futbolista debe ser humilde y que el t tulo de la eurocopa no le cambie
5713463 en el plano futbol stico tambi n hay que mirar para atr s para atr s porque lo conseguido es importante el camino est marcado por eso en lo sustancial la convocatoria para este partido difiere muy poco de la que fue campe n de europa
5713464 es mi idea individualizar las charlas y ayer lo hice con los centrocampistas y les dije que tambi n son hombres b sicos para el futuro como lo han sido hasta ahora
5713465 me lo imagino como una vuelta a la normalidad y a la actividad y que el pasado no nos llegue a confundir
5713466 se puede ir cambiando luego en funci n del rival y de los partidos pero una idea base ya la tenemos
5713467 desde el m ximo reconocimiento a todo lo que se ha hecho en el pasado no estamos para homenajes sino para afrontar una nueva etapa y una nueva competici n estoy un poco alterado y es producto de la emoci n que me produce poder volver al trabajo porque no soy una persona muy fr a y s un apasionado al f tbol

5713469 britains border security is now amongst the toughest in the world
5713470 the new facial recognition gates undertake checks against security watch lists in the same way as a current manual controls
5713471 the trial will tell us whether these gates can maintain the high level of entry security we have introduced into the uk
5713472 our high tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
5713473 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
5713474 the british public rightly expects our borders to protect the national interests tackling immigration crime smuggling and tax fraud
5713475 first he did it and people were trying to stop him because he was getting bad cuts
5713476 he pressured him to make him do the knives he held him and tried to get his tee shirt off pushing him and pulling him
5713477 were very keen to reassure the community and to encourage them to work with us and the police theres a huge level of shock and concern
5713478 there has been a lot of work with youngsters in harpurhey and it is crucial there is more of that work with children teenagers parents and community workers
5713479 possession and use or knives wont be tolerated by the police
5713480 the only people who should be asked are those who live within it
5713481 who did the survey did they ask drivers or was it as i suspect a survey of public transport passengers who of course would want their busses to get through quicker
5713482 in my experience people who are victim to sexual abuse as a child rarely get over it it can mean flash backs and memories triggered by something as simple as a smell
5713483 it impacts on people throughout their adult lives and can cause problems with relationships it can also cause difficulties in holding down a job because it can result in people having a mistrust of those in authority
5713484 the judge indicated that there was an overwhelming likelihood green will face an immediate and significant sentence of imprisonment when he is sentenced next month this can only be right and proper given the dreadful abuse he subjected a succession of young boys to
5713485 i would however urge them to either contact the police or speak to me in confidence in order to bring closure to their ordeal
5713486 we have co operated with the authorities since the beginning of the investigation
5713487 it is regrettable when something like this happens our priority and concern is always for the victims
5713488 truly i say to you it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven 24 again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
5713489 with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible
5713490 lo we have left everything and followed you what then shall we have
5713491 truly i say to you in the new world when the son of man shall sit on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel
5713492 were very pleased to have the vote to move forward on the repairs that need to get done
5713493 a representative of the boughton park commission will report to the town on a quarterly basis those briefings will help
5713494 we do want to sit back down and look at the intermunicipal agreement on the advice of our attorneys it hasnt been looked at in years is this structured in a way that can be beneficial to the future of boughton park
5713495 leider gibt hier einer der ganz gro en verlage klein bei das verhei t nichts gutes
5713496 we actually know very little about possums their needs requirements numbers how they use our shared space and why
5713497 its very difficult to gain information on the ecology of animals that live in suburbia you cant track them through peoples back yards so in order to find out more we need the involvement of the community
5713498 were looking into the distribution of possums how people manage possums and were looking into peoples opinions of possums
5713499 we want people to do the survey even if they havent seen a possum
5713500 what are you thinking whatll you hit how far do you hit that club
5713501 i am proud that in dane county we have the number of interested and involved citizens who will spend their valuable time to see first hand what the men and women of the sheriffs office do for our citizens and how each of them in partnership with the sheriffs office can play an active role in keeping our communities and neighborhoods safe
5713502 the rah bed capacity is at crisis and impacting on the ability to maintain safe and efficient patient care
5713503 expedite patient discharges cancel non urgent messages and prioritise transfers
5713504 the hospital did call a code white on august 11 2008 as it became very busy
5713505 reassure people that at all times the safety of patients is the most important consideration
5713506 these situations arise very rarely at the rah but our demand management procedures are in place to ensure that staff are aware that patients who are ready to go home should be discharged in a timely manner in order to free up beds for patients awaiting admission
5713507 the hospital quickly returned to normal operation with staff managing the demand that day and ensuring all patients were treated appropriately
5713508 i want to reassure the community that the hospital is functioning well despite the higher winter demand and that at all times patient safety is our priority
5713509 currently all public hospital intensive care units for example are full to point of overflowing
5713510 the rah is hoping for a quiet night tonight because if they have a busy night then they wont be able to cope tomorrow and will have to start cancelling elective surgeries
5713511 weve called for an increase of 10 per cent in hospital bed numbers for south australia and even the proposed new marjorie jackson nelson hospital is not going to achieve that
5713512 most people are aware our hospitals are busy over winter

5713527 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range we had the opportunity to see mr fishburne in thurgood on broadway a few weeks ago and it was a truly profound experience the actor disappeared and thurgood marshall was standing there on the stage mr fishburne is also a talented writer and director if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaboration and we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream

5713534 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5713535 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5713536 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5713537 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5713538 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5713539 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5713540 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5713541 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5713542 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5713543 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it

5713545 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5713546 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5713547 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5713548 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president

5713900 though commodity prices have come down significantly from record highs in mid july and the dollar has strengthened consumers can still expect to see increased inflation for some time to come as the producer price pressures feed through to consumer prices
5713901 the continued weakening of the housing market is an additional pressure and households will feel further squeezed in terms of real disposable income
5713902 given this state of affairs and the general weakness of the economy

5713918 as anyone reading newspaper headlines knows the effects of the ongoing housing downturn and turmoil in financial markets continue to be a drag on economic growth
5713919 its a lot easier to avoid making new spending commitments than it is to cut spending after the fact
5713920 we can easily over commit in the budget and build expectations we cannot meet if we fail to estimate revenues conservatively
5713921 in large urban areas the culture of public education is broken if you dont fix this culture then you are not going to be able to make the kind of changes that are needed

5713924 so the students will be able to judge whether or not the debate is one sided however we have to wait for the debate date to be fixed first

5713935 me cans de dar golpes pero no me marcaban no importaba lo que hiciese en el cuadril tero
5713936 todo lo contrario para l que no me tocaba y le sub an puntos sin ning n tipo de justificaci n

5713939 ahora hay que seguir y sacar las cosas positivas que me dej mi primera participaci n en unos juegos ol mpicos
5713940 todo el mundo lo ha visto nuestro boxeador ha dominado la pelea lo ha hecho mucho mejor tanto en el apartado t cnico como en el intercambio de golpes pero no habido manera de que los jueces tuviesen el mismo criterio

5713942 ha sido descarado se ha visto c mo ha salido de castigado el p gil ruso y en la puntuaci n le han dado como si fuese a la inversa
5713943 no es justo que sucedan est s cosas pero es lo que hay con los jueces

5713957 on this issue mccain couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
5713958 forget about winning our nine electoral votes next november we dont vote for water rustlers in this state we tar and feather them
5713959 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
5713960 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5713961 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
5713962 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu

5713986 this was picked up during a panel discussion with matric pupils last week thursday his silly answers were a cause of concern
5713987 he has never given any trouble since he started grade eight in the school we were just worried about him not having a vision we were not aware of the underlying problem
5713988 i have been quite pleased with the quality of our training sessions and i think the team is working very hard
5713989 the freshmen have adapted better than i expected and the veterans are showing more maturity in their game outside of the obvious technical improvement the spirit of the team is as strong as i have ever seen it they have been a pleasure to coach so far and as long as they continue to give each other their very best every day on the field in the classroom and as part of the lafayette community i will be proud of them

5714006 none of us are not about investing in future services but we believe we have a very good model of primary care and we believe the polyclinic model will actively try to undermine the current practice
5714007 we have enough practices in north yorkshire every patient can find a good gp and we have the highest satisfactory levels in the country and to try and duplicate and cherry pick patients from practices will destabilise and undermine them

5714023 we had order we didnt have hundreds and hundreds of kids down there unsupervised
5714024 they need to be parents they need to supervise their children and not drop them off downtown unsupervised

5714040 for some reason the whole concept is just not doing very well
5714041 youd see micro spacecraft mainly in communications instead of companies sharing a large satellite you could have even small companies getting their own micro spacecraft
5714042 for the military undetectability is also important either for surveillance applications or when it comes to zapping other satellites
5714043 and when it comes to a spacecraft less than 5 kilograms 10 pounds you cant really detect it unless its within a quarter of a mile of you larger spacecraft can be detected from farther and consequently blasted out of the sky
5714044 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5714045 thermal control was really the big barrier to developing miniature spacecraft
5714046 this should allow much more rapid development of micro and nano spacecraft
5714047 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5714048 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft

5714054 contrary to inflammatory headlines generated by the release of kpmgs medical schemes anti fraud survey when placed in context the statistics actually show that fraudulent claims perpetrated by pharmacies are infinitesimal and that they have decreased
5714055 rather than an epidemic of fraud what the report actually shows is that there is a small problem with fraudulent claims to medical schemes which can and must be addressed by service providers and others
5714056 the conclusion that gps and pharmacies are the largest perpetrators of fraud may well be true but it is coming off a very small base

5714060 this shows that there is no excuse for failing the poorest students
5714061 in areas like london where national government has invested in improving education for the poorest they have succeeded in other areas the gcse attainment of the poorest students remains alarmingly low
5714062 this is further proof of the difference that investment makes to a disadvantaged childs education
5714063 it is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents the government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children no matter their background have equal chances to achieve a decent education

5714084 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5714085 yesterday 10 of our soldiers were killed in afghanistan 21 others were wounded during a joint reconnaissance mission with the afghan national army
5714086 the initial patrol was reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams during the engagement a large number of insurgents were killed

5714089 the simple fact is that non violent means do not work against evil gandhis non violent resistance against the british occupiers had some effect because britain was wrong but not evil the same is true of the success of non violent civil rights resistance against de jure racism most people including those in power knew that what was being done was wrong but evil is an entirely different beast gandhi would have gone to the ovens had he attempted non violent resistance against the nazis when one encounters evil the only solution is violence actual or threatened thats all evil understands
5714090 when one encounters evil the only solution is violence actual or threatened

5714110 henrik larsson is still a great player he is probably the best player in the swedish league he is a very strong player
5714111 we all expect a very good match an open game but of course france are a world class nation we are strong at home i think it will be a very tight game
5714112 as he henry is here and pat patrick viera injured isnt thierry has all the qualities and skills to be captain but in the future that remains to be seen
5714113 vista isnt that bad you havent tried it it isnt as bad as everyone says you never gave it a chance omg

5714117 it is becoming increasingly obvious that for government to succeed to realize its vision 2030 public private partnership needs to be encouraged in all sectors of the economy and services to namibians ium is one such initiative that has found its niche in the market focusing on management sciences in different areas
5714118 ium caters for namibians especially those from previously disadvantaged backgrounds and provides skills and knowledge that enable them to improve their lot and to play a meaningful role in developing the country since its inception the institution has graduated over 1 000 students most of whom are making an input both in the private and public sectors
5714119 the confidence in ium has continued to grow over the years as it is becoming more and more evident that it has a role to play in the provision of education and skills today marks a historic moment for the institution and the commencement of a much needed and planned for new campus construction of a campus that will increase student numbers enhance the quality of service delivery and provide an infrastructure in line with international standards
5714120 we appreciate that a project if this magnitude is a costly undertaking for any institution public or private it is in this light that i wish to appeal to financiers and well wishers to support the initiative to ensure its success as a registered organization not for gain people need to support it the success of any namibian project is the success of every namibian

5714138 we want them all to compete as if theyll be starters
5714139 well have a rotation so that all of our quarterbacks have an opportunity to work early
5714140 thats something that we want to do to give every guy an opportunity to compete for the starting job
5714141 i think theres no right or wrong way to do it if it were an exact science then everybody would follow the same protocol as a competitor and a player i think that you want to be out on the field and you want to have the ball in your hands
5714142 you put pressure on all the players and see how theyre going to respond to pressure
5714143 there is pressure in this league every day and we need to see how guys handle pressure
5714144 when theyre faced with pressure we have to make sure they dont get stressed out thats the thing thats important we have to put them in those situations manufacture them not only in practice but in games
5714145 you have to go into it saying you have to have two guys that are ready to play you want to have your no 2 guy ready to go
5714146 if you look back i dont think there were many times teams had to go to no 3 quarterback during a game
5714147 my emotions let my study habits with the playbook leave i stayed in shape but i didnt study my playbook
5714148 there is a negotiating season a pay season and a play season
5714149 it is play season and joe is a football player he is out there to compete and win a position on this football team
5714150 after 12 years in this league i know getting acclimated with your quarterback and getting your timing is necessary
5714151 i didnt come to the offseason program i didnt come to otas and i understand theres a thing called order you have to come in as the eighth receiver i understand that ive got to work my way back up if im here
5714152 i am here right now and when wide receivers coach terry robiskie and offensive coordinator mike mularkey feel its time for me to come up in the offense and start getting reps and making plays ill do that
5714153 its never going to be a locker room issue i respect all my coaches i respect coach smith and everybody else im going to come out here and be a professional if they ask me to go im going to go until i hear otherwise been doing working my behind off and catching balls
5714154 there are a lot of young players that i think are going to have a really fun time in jacksonville having their first professional action
5714155 we are excited to get out there and see how we play together when its a live game
5714156 this is the first action that laurent has had in quite some time well have to wait and see how he responds to running around
5714157 i was told that i was going to get in
5714158 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
5714159 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
5714160 we wanted to get him in early to play against the best and i thought he handled it extremely well
5714161 its funny jack said hey i love you man for not trying that field goal theres no need in the preseason to plan for overtime
5714162 i thought mike playing for the win was smart for both teams
5714163 i still have a long way to go and im glad that one is under my belt
5714164 we sacked the quarterback a few times which was good to see
5714165 i talked to coach smith about that before and thats exciting to go get out there right away
5714166 were going to have a good week of preparation and hopefully play well friday night
5714167 we want to give everybody an opportunity to work with the first unit and thats still the plan
5714168 the biggest thing is you have to stay composed and when things break down guys move faster in the nfl than they did in college
5714169 you have to make smart decisions toward the end of the play the biggest thing is you have to stay relaxed and go out there and be composed
5714170 we were fortunate to get ryan into a situation this past week where he got a two minute situation
5714171 barring the interception at the end he took them off the 5 yard line and went 11 plays he was very effective moving the team we had a throw wed like to have back hed like to have back but again its a learning curve for matt
5714172 we would like for matt to get into those situations we need to get him some red zone work and hopefully well be able to do that the more we can expose our guys to the better were going go be as a football team
5714173 i really was impressed with the way he handled the two minute situation before the half last saturday night
5714174 he did throw the interception but he moved well in the pocket

5714187 most parents mistakenly assume they can install their infant car seat correctly without first getting help however due to differences in car seat models and the vehicles in which they reside its no easy task
5714188 this program equips parents with the knowledge necessary to keep kids safe from day one
5714189 despite parents best intentions the vast majority of inspections we do turn up safety concerns this is largely due to the fact that instruction manuals are not specific to unique vehicle and seat combinations we provide information that is tailored to your car seat and vehicle providing parents with the knowledge necessary to install the seat properly every time and peace of mind knowing that their child is safe
5714190 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
5714191 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
5714192 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
5714193 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
5714194 our results indicate that needle free nasal immunization using a combination of nanoemulsion and hepatitis b antigen could be a safe and effective hepatitis b vaccine and also provide an alternative booster method for existing vaccines
5714195 our studies however indicate no inflammation and no evidence of the vaccine in the olfactory bulb
5714196 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
5714197 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
5714198 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run

5714222 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5714223 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5714224 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5714225 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold

5714238 the unlicensed spectrum is overcrowded with a large number of wireless devices
5714239 to achieve the best performance of wireless networks in this setting it is necessary to make the wireless networks spectrum aware they should operate in the cleanest frequency spectrum
5714240 furthermore the network should operate on as much of the spectrum that is available hence they should not only adapt the channel number centre frequency but also the channel width

5714286 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
5714287 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower
5714288 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
5714289 there was no attack on the airport in tbilisi it was a factory that produces combat airplanes
5714290 every bomb that falls over our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
5714291 we have their phone numbers but we havent been able to reach them these are people we know and we are all hoping for their success
5714292 the military bases where we trained the soldiers are practically gone the russians have been bombing them over the past few days
5714293 the bases where we trained the forces were not in the areas of conflict but its not a huge country and the russians are bombing bases in central georgia and in the area of the capital tbilisi
5714294 it looked interesting relative to israel the money was excellent too
5714295 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out we received basic background about tensions between georgia and russia but most of what i learned came from talking to the soldiers from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
5714296 israel ziv and gal hirsch would come from time to time and watch us in action but we managed day to day operations ourselves
5714297 its not the standard we know in israel but when we left them they were at a good level they took the training very seriously there is a wider age range than in israel from 18 to 35 but they function very well over the past few days ive been following the news and i think they grasped a little of how to use strategy like we taught them it looks like we did a good job
5714298 we taught them counterterror and house to house fighting but that was very basic
5714299 i dont think the georgians would start fighting as long as the israeli forces where there
5714300 once when tension was high after russia shot down a drone we were evacuated to tbilisi
5714301 we were at some of the soldiers homes for dinner theyre very emotional and warm and tried to compare the situation in israel to their situation they were very excited that we had come to help them
5714302 when we found ourselves in a similar situation we expected the world to act differently
5714303 as soon as a durable peace takes hold we need to move forward with dialogue and peaceful negotiations
5714304 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
5714305 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
5714306 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
5714307 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
5714308 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
5714309 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
5714310 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
5714311 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
5714312 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
5714313 we are now in a fight against the great russia
5714314 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
5714315 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business
5714316 legal and constitutional protection for the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others
5714317 we know what were up against right wing organizations that will stop at nothing to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry they want to target same sex couples to be treated differently under the california constitution a document that was created to ensure our equality
5714318 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5714319 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5714320 the problem is that its an imperfect system with a lot of glitches we know that the government is moving quickly toward this system but people who are authorized to work may be designated as unauthorized through faulty information
5714321 it really doesnt take any training and it usually takes less than three minutes to get verification you put in the information one way if theyre a citizen with a social security number and card and other way if they have a green card
5714322 it was just a pilot program until a few years ago
5714323 his years as a troubadour gave him so much time working with people
5714324 people tell him he should be in the democratic party
5714325 but he says the place you have to change hearts is in the republican party
5714326 he sees it as his mission if he had 1 for every person in the mccain camp who agrees with him hed be set financially for a year but some people throw rocks at him
5714327 women are delaying their childbearing until they complete their educations
5714328 this is the first time weve looked at a lot of these characteristics
5714329 because these youth are extremely vulnerable to exploitation by adult criminals
5714330 codifying standards for internal police matters in the city code
5714331 our obligation to comply with federal law has not changed
5714332 the ordinance requires that the police notify federal authorities if an arrestee turns out to be undocumented it also requires that city employees deny any federally funded services to illegal immigrants if required to do so under federal law
5714333 i was shocked that a person who is running for office stating that she will be the education governor would propose denying education to these kids
5714334 and i was shocked that they are going forward with this policy even though there is no federal or state law prohibiting the colleges from admitting these students
5714335 we have been waiting for pre season since the end of 2007
5714336 everyone returning knows how good we can be our defense has always been a strength and we expect that to continue with the combination of our returning players and our incoming freshmen we will be much improved in the attacking end of the field
5714337 we are going to have some fabulous competition for a number of positions on the field for players this is a bit scary however we know the competition will bring out the best in each individual
5714338 we expect to surprise people this fall there is no reason why we should not be back in the acc and ncaa tournaments we have the talent and depth now its all of our jobs to produce

5714586 our existing performance review systems were very generic and didnt focus enough on the individual

5714600 my mom scolded me when i mocked and noogied the dorkwadheads of the tri state area deep down she explained theyre all little lovewadheads just like you

5714603 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5714604 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5714605 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5714606 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5714607 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5714608 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5714609 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5714610 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5714611 new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5714612 hes talking about ongoing conversations conversations that happen this year next year 10 20 30 years down the road
5714613 as long as water is going to be an issue in the west there should be an open conversation among all parties
5714614 litigation pitting state against state over the colorado river would cost taxpayers millions and the likely result would not please anyone
5714615 thanks to the hard work of the parties involved we can now work with not against other states to resolve our water disputes
5714616 though such systems may be seen as innovative or problem solving to the institution they may repulse some users who see them as infringement on the sanctity of their peer groups or as having the potential for institutional violations of their privacy liberty ownership or creativity
5714617 i n a ceremony that received virtually no attention in the american media the united states and canada signed a military agreement feb
5714618 its kind of a trend when it comes to issues of canada u s relations and contentious issues like military integration
5714619 we see that this government is reluctant to disclose information to canadians that is readily available on american and mexican websites
5714620 this document is a unique bilateral military plan to align our respective national military plans to respond quickly to the other nations requests for military support of civil authorities
5714621 in discussing the new bilateral civil assistance plan established by usnorthcom and canada command renuart stressed
5714622 the signing of this plan is an important symbol of the already strong working relationship between canada command and u s northern command
5714623 our commands were created by our respective governments to respond to the defense and security challenges of the twenty first century
5714624 and we both realize that these and other challenges are best met through cooperation between friends
5714625 in a marathon of television and radio appearances mr mccain recited a short list of other countries said to support terrorism invariably including iraq iran and syria there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
5714626 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
5714627 the sept 11 attacks demonstrated the grave threat posed by a hostile regime possessing weapons of mass destruction and with reported ties to terrorists mr mccain wrote this was in an email to the new york times

5714645 my prediction is that we will be getting flood emergency reports from cambodia later this week
5714646 the major damages and casualties in laos from this flood are outside of vientiane laoss capital and because of the generally poor communications infrastructure in laos particularly in those villages on the river between vientiane and luang prabang where there are no roads or phone infrastructure and the fact that roads out of vientiane are blocked by high water it will take some days or longer to get a clear picture of the situation
5714647 i want to do such a bang up job with this ceremony that people will tak about it forever and ever and ever

5714651 just because facts about frogs can be reduced to facts about molecules doesnt mean there are no frogs
5714652 the scientific attitude does not merely rationalize the world explain it away but opens it up and makes its wonders available where they have been hidden from less inquiring consciousnesses
5714653 the fullest rational understanding is the understanding most filled with awe
5714654 i f the sacred narrative cannot be in the form of a religious cosmology it will be taken from the material history of the universe and the human species this trend is in no way debasing
5714655 like any author engaged in the task of building a plot the historian must grapple with the question of where to begin the story
5714656 the problem lies in the grip of the narrative itself whose rhythms and patterns were left essentially unchanged as the sacred was translated into the secular
5714657 from the perspective of neurohistory the progress of civilization is an illusion of psychotropy
5714658 when the fruits of a religion frequently include attacks on the life liberty and happiness of non believers or those who dont practice the faith the religion can be reliably classified as extremist
5714659 religion contributes to mental health by providing ultimate meaning and a source of long range guidance and goals
5714660 christians for hundreds of years were willing to put other christians to death or through merciless tortures over matters that seem incomprehensibly trivial to nonbelievers
5714661 the degree and nature of support that the extremists receive
5714662 undercurrent of public sympathy for islamic terrorists in some muslim countries
5714663 messages that readily lend themselves to extremist interpretation even if such interpretation is as moderates insist misinterpretation
5714664 the texts cited by muslim extremists can very plausibly be read to support the approach they advocate yet regarding the source of antiabortion violence its hard to put much blame on christian texts
5714665 the most extreme and dangerous religious beliefs render their adherents happy or even ecstatic
5714666 greater sexual openness equality for women religious tolerance and free speech
5714667 a notoriously difficult term to define with any kind of precision

5714669 ronnie has always led the same sort of lifestyle he always told us thats the way i am

5714672 to contribute to a more just understanding of those who have rejected religious belief
5714673 faith and reason the perpetual war ruminations of a fool
5714674 makes servility to authority the ultimate aim of human life
5714675 without the net of providence atheism and the human adventure
5714676 tenacious scientists who resist the evidence for theories they dont like long after a graceful concession would have been the appropriate response
5714677 some kind of observance was put in train and it turned out i was expected to play along put on a hat or some such
5714678 find it very hard to articulate the grounds for their anxiety
5714679 anyone who has absorbed the scientific picture of the world will conclude that there is no answer to such questions
5714680 if we go to the grand canyon and my experience of awe and terror and elevation are met only by your indifference and wish for an ice cream the rift between us is serious we are on the road to alienation and potential hostility if you see the grand canyon only as an opportunity for starting franchises and tourist camps then i would be disappointed in you we might have to split up
5714681 lets say that two people have a disagreement when one believes a proposition and the other denies i e disbelieves that proposition
5714682 often get trapped into doing far more far riskier philosophy than they need
5714683 to bring out why even someone who doesnt just disbelieve the core story of christianity but finds it literally incredible might nonetheless want to make sure we get the story right
5714684 for a gospel is neither a poets work of dramatic art nor an historians biography of jesus but the symbolization of a divine movement that went through the person of jesus into society and history
5714685 responsive pursuit of his questioning unrest to the divine source that has aroused it
5714686 an intuitive sense of the directional tension of the inquiry
5714687 capacity to seek episteme knowledge under the guidance of attraction toward the transcendent
5714688 misleading sometimes dangerous claims often leave the sincere seeker ever and again embittered
5714689 has ever bothered to check a fact in his life
5714690 dyer gets up in front of an audience and makes apodictic assertions about the nature of reality as if his pantheism were self evident needing no justification he is simply preaching a gospel as if he were jim bakker only one suspects government funded public television would probably not give bakker free airtime to do his preaching as they do wayne dyer
5714691 brothers this is a very hard winter the women and children are starving and freezing if this were summer i would say to keep on fighting to the end but we cannot do this we must think of the women and children and that it is very bad for them so we must make peace and i will see that nobody is hurt by the soldiers

5714697 how to implement a cost visibility and chargeback process using the resource consumption model
5714698 many organizations recognize the need for chargeback as they virtualize their infrastructures but they simply do not know where to start the challenge is that in the new virtual data center where all hardware is shared it needs to develop new ways to report on and account for the usage of shared resources cpu memory storage network etc
5714699 without cost visibility it is impossible to put in place the financial controls necessary to implement virtualization effectively the goal of this workshop is to walk attendees through a step by step approach for implementing chargeback and gaining cost visibility in as little as a day
5714700 businesses are taking steps to make their it operations more dynamic and are delving into virtualization as a cornerstone strategy
5714701 said zane adam senior director of integrated virtualization in the server and tools business at microsoft
5714702 microsoft recognizes this and is innovating its licensing policies product support and a wide range of it solutions to help customers get virtual now
5714703 idc research is finding that the use of server virtualization is moving past the early adopter stage and is quickly becoming a mainstream solution
5714704 as it professionals update their standard server images for new installations they are increasingly integrating virtualization to simplify deployments to increase the system flexibility boost usage rates and increase portability of the applications with this latest update to its licensing rules microsoft is knocking down barriers to virtualized deployments which should help further accelerate the adoption rates
5714705 novell and microsoft continue to collaborate to optimize bidirectional virtualization between windows server and suse linux enterprise with xen microsofts server virtualization validation program provides customers with additional peace of mind when they run windows as a guest in a validated environment such as suse linux enterprise
5714706 these defendants set up an offshore manufacturing facility where in unsanitary conditions they reproduced leading pharmaceutical products for importation into the united states all without fda approval or licensing from the rightful patent holders
5714707 we decided to enter a plea to reduce the exposure that jared and the company and all the defendants had in this case
5714708 its one of these situations where in order to get past this and have a life and not have to face the prospect of 20 years to life in prison you have to cut your losses
5714709 it was in stevies best interest as his fellow defendants had reached plea agreements
5714710 were optimistic he will not have to serve any more time as he served a lengthy time 17 months before being released on bond
5714711 the cases are resolved and im happy for everyone that its over
5714712 we negotiated long and hard to get to that result and sergio and i are pleased that we are able to end this and hes looking forward to getting on with his life
5714713 in terms of this criminal case there will be no more threat to the corporation as an operating entity
5714714 we still have the ftc but my belief is that the company will continue to operate
5714715 its not only johnnys getting fat and heart disease down the road all thats true but its also that he might not do as well in school
5714716 we use exercise as a tool for studying because we would never get through it
5714717 teachers say the kids are more alert when they come to the classroom
5714718 as you might expect when you eliminate children from games theyre less active because theyre sitting on the sidelines

5714727 college presidents from about 100 of the nations best known universities including duke dartmouth and ohio state are calling on lawmakers to consider lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18 saying current laws actually encourage dangerous binge drinking on campus
5714728 for the first time scientists have proven that beer goggles are real other people really do look more attractive to us if we have been drinking
5714729 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5714730 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5714731 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how
5714732 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5714733 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5714734 people to their passion of sports through the power of place
5714735 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5714736 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5714737 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5714738 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5714739 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5714740 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5714741 i truly believe theres been a lot of good progress
5714742 and then an ap videographer contacted her friend pigeon and thats how we got the proper pronunciation
5714743 it turned out that when they voted libertarian they thought they were voting for joe lieberman
5714744 the nuns at st genevieves literally beat that into my head by the time i was 7 years old
5714745 but lets suppose it was a different actor or actress i think campaigns are so built to appeal to the majority to 95 percent of the electorate and that runs counter to being funny
5714746 i dont think they want anyone to find out that they have fiction writers writing for them but the worst would be if it got out that the guy who wrote step brothers is writing his material
5714747 if we were to become part of a campaign we would become for better or worse part of large bureaucracies with competing agendas
5714748 just as john mccain has embraced george bushs policies hes embraced his politics and the same people who brought you george bush are now trying to package john mccain
5714749 youre only here for a short visit dont hurry dont worry and be sure to smell the flowers along the way
5714750 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5714751 i saw the england club doctor and after he had examined my ankle we both agreed that it would be too risky to play against slovenia
5714752 theres no doubt i would like to go to a major tournament i havent been for a few years and that appeals to anyone
5714753 the disappointments of the last few tournaments thats in the back of your head and you would love to go to another world cup
5714754 i was fortunate enough to go in 2002 so that enticed me to come back
5714755 he is very happy and is looking forward to playing in the premier league with west bromwich albion we believe this is a great opportunity for him
5714756 i knew i was looking for someone who was going to get us goals and im sure hell do just that with the service hell be getting
5714757 hes not blessed with a massive amount of pace but hes an aerial threat and a poacher and thats what i think were lacking
5714758 i told him that i was very ambitious and the only way that i can have my ambitions met is by winning and youre only going to win by scoring goals
5714759 it took me five years to get to the premier league after i left villa so it was a great day for me made even better by our first win
5714760 this is a different challenge for me at this level and it will be a magnificent achievement if the club can continue to build in the way it has done over the time i have been at hull
5714761 i dont want to lose any of the players i have at the moment but that doesnt stop other clubs from being interested in them
5714762 weve heard nothing from reading and at the moment it is purely paper talk
5714763 chris has had a scan and has been given the all clear to return to training and will be available for selection on saturday
5714764 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
5714765 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
5714766 i told him if he allowed turbines in that field he would lose a son
5714767 i tell people its not a wind farm its an industrial development
5714768 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5714769 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5714770 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5714771 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5714772 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5714773 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5714774 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
5714775 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
5714776 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore
5714777 there are nuclear weapons materials in more than 40 countries some secured by nothing more than a chain link fence and at the current pace it will be decades before this material is adequately secured
5714778 the worlds second largest muslim nation could become a failed state with an arsenal of nuclear weapons and a population larger than those of iran iraq afghanistan and north korea combined
5714779 i just tried to focus and not read their names
5714780 i knew the medal was safe but i tried to get the gold i kept thinking that this was the moment ive been dreaming of
5714781 i could hear the other guys breathing and i sprinted
5714782 internationally very few other people knew who i even was
5714783 he is the standard we all raced today very much watching him im sure
5714784 we piled the pressure on him and said that he was the favorite
5714785 today there were three athletes faster than me i say congratulations to them and i hope to try it again in four years
5714786 my tendon was really bothering me and i know in the last kilometer that i was dead
5714787 i always believe you go so early that it just takes pure willpower to go with you
5714788 est pour nicolas carr le type m me des nouvelles usines fonctionnant sur le mod le du taylorisme propose un autre point de vue
5714789 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5714790 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5714791 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5714792 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5714793 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
5714794 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
5714795 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
5714796 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
5714797 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
5714798 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
5714799 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5714800 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
5714801 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5714802 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5714803 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5714804 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5714805 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5714806 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5714807 they told me there are going to be resources here
5714808 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5714809 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5714810 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5714811 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5714812 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5714813 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5714814 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5714815 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5714816 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5714817 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5714818 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5714819 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5714820 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5714821 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5714822 i had a regular gig flying aerosmith around for about a month
5714823 i become a senior groupie i really liked those guys
5714824 business wise its like renting space on an empty 18 wheeler after youve dropped off your delivery the advantage to flying a charter is you dont wait in line and at many small airports limousines can drive up to the airplane
5714825 the plane i fly holds 4 500 gallons and jet fuel sells for 7 a gallon on top of that we have about 1 million in fixed costs for the one airplane the faa requires monthly inspections you cant just hang out a shingle and become a charter company
5714826 when you finally get on the plane after waiting in the long line you sit in the center seat for a four hour flight
5714827 the kid in back of you is kicking your seat you get a 5 box of snacks you wouldnt eat if it was free
5714828 and who is sitting next to you you have a discussion with a business associate but you never know who is listening in on the conversation
5714829 there are three groups of people that fly on our aircraft
5714830 you have your high net worth individuals you have the people in the sports and entertainment industry and you have your corporate executives and political figures
5714831 youll never look at commercial flying in quite the same way youll never want to go back to ohare
5714832 youre able to make two or three stops in different cities in one day
5714833 on one of our flights you can get surf and turf sushi shrimp and champagne there is no boundary if you have the means
5714834 on the ground that civilization has a right to preserve itself
5714835 it shows that a sense of justice yet lives among the people
5714836 he was a great man a heroic soul who fought for power over evil his whole life long in the interest of the common people and they loved and honored him
5714837 it is now entirely clear to me that as his cranial structure and hair type prove lassalle is descended from the negroes who joined moses flight from egypt that is assuming his mother or his paternal grandmother did not cross with a nigger the officiousness of the fellow is also nigger like
5714838 those who believe in unrestricted immigration want this country chinaized but i firmly believe that there are too many right thinking people in our country to permit such an evil
5714839 it must be clear to every thinking man and woman that while there is hardly a single reason for the admission of asiatics there are hundreds of good and strong reasons for their absolute exclusion
5714840 devised for the happiness of certain kindred races it is devised so as to give more strength to these certain kindred favored races so that they may survive and inherit the earth to the extinction of the lesser weaker races
5714841 four hundred million indefatigable workers deft intelligent and unafraid to die aroused and rejuvenescent managed and guided by forty five million additional human beings who are splendid fighting animals scientific and modern constitute that menace to the western world which has been well named the yellow peril
5714842 the white population of the world will soon cease to increase the asiatic races will be longer and the negroes still longer before their birth rate falls sufficiently to make their numbers stable without help of war and pestilence until that happens the benefits aimed at by socialism can only be partially realized and the less prolific races will have to defend themselves against the more prolific by methods which are disgusting even if they are necessary
5714843 one more institution built by whites for whites will have been set aside because non whites could not meet its demands
5714844 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5714845 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5714846 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5714847 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5714848 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5714849 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5714850 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5714851 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5714852 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5714853 were sorry but the head you are calling has been disconnected
5714854 obamas granny has selected the vp she will announce this afternoon at 5 00 pm eastern time
5714855 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5714856 free us from our addiction to oil from 4 00 plus per gallon gas
5714857 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5714858 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5714859 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5714860 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5714861 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it
5714862 we stress the urgency of swift complete and good faith implementations of the withdrawal agreement
5714863 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5714864 well i just know that the russian president said several days ago russian military operations would stop they didnt
5714865 this time i hope he means it you know the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces
5714866 the first priority is to provide practical and political support to georgia
5714867 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5714868 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
5714869 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
5714870 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
5714871 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
5714872 the first patent describes every remotely user content driven site ever i have a sneaking suspicion here that everyone on this forum could be sued successfully if this holds up
5714873 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5714874 i am pleased to endorse my friend bob tuke to be the next u
5714875 but bob is more than a candidate with timely solutions to pressing problems facing our nation and our planet he is also a man of great honor and integrity bob has the life experience that we need to turn our country around as a marine combat veteran in vietnam bob led troops in battle the u s senate would be well served to have his perspective as we finally bring an end to the mismanaged war in iraq these are just a few of the reasons that i am proud to give him my full support and endorsement
5714876 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs

5714881 hey theres no bottom to hit so its gotta be safe to jump into it
5714882 were seeing that when these ceramic flat irons are used at the highest heat settings and on a daily basis to achieve straight hair they can really take a toll on the structure of the hair and cause very noticeable problems that can be hard to repair
5714883 if you look at the sales statistics you see that people are pursuing straighter hair with more vigour
5714884 most people on tv and in films have straight hair and its a trend the public is trying to emulate
5714885 the problem starts when they do it wrong or too frequently and they cause a real mess that takes a long time to fix
5714886 saudi arabia has been and continues to look out for the security stability and sovereignty of pakistan and will not interfere in its internal affairs he was quoted as saying
5714887 we are delighted that the british public has voted enid blyton its best loved author
5714888 her storytelling is timeless and this result confirms that her books are still a firm favourite today
5714889 according to our reports about 30 taliban tried to attack the salerno base
5714890 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5714891 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5714892 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5714893 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5714894 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5714895 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5714896 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5714897 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5714898 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5714899 uranium mining has taken our country away from us and destroyed it mining and the millions of dollars in royalties have not improved our quality of life
5714900 the greatest minds in the nuclear establishment have been searching for an answer to the radioactive waste problem for fifty years and theyve finally got one haul it down a dirt road and dump it on an indian reservation
5714901 for eight years in the white house every weapons proliferation problem we dealt with was connected to a civilian reactor program and if we ever got to the point where we wanted to use nuclear reactors to back out a lot of coal then wed have to put them in so many places wed run that proliferation risk right off the reasonability scale
5714902 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5714903 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5714904 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5714905 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5714906 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5714907 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5714908 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5714909 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5714910 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5714911 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5714912 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5714913 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5714914 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5714915 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5714916 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5714917 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5714918 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5714919 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5714920 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5714921 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5714922 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5714923 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5714924 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5714925 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5714926 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5714927 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5714928 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5714929 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5714930 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5714931 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5714932 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5714933 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5714934 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5714935 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5714936 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5714937 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5714938 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5714939 we are carefully considering all the comments and expect to make an announcement in the autumn
5714940 we consider this closure would be seriously detrimental to residents in the area

5714944 the range of his scholarship is unparalleled his productivity is off the board its incredible
5714945 his addition to fsus real estate faculty raises our overall research rankings to top five status among the nations universities and places us alongside programs located at such great institutions as the university of california berkeley illinois and wisconsin

5714952 estoy absolutamente convencido de que en las pr ximas semanas los propios tribunales dir n qu hay de malo en preguntar a la sociedad vasca y que por tanto podremos hacer ese debate
5714953 absolutamente ilusionado y lleno de fuerza para afrontar el liderazgo pol tico y socio econ mico del pa s
5714954 situar en la agenda pol tica de europa el debate en torno a los derechos de los pueblos europeos entre ellos el vasco a realizar consultas
5714955 el derecho a decidir de la sociedad vasca y de todos los pueblos del mundo ser visto cada vez con mayor normalidad en el mbito del estado espa ol y de la uni n europea y cada vez formar m s parte de la agenda pol tica en europa
5714956 mostrar cercan a con las v ctimas es un objetivo honesto pero ni la teor a de construir imputaciones para volver a encarcelarle ni el estar hablando todos los d as en los peri dicos de de juana no creo que haga ning n favor a las v ctimas
5714957 hace da o a la imagen de euskadi en el mundo
5714958 the great enemy of clear language is insincerity when there is a gap between ones real and ones declared aims one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms like a cuttlefish spurting out ink
5714959 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5714960 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5714961 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5714962 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5714963 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5714964 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5714965 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5714966 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5714967 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5714968 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5714969 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5714970 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5714971 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5714972 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5714973 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5714974 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5714975 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5714976 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5714977 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5714978 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5714979 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5714980 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5714981 reporters are grumbling more and more that the campaign is acting like the prom queen they gripe that it is arrogant and control ling and the campaigns own belief that obama is poised to make history isnt endearing either the press certainly helped obama get so far so fast the question is how far can he get if his campaign alienates them
5714982 end of the affair barack obama and the press break up
5714983 the problem is not that democrats are monolithically pro choice or anti school prayer its that by dropping the class language that once distinguished them sharply from republicans they have left themselves vulnerable to cultural wedge issues like guns and abortion and the rest whose hallucinatory appeal would ordinarily be overshadowed by material concerns we are in an environment where republicans talks constantly about class in a coded way to be sure but where democrats are afraid to bring it up
5714984 since i run a small computer repair business of my own i have a handful of guys working with me and i always stress to them that i want happy customers first through decent work and second by never making the customer feel stupid even if the customer made a mistake or did something stupid
5714985 although i like to think im practicing a little buddhist or socialist right livelihood here its also sound capitalism since happy customers not only come back they tell other people that your work was good and you treated them well and so they bring you more customers
5714986 we print critiques of obama all the time and dont have to go into your hyperbole

5714992 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5714993 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5714994 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5714995 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5714996 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5714997 were still in consultation so nothing is official but regardless of the outcome we will still be offering something more generous than competitors and at least twice the statutory requirement

5715004 my 2 children are the greatest gift ive ever been given
5715005 i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share
5715006 hell rub my feet at any time sometimes i even wake him up to rub my feet hes the best husband i could ever ask for
5715007 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
5715008 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
5715009 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
5715010 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
5715011 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
5715012 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
5715013 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
5715014 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
5715015 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
5715016 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
5715017 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5715018 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5715019 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5715020 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5715021 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5715022 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5715023 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5715024 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5715025 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5715026 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5715027 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5715028 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5715029 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5715030 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5715031 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5715032 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5715033 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5715034 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5715035 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5715036 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5715037 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5715038 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5715039 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5715040 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5715041 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5715042 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5715043 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5715044 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5715045 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5715046 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5715047 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5715048 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5715049 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5715050 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5715051 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5715052 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5715053 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5715054 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5715055 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
5715056 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
5715057 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
5715058 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
5715059 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
5715060 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
5715061 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
5715062 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
5715063 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
5715064 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
5715065 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
5715066 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5715067 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5715068 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5715069 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5715070 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5715071 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
5715072 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5715073 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5715074 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5715075 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5715076 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5715077 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5715078 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
5715079 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5715080 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5715081 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5715082 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5715083 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5715084 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5715085 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5715086 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5715087 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5715088 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5715089 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
5715090 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
5715091 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
5715092 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
5715093 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
5715094 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5715095 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5715096 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
5715097 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
5715098 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5715099 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5715100 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5715101 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5715102 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5715103 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5715107 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5715108 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5715109 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5715110 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5715111 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5715112 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5715113 billofrights can you not see the irony that you use the phrase
5715114 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
5715115 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
5715116 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
5715117 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am

5715119 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
5715120 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
5715121 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason

5715279 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5715280 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one

5715289 the cost of transporting finished goods from india had risen to a level that it was too expensive and made better sense to have a location in the u s to be closer to their market because much of their finished goods were being sold here
5715290 man industries manufactures 80 foot long joints of pipe which really cant be transported over the road the well making it necessary to find a location with port and rail access
5715291 little rock is just off the mississippi and arkansas rivers

5715332 joost has a particular concern over the marketing and cross promotional opportunities available to the joint venture the joint ventures shareholders represent the uks three most significant broadcasters in a unique position with privileged access to analogue terrestrial spectrum and gifted spectrum on digital terrestrial

5715336 i think thats also a big part of what marketers want to do
5715337 they absolutely want to protect that tv audience but youve got to give them credit because they are streaming a ton of stuff online

5715389 i can think of no better way of marking his historic success than by naming scotlands only world class track cycling facility after him
5715390 elite sport cannot stand alone without local facilities giving kids the chance to get into the sport
5715391 i really hope edinburgh is going to continue to produce world champion cyclists in the future but we cannot do this without a local facility
5715392 we have been working very closely with the governing body scottish cycling who say that the city needs a regional facility our members are committed to creating that

5715409 ich sah wie sie sich verkrampfte dann haben sie sie eingewickelt und mitgenommen
5715410 ich bin sicher dass sie sich bewegt hat und ich wei nicht was dann passiert ist

5715415 for mccain not only does it patriotism arise from his very being his identity but it plays a dual role of emphasizing a national security part of the campaign and the contrast between him and obama
5715416 hes going to demonstrate love of country by word and deed at the convention
5715417 its not something that you repeat i am patriot there are no specific patriotic activities its got to come across at an authentic and sincere way
5715418 there is a historic suspicion that african americans are less patriotic
5715419 conservative whites look at them blacks as unpatriotic and yet if you look at the constitution and the history the black community has been trying to make that constitution work for everybody
5715420 he has been in combat and i have been in combat but just because he is a military man running for office doesnt mean he has the right to run the country

5715426 i spoke to him just now and he said everything is ok he is happy to be going home he was in a good mood
5715427 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5715428 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5715429 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5715430 i would hope that the authorities make sure that gary glitter does not slip off to another country
5715431 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5715432 glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children
5715433 on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm
5715434 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual

5715436 the scale of russian military activity is very large and that is why georgians are talking about an invasion and why the rest of the world not just in the eu but elsewhere around the un are saying that russia must live up to the commitments it has made to withdraw before the august 7 boundaries

5715522 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
5715523 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5715524 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5715525 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5715534 does this darkness have a name this cruelty this hatred how did it find us did it steal into our lives or did we seek it out and embrace it what happened to us that we now send our children into the world like we send young men to war hoping for their safe return but knowing that some would be lost along the way when did we lose our way consumed by the shadows swallowed whole by the darkness does this darkness have a name is it your name
5715535 sometimes when youre young you think nothing can hurt you its like being invincible your whole life is ahead of you when you have big plans find your perfect match the one who completes you but as you get older you realize its not always that easy its not till the end of your life that you realize how the plans you made were simply plans because at the end when youre looking back instead of forward you wanna believe that you made the best of what life gave you you wanna believe that youre leaving something good behind you want it all to matter

5715567 wir haben es hierbei mit einer sehr gut organisierten schmuggelmafia zu tun
5715568 das problem dabei ist dass nicht nur die arten durch derartigen handel gef hrdet werden sondern dass zudem ein enormer ansturm auf die einheimischen zoos losbricht denn in denen werden die eingeschmuggelten tiere dann betreut
5715569 sie k nnen selbst objekte mit geringem eigengeruch wahrnehmen und sind daher ideal f r die schnelle kontrolle von gep ckst cken postsendungen oder ganzen containern

5715580 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5715581 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5715582 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5715583 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5715584 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5715585 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5715586 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had

5715623 what drove us to netsuite was both its lower cost and greater feature set
5715624 we needed our crm data integrated with our accounting and erp data providing a complete solution to provide better all around support to our customers netsuite provided more out of the box functionality at a much lower investment on the order of thousands of dollars compared to the great plains microsoft crm combination
5715625 netsuite gives us everything in one system and its web based saving our residential program even more money because we dont need to invest in and maintain a client server architecture like our parent company needed for great plains
5715626 after a little more than two years of using great plains and salesforce com we decided we really needed a completely integrated system to gain better visibility so we switched to netsuite
5715627 the problem with great plains was that it didnt allow the operations group to view vendor and customer related information with netsuites integrated platform both our operations group and accounting group are much more effective and efficient without added costs of great plains licenses on top of salesforce com licenses additionally the ability to access our accounting information along with crm data from anywhere in the country is a huge benefit for our company we fully utilize the netsuite accounting functionality as well as sales force automation and email marketing campaigns on a daily basis
5715628 weve been using it for about six months now and its drastically better than microsoft great plains which was too complex with netsuite we can purchase product create orders for customers and then ship collect money and support those customers and pay our bills we can see more metrics across the business because we dont require integration with other systems
5715629 the best thing about netsuite is its ease of use
5715630 great plains required a lot of time effort and help from external developer and consulting resources that added to the on going cost of maintenance we had to use separate applications with it and it wasnt smooth to pass from one application to another with netsuite everything is integrated and we have real time access across all our core business operations

5715633 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5715634 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5715635 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence

5715671 netflix is positioned for dramatic eps growth as streaming adoption increases

5715675 im sorry sir we cant redeliver the last component in the system because all of these deliveries come in a bundle
5715676 but the components were delivered to me separately not in a bundle
5715677 your contract clearly states that the components will be delivered separately
5715678 they are which is why we cant redeliver once ups returns for lack of delivery
5715679 but my contract states that they may be delivered separately
5715680 not when they are in a bundle well be giving you a refund
5715681 while 39 of those interviewed have given or lent substantial sums to their children or grandchildren only 22 of those interviewed have received substantial money gifts or loans from their parents or grandparents
5715682 so the paradox is that while our society is getting richer it is increasingly dependent on intergenerational gifts and worryingly half of these gifts are associated with the investments needed just to get started in life
5715683 investors were encouraged to take comfort in the fact that inertia was based in the uk so their investment was supposedly safe
5715684 in fact it was transferring substantial sums of investors money to an unauthorised overseas organisation

5715699 la provincia no deber a recurrir a los fondos aportados por lo trabajadores para cubrir el d ficit financiero
5715700 es un tema delicado pero creemos que el ips debe seguir siendo aut nomo y que se deber a reclamar lo que corresponde de coparticipaci n
5715701 la ucr tiene un postura tomada respecto del manejo de los fondos que est haciendo la provincia
5715702 deber a seguir siendo aut nomo ya que es un organismo superavitario creemos que la provincia atraviesa una situaci n delicada y que no va a intentar recurrir al cr dito externo sino que va a paliar su d ficit con los fondos del ips
5715703 es un tema sumamente delicado ya que se est hablando de los aportes de los trabajadores lo mismo ocurre cuando se habla de la posibilidad de incorporar la caja de jubilaci n de la polic a al ips tenemos una postura firme al respecto
5715704 hay que analizar cu les son los t rminos en los que se modifica el manejo de los fondos previsionales porque hasta ahora hay un uso indebido de los aportes del empleado ya que el ips debe disponer del super vit que genera
5715705 entendemos que hay que seguir respetando la movilidad y la autonom a en el manejo de la caja policial y el ips y analizar la incorporaci n de la caja del bapro
5715706 se podr a ver solucionado en parte si se le reclamara a la naci n los fondos que nos corresponden en concepto de coparticipaci n no es justo que una provincia cuyos habitantes produzcan el 40 de las riquezas reciba tan s lo un 20 eso significa unos 6 000 millones menos de pesos
5715707 hay que garantizar que esta reforma no sea un mecanismo para redireccionar fondos en la provincia
5715708 si se permite que el estado utilice fondos de las jubilaciones puede pasar lo que ocurri en la poca de el ex ministro de econom a domingo cavallo donde se obligaba a las afjp a prestarle dinero al estado
5715709 el ips funciona en forma deficiente por lo tanto hay que conocer las garant as para seguir incorporando subsistemas a un organismo deficiente

5715730 the stories of that period always seemed to follow the same pattern
5715731 how the bright young man arrived in the city fresh from law school where he was put to work immediately on business of utmost urgency how he went for days without sleep
5715732 a lesson fully understood by the southerners in congress they didnt need to have majorities on their side they didnt need to have public opinion on their side they didnt need the president on their side they only needed to have the rules on their side

5715747 the idea of providing a hard boiled egg into retail stores seemed like a natural progression
5715748 eggs are so easily forgotten when planning meals at home they can be seen as a fridge filler and consumers need to be reminded that they are a versatile value for money alternative to other protein foods
5715749 it is perfect for packed lunches and picnics and inspires the use of eggs in sandwiches salads and meals without having to allow for the preparation time
5715750 ja dat is er ook wel aan te zien uiteraard

5715896 the western media especially cnn is feeding you complete horseshit russia did not invade georgia first
5715897 missile defense washington and poland just moved the world closer to war
5715898 the signing now insures an escalation of tensions between russia and nato and a new cold war arms race in full force it is important for readers to understand the ability of one of two opposing sides to put anti missile missiles to within 90 miles of the territory of the other in even a primitive first generation anti missile missile array gives that side virtual victory in a nuclear balance of power and forces the other to consider unconditional surrender or to pre emptively react by launching its nuclear strike before 2012
5715899 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
5715900 us troops on monday july 14 began military exercises near the russian border in ex soviet ukraine and were poised to launch them in georgia amid tense relations between moscow and washington a ceremony inaugurating the sea breeze 2008 nato exercise was held off ukraines black sea coast against anti nato protests and a hostile reaction from officials in russia sea breeze 2008 includes forces from armenia azerbaijan belgium britain canada denmark france georgia germany greece latvia macedonia and turkey the us georgia joint exercises will be held at the vaziani military base less than 100 kilometers 60 miles from the russian border with a total of 1 650 servicemen taking part
5715901 this is a formula for an injection of us military and naval forces into georgia of indeterminate scope and duration it will certainly involve the presence of hundreds if not thousands of uniformed us military personnel on the ground and a substantial number of warships in the region the us is introducing this military force into a situation that remains highly unstable and combustible raising the possibility of a direct military clash between the united states and russia

5715907 its a special day chris always steps up for these occasions its momentous he has achieved something that is going to sit in the history books for some time i would hope
5715908 hard work and chris are synonymous he works hard all of the time the one thing i think typifies him is that after every competition he sits down and evaluates what would need to be done to take it to the next level
5715909 i have no doubt that if chris chooses to carry on and focuses himself then there is no question that 2012 is within his reach
5715910 he has completely raised the profile of cycling particularly within the olympics
5715911 now taxi drivers and shop keepers are all talking about cycling here in scotland
5715912 i think he has justified himself as an ambassador for the sport
5715913 his performances will be inspirational for youngsters coming through the pathway programme chris and his success have certainly put cycling on the map
5715914 jasons a good competitor and chris had to have his wits about him but he just had more power
5715915 they cancelled his event the kilo and all the training from that hes just transferred to the sprint and the kierin and he has been phenomenal at it

5715980 the most important thing for developing lasting connections online is to always be genuine youll attract people who are best suited to your personality which creates deeper connections
5715981 it would be easy to spend two to three hours per day following multiple networks ive done that at certain points but i dont really have that kind of time now so i usually commit to about an hour a day
5715982 social networking is not something that is easy it takes time and commitment although ive had overnight successes with some of my efforts a far greater percentage of my success comes from relationships that have been built over time
5715983 the absolute greatest result of social networking has been the long term friendships and business alliances that have developed over time on top of that its likely that one of my businesses would have never come into existence had it not been for those relationships

5715992 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5715993 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5715994 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5715995 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimise sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep

5716019 comienza la loa con una corta introducci n musical de 38 compases en tiempo allegro terminada la cual entra a cantar la primera soprano amor qui n altern ndose en el canto con la otra solista cuidado reclama la atenci n de mar tierra monte y playa puntos clave determinantes de nuestra insularidad para entonar alabanzas a la virgen
5716020 a son mayor los ngeles del amor voces de oro
5716021 su estructura musical es sencilla sin complicaciones arm nicas muy al estilo de la poca siguiendo las corrientes italianas que estaban en boga es muy melanc lica y sencillamente encantadora
5716022 los ngeles solistas fueron encarnados por los j venes jaime matheu luego c lebre tenor en cuba cipriano valc rcel como bar tono y jaime viera oriundo de lanzarote
5716023 salve numen de los n menes madre del divino verbo
5716024 nuestro artista pudo tener defectos de armon a y composici n pero super tales debilidades con la profunda sensibilidad que exhalan sus sublimes melod as
5716025 lo hizo por estar concebida en forma elemental para pocos instrumentos
5716026 la loa est instrumentada para una orquesta reducida flauta violines viola cello y piano o armonio en este siglo el as santos rodr guez la complet con otros instrumentos de metal y madera una introducci n orquestal da la entrada del coro mixto a tres voces terminado el cual se cantan las dos arias por los ngeles extremos seguidas del d o con intervenci n del ngel central y concluye con un concertante o apoteosis con solistas y coros
5716027 la armonizaci n es sencilla dado el modesto bagaje t cnico del autor pero la composici n posee alt simo nivel de inspiraci n la l nea mel dica italianizante es de elegante factura dulce perfecta en su simplicidad y sin concesiones al virtuosismo local destacan la et rea bondad de las arias y la espiritualidad del concertante y dir ase sin duda que las sombras tutelares de bellini y donizetti se ciernen sobre ella
5716028 alegr a melanc lica del recuerdo y los ojos se nublan con el cristal borroso y tr mulo de las l grimas que afloran pasan en desfile cinematogr fico por la imaginaci n momentos seres queridos paisajes y muchas cosas que un d a fueron estuvieron aqu en el d a m s grande religiosamente hablando de santa cruz de la palma
5716029 we have not changed our plans the strategy remains thesame on that point
5716030 we respect private interests but no private interest canbe above the interests of the people
5716031 we are confident that we possess the keys to a successfulturnaround the support of our vendors and other businesspartners access to sufficient liquidity under our asset basedcredit facility and the dedication of our experiencedmanagement team
5716032 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5716033 he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5716034 i will let no one question my love of this country
5716035 i love america so do you and so does john mccain when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5716036 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5716037 the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large russia has invaded the sovereign nation of georgia iran is pursuing nuclear weapons the next commander in chief is going to have to exercise the best possible judgment in getting us through these difficult times
5716038 six years ago i stood up at a time when it was politically difficult to oppose going to war in iraq and argued that our first priority had to be finishing the fight against osama bin laden and al qaeda in afghanistan
5716039 sen mccain was already turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 and he became a leading supporter of an invasion and occupation of a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks and that as despicable as saddam hussein was posed no imminent threat to the american people
5716040 sen mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues
5716041 for the good of our country i wish he had been right and i had been wrong but thats not what history shows
5716042 our military is badly overstretched a fact that has surely been noted in capitals around the world
5716043 and while we pay a heavy price in iraq and americans pay record prices at the pump iraqs government is sitting on a 79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits
5716044 this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5716045 sen mccain argued that we could just and i quote muddle through in afghanistan and only came around to supporting my call for more troops last month
5716046 russian troops have yet to begin the withdrawal required by the cease fire signed by their president and we are hearing reports of russian atrocities burning wheat fields brutal killings and the destruction of georgias infrastructure and military assets

5716083 the governments in victoria south australia and queensland are pretty clean governments but nsw has never got over the rum rebellion
5716084 nsw is very tribal and you have a mates culture in nsw that does not belong in any other state which leads to an acceptance of sanctified corruption
5716085 the perception is that we keep exposing it and nothing happens
5716086 half hearted and cosmetic approaches to preventing public sector corruption
5716087 we have seen a minister of the crown jailed for bribery an inquiry into a second and indeed a third former minister for alleged corruption the former chief stipendiary magistrate jailed for perverting the course of justice a former commissioner of police in the courts on a criminal charge and a disturbing number of dismissals retirements and convictions of senior police officers for offences involving corrupt conduct

5716090 in the 21st century a sea level rise of at least 0 5 metres is a certainty a rise of 1 to 1 5 metres is more likely while a rise of up to four metres this century is possible
5716091 it is an issue of significant magnitude and it does need proper assessment and all governments working together to minimise the risks and ensure there is as little damage as possible
5716092 this really is very early work and many more factors need to be taken into account before we have concrete projections
5716093 it is going to be a negative story leading to damage of assets and loss of value
5716094 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine

5716103 if you had introduced me as president bush id be convinced that bill gwatney wrote the script for your service
5716104 i am more grateful than i can say for the support he gave to hillary in this long last year
5716105 we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5716106 he could have taken a lot of other roads but he chose public service

5716442 the symbol seems to offer a bit more luxury a bit more refinement but at an affordable price
5716443 the great enterprise the manchu reconstruction of imperial order in seventeenth century china
5716444 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
5716445 the central tenet of our dont buy aig argument is simple the intricacies of aigs business are so complex that management may not even know the extent of the companys ultimate exposures let alone losses
5716446 specifically we foresee 9 billion to 20 billion in economic losses from the cds book which could result in larger cash outlays resulting in a significant shift in the risk quality of aigs assets forcing rating agencies downgrades and resulting in large scale capital raises
5716447 the railway line between baku and batumi oil port is not usable at the moment
5716448 i am not worried you have to give them time he is 19 years old
5716449 theo is not yet completely there collectively but he can make decisions in big games that will always be his strength
5716450 he is a boy who will always make progress because he is intelligent and he knows where he wants to get and that is why i believe you have to patient with him
5716451 i believe that when everyone is sharp we will have much more invention
5716452 but of course you always want a player like fabregas to be in there because he gives you the quality of the pass
5716453 i immediately saw the england club doctor and after he had examined my ankle we both agreed that it would be too risky to play against slovenia
5716454 i left the england camp at 9am yesterday morning and was driven straight to the
5716455 i had a scan on my ankle and there is nothing broken or anything like that
5716456 i should be back in training in the next couple of days and i will be ready for saturdays match with
5716457 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5716458 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5716459 we are aware of his passport number and will happily assist mr gadd to the intended destination in case he has second thoughts about stopping off here
5716460 he is ok but he is worried about his health he has problems with his hearing and his heart
5716461 muito estranho o caso est exigindo muito da nossa pol cia uma investiga o que n s vamos ter que aprofundar muito porque existe uma s ria de hip teses e nenhuma pode ser descartada n s temos uma linha de investiga o mas para preservar os trabalhos acho melhor n o divulgar isso
5716462 most of our clients were moving to an soa and web services architecture integrating many different applications into their external web site for example the sonic esb allowed us to implement customer client business processes with zero manual effort that is perhaps our biggest payback
5716463 two important business goals for the next 12 months include adding to our client base and improving the end user experience the sonic esb is helping mccamish achieve and ultimately exceed these goals
5716464 mccamish systems is a great example of a longstanding user of the progress openedge business application development platform and a progress application partner that sees the operational and financial value in implementing a services based architecture
5716465 mccamish was very comfortable with the openedge platform and found the sonic esb to be the cost effective choice in helping them deliver reliable and high quality service as a result mccamishs partners can introduce new insurance products rapidly and seamlessly while maintaining product profitability
5716466 there are no safety implications it is a question of dealing with minor issues before they become serious
5716467 one of the reactors was shut down as standard procedure but repairs to the plugs took longer than originally thought
5716468 the other was then shut down to enable work to be carried out on the supports
5716469 it is unusual for both reactors to be shut down at the same time and no electricity to be generated at all
5716470 we have no electricity being produced and we also have to pay for the repair work
5716471 also we have contracts with customers to supply power and so we have to buy supplies in and we are charged a premium rate
5716472 we cannot say when the reactors will be back online but its fair to say shortly i think we are on the home strait
5716473 to describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental
5716474 we dont know whether she was actually contacted by the wires and if it was one of the live wires or a ground wire or what it was exactly
5716475 the boom was supposed to be fully retracted and it wasnt
5716476 it caught the overhead trolley wires brought them down unfortunately there was a woman pedestrian in the vicinity she was taken to hospital
5716477 we wound up having to reroute our buses bring in the trolley overhead crew to repair the overhead wires they finally got that job done around two oclock this morning
5716478 may god punish them for the crime they have committed against these youngsters and their country
5716479 once again the algerian people are victims of indiscriminate and barbaric terrorist attacks
5716480 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5716481 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5716482 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5716483 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5716484 theyre looking for people that may be up trees or on cliffs
5716485 youd see boulders four foot in diameter being carried down the stream and whole trees
5716486 we did a lot of praying i told the boys its ok to be scared but were going to be ok
5716487 today we were able to book a spot in the semifinals and we have wakui to thank for his perfect pitching and the fact we scored 10 runs to make it a called game so it was a clear victory
5716488 i think the chinese pitchers were getting tired from this series and also our batters really responded well today to take advantage
5716489 they kind of used me as a kind of guinea pig juror to get a feel for what the jurors were thinking
5716490 if someone wants to become a lawyer the most important thing they can do is watch other good trial lawyers in action
5716491 he is focused and driven and easy to work with
5716492 i hang out with friends who are a good influence
5716493 he really is a renaissance man and he has great written and verbal communication skills
5716494 too often we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve
5716495 no i dont want fuckin fries now that you made my ears bleed you dumb ass mother fucker and quit yelling at me because ill yell at you back bitch
5716496 would you like a soft drink with that drive thru
5716497 i wish the rest of the kids were more like you
5716498 also for claritys sake i thought maybe i should tell you that my intentions are no more than platonic
5716499 hey buddy thats a nice car but why not spring for a real porsche and get a gt3
5716500 i leave that car to the professionals its better suited to the racetrack if you ask me
5716501 at 20 years of age the will reigns at 30 the wit at 40 the judgment
5716502 c nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
5716503 do we really have to do all of this again
5716504 if you want to be rich and happy dont go to school
5716505 we are excited to bring on board two investment firms as highly regarded as polaris and primus
5716506 we are confident that both of our new partners will be instrumental in accelerating the companys growth in 2008 and beyond we were interested in a business partner that could provide more than just capital and both of these firms fit the bill perfectly
5716507 very firmly condemns the terrorist acts that have just claimed so many lives
5716508 proud to join my friend senator joe biden in calling for an additional one billion dollars in reconstruction assistance for the people of georgia
5716509 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not
5716510 and he declared behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has so many times that i put personal ambition before my country
5716511 that is john mccains prerogative he can run that kind of campaign and frankly thats how political campaigns have been run in recent years but i believe the american people are better than that i believe that this defining moment demands something more of us
5716512 if we think that we can secure our country by just talking tough without acting tough and smart then we will misunderstand this moment and miss its opportunities
5716513 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5716514 but veterans support for mccain probably has more to do with their republican orientation than to their military service
5716515 the perception of the government of iraq is that this is a 10 foot enemy giant but it really is not now
5716516 i think we are going to do about five or six months of work here in about the next two weeks and i think thats quite honestly pretty realistic
5716517 we discussed his plan it looked good and then we just swapped war stories
5716518 i came here thinking i was prepared thoroughly but the result shows that it wasnt so
5716519 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5716520 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
5716521 if you had introduced me as president bush id be convinced that bill gwatney wrote the script for your service
5716522 i am more grateful than i can say for the support he gave to hillary in this long last year
5716523 we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5716524 he could have taken a lot of other roads but he chose public service
5716525 i am pro choice i believe in roe v wade
5716526 i am pro life and my administration will be a pro life administration
5716527 there is no healing from this that haunts me in the night
5716528 i just began using sis central and it has already proven to be a valuable tool
5716529 earlier i contacted the sis support team with an issue but then i quickly found a way to resolve it myself by searching the new knowledge base this really saved me some time and effort
5716530 sis central is the direct result of our listening to client feedback and implementing the tools they need to make the most of the sis solution
5716531 we continuously strive to find innovative ways to meet the needs of perioperative professionals and earn their trust as a long term partner this portal will be a great resource for current and future sis users that will continually evolve to help them excel at what they do each and every day
5716532 is something that cannot be tolerated under commonly accepted norms
5716533 it is natural that a stern punishment should be given if we judge the matter by the standards of the general public dismissal cant be helped well take a vote at the board meeting
5716534 we are pleased to again be able to present this fun exciting production about energy conservation and renewable energy
5716535 sexual orientation is a small part of a person i cannot see why a person should be reduced to sexual orientation
5716536 i cannot change people should be made aware that we are also human beings with feelings people stereotype gay persons but were just normal people
5716537 our analysis clearly shows incredible growth in online pc gaming proof that this industry is far stronger than anyone has reported todays consumers shop where they live online
5716538 dfc intelligence estimated that by the end of 2007 less than one third of households in the top 20 markets for games had a high speed internet connection that clearly indicates that there is still plenty of growth to come
5716539 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
5716540 3 d has come to the cinema as unique experiences what will it take to make it in the home and without glasses
5716541 we need to study the limits of 3 d technology and build tools to make it ubiquitous
5716542 there are three characteristics that mark the 3 d experience distance from the display the resolution of the display which are directly proportional to the experience and the interpupilary distance which is inversely proportional to the experience
5716543 better design for 3 d and working on 3 d solutions from the start to achieve the same quality in notebooks and games as in cinema
5716544 we need to start thinking in terms of 3 d the computing power will be available but the mindset needs to change
5716545 maybe we use the internet for that so that the content provider can adjust the transmission according to each individuals 3 d technology
5716546 a holographic system with its many sides allows each person to specify their point of viewing
5716547 it is not yet suitable for 3d movies but i believe we will be able to get to that capability
5716548 the medium we are using is capable of being rewritten every 100 microseconds far faster than is necessary for video but there are many other challenges including the technique for rewriting that fast it is possible to do it but we certainly cant do it yet i would suspect it will take several more years to get to that point
5716549 when we start talking about erasable and rewritable holograms we are moving toward the possibility of holographic tv it has now been shown that physically its possible
5716550 50 hours of high definition video on a single disc 50 000 songs on a postage stamp or 500 000 x rays on a credit card
5716551 there are all sorts of things we can do now and some extraordinary new applications on the horizon its an exciting time in the holographic world
5716552 angela domani mattina mi svegli tu per non in modo brusco con calma

5716557 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5716558 oh yeah you think youre so cool mr messiah of change well im going to get a big crowd and good press too
5716559 violates the mccain code in nearly every way he is vain but not experienced his campaign is focused on an individual not the greater good he has not demonstrated real courage in life or politics meanwhile a supercilious culture is tearing down salters idol

5716567 from receiving or applying for any grants or subsidies whether direct or indirect from the ioc in the amount of 1m 500 000
5716568 this shows the iocs determination to fight doping with zero tolerance
5716569 i think the ioc has taken an important step in the fight against doping
5716570 the italian report showed very clearly that a great quantity of medical equipment had been seized in this apartment used by athletes
5716571 this goes from saline solution syringes bags for storing blood and many other things
5716572 some athletes gave testimony in writing some did not in evaluating all this and the explanations we came to the conclusion that these athletes committed a violation of the anti doping rules by possessing medical devices and material
5716573 this possession alone was enough to constitute an offence a violation of the code
5716574 you have to imagine athletes living in apartments during the games surrounded by blood bags and syringes all these devices means it is almost impossible that these athletes did not know what was happening
5716575 it is important with all the focus on london 2012 we do not neglect the needs of our winter athletes
5716576 they must be provided with the best possible support to enable them to reach their olympic aspirations
5716577 there is no doubt it will stage a stunning olympic games the setting is spectacular and the venues are inspirational
5716578 the quality of the people we met and the information available in canada lead me to believe vancouver has the potential to set new standards for the winter games
5716579 fishburne will play a former pathologist who is now working as an itinerant college lecturer teaching a course in criminalistics his focus is on understanding criminal behavior how and why people commit acts of violence tendencies he disturbingly sees within himself in the course of a murder investigation he comes into contact with the csi team and ultimately joins the las vegas crime lab as a level 1 csi
5716580 our work is funded almost entirely through public donations so none of our work would be possible without the commitment of individuals like bill
5716581 and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
5716582 f or people to keep on pushing this is offensive
5716583 ok ma nn piangere ha gia pianto tua madre ha pianto tua sorella mo piangi tu cos fate piangere anke me
5716584 i could think of nothing greater than competing at the worlds biggest sporting event in our own backyard
5716585 i am told womens boxing could come into the games in 2012 and i would be prepared to get in a ring and fight for a medal
5716586 when sir clive presented me with the trophy we spoke at length and i was in awe of his depth of knowledge on creating leaders in world sport
5716587 he made me realise that i had almost reached the pinnacle of world skiing off my own back he also seemed surprised at the lack of science in skiing our sport is really behind in terms of using resources
5716588 the programme he put in place for our winning rugby world cup team was unlike anything i had ever heard of
5716589 the board continues to pursue strategic alternatives for the company that offer the best possible results for our shareholders in the long term
5716590 play a key role in leading the efforts to accelerate the pace of the companys turnaround
5716591 we are confident that we possess the keys to a successful turnaround the support of our vendors and other business partners access to sufficient liquidity under our asset based credit facility and the dedication of our experienced management team
5716592 the reason i went through with the surgery on my feet was because i needed some time away from the sport
5716593 i had just lost my mother who was my number one fan and i thought it was important to sit down and reflect on things
5716594 if i hadnt have done that im one of these extremists who would have over trained so i thought it was important to step back from the sport
5716595 i took three months off and it was really good closure for me
5716596 i feel no one expects much of me from this season because i have been through such a hard time but this leaves me free with no restrictions in my head
5716597 i feel i am really skiing fast because of it
5716598 if i look back at my skiing career every time ive had to go through a hardship ive skied fast
5716599 my mum and i had the same dreams she wanted me to be the number one racer and im just going to have to use that and ski fast with it
5716600 i did the surgery to be able to ski pain free it got to the stage where the pain was really hard for me to suppress and it was getting in the way of me winning races
5716601 i didnt get much chance to train beforehand but it was great to compete on a world stage and share such an experience im in the first year of my degree so hopefully ill compete in the university olympics in 2009
5716602 we dont know yet how he will organise his training and racing programme
5716603 bode decided to go independent but we will continue to support him as much as we can considering his new situation
5716604 well do you know when and how i let someone leave my staff
5716605 the only way you can leave my staff is in a pine wooden box
5716606 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5716607 actually it was a case of deportation as the accused was caught in portugal for using forged travel documents
5716608 russians have finally agreed to supply specifications of the t 90 tank barrels by end of this year

5716610 campaign manager rick davis asked sunday for a meeting with steve capus the president of nbc news to protest what the campaign called signs that the network is abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race
5716611 in this case the campaign is objecting to a statement by nbcs andrea mitchell on meet the press questioning whether mccain might have gotten a heads up on some of the questions that were asked of sen

5716627 god whispers to us in our pleasures speaks in our conscience but shouts in our pains it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world
5716628 see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
5716629 its worse than four years ago because this time we really thought we would win
5716630 winter sports are popular in russia and our sportsmen have won many competitions and have made a big contribution to the olympic movement
5716631 but we have never won the honour to celebrate the winter olympic games
5716632 you know we can turn sports competitions into a really spectacular show and we are good at it
5716633 our view is that it is highly unlikely that there will be three european olympic games in succession
5716634 russian citizens are proud that russia came to the defense of the weaker one that it came to the defense of its compatriots that it stopped bloodshed
5716635 georgian president mikhail saakashvili went too far when georgia attacked at night and when peaceful civilians died
5716636 they perceive it as the lesser of the two evils
5716637 georgia with all its sins and it has big ones did not attack russia wrote moscow blogger alexander samarzev
5716638 and calls to completely destroy it which have been voiced here are fascist calls
5716639 for most small service providers it is too expensive to run their own 24 7 data centers using parallels automation we are able to offer integrated exchange 2007 at attractive price points

5716647 we try to keep things in perspective game by game
5716648 it was exactly what we needed to be in the running for a medal
5716649 the greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated
5716650 it is getting tougher and tougher to predict winning a medal in track and field individual events our only hope is in the relays and if we do not get our acts together it is going to by very tough
5716651 i watched the ethiopian girl tirunesh dibaba win the 10 000 meter race and my conclusion is that we should start focusing on what we know best i have always opposed spending millions of naira on sponsorship of marathons we should immediately set up training camps for sprints jumps and throws in preparation for 2012 olympics corporate bodies pumping money into marathon sponsorships can get the desired publicity by branding the young athletes that will come out of the camps we can also use part of the money from national lottery

5716669 we have a system that works in my judgment replacing it will perhaps not be that good
5716670 so that they would not be in the firm any more
5716671 i can tell you that the results and feedback ive received of the appointments made by this government have been very very positive
5716672 the moment has come for me to end my career the major reasons for that are my injuries
5716673 im waiting on results talk to me again in 7 weeks
5716674 since the government has been insensitive to our long pending demands we are constrained to go on strike

5716684 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5716685 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5716686 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5716687 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5716688 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5716689 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5716690 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5716691 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5716692 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5716693 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5716694 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5716695 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5716696 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5716697 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5716700 shes obviously got a very good body shes big shes mobile she had to go against some tough competition tonight in players like lisa leslie tina thompson those are probably going to go down as two of the best players to ever play the game i think she held her own obviously she had a tough time here and there but for the most part she did really well i think shes going to bring a lot to uconn
5716701 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks

5716704 the central tenet of our dont buy aig argument is simple the intricacies of aigs business are so complex that management may not even know the extent of the companys ultimate exposures let alone losses
5716705 specifically we foresee 9 billion to 20 billion in economic losses from the cds book which could result in larger cash outlays resulting in a significant shift in the risk quality of aigs assets forcing rating agencies downgrades and resulting in large scale capital raises
5716706 its a win win win win situation for the university of kentucky university of tennessee the tobacco industry and growers
5716707 theres a lot of regional interaction between kentucky and tennessee ive worked with the kentucky tobacco specialists for the past five years as the tobacco specialist for the university of tennessee
5716708 the collaboration has certainly helped us meet the needs of more farmers
5716709 it allows us to serve our geographical regions better it also has enabled our specialists to have a more defined area and allowed them to focus on a specific set of crops
5716710 the collaboration has allowed us to deal with issues in both states and created access to research facilities in both states
5716711 dark tobacco has seen an 18 to 20 percent increase in acreage since the buyout which is the exact opposite of burley
5716712 with the buyout we lost growers but gained acreage so we have fewer barns that are curing more tobacco

5716721 in an independent survey conducted in may 2008 by probe research inc canadians said they are not choosing bottled water over municipal tap water
5716722 what should be of particular concern to the city of london is that the probe study also indicated that about 60 per cent of bottled water drinkers said they will revert to less healthy alternatives found in plastic beverage containers if bottled water isnt available
5716723 the city had an opportunity to expand recycling outside the home but instead it ignored the facts and decided to target a healthy consumer choice
5716724 this is a move that will cost taxpayers more and do less for the environment
5716725 there seems to be a continual erosion of the opportunity for business to do business

5716733 they were in a lot of difficulty it was quite rough seas with gale force winds and the problem was exacerbated from our point of view with the lack of communication with the crew because they cannot speak english
5716734 its good for cbc radio to be playing a variety of musical genres
5716735 but this is a radical change it is moving away from something only the public broadcaster can do to something many private broadcasters already do and they are shoving classical music into the 10 a m to 3 p m low audience ghetto
5716736 the canadian public broadcaster has a responsibility to transmit world classical culture to new generations of canadians
5716737 they are substantially moving away from that responsibility they falsely assume that world classical culture is not something that can be marketed to appeal to younger audiences
5716738 the games have provided us with compelling stories and canadas performances have played out well
5716739 speak to not only the excitement of the games but the standard of our coverage
5716740 jake wetzel didnt make it out obviously we were saying yesterday gordie howes dad came from wisconsin up to saskatoon so there was a little connection there were missing you jake

5716742 im not going to pick a favourite anybody can win
5716743 both of these the 2006 and 2008 games are test cases for us
5716744 obviously this is an important investment as an olympic partner
5716745 and again its not just the exclusive cbc highlights its all the other ancillary pieces
5716746 first of all to understand the technology and what can actually be done and again to try and get a taste through this as to how many people use this technology and will continue to use it
5716747 its giving the audience a chance to watch the way they want to watch
5716748 the third would have been even better but i cant be greedy i was delighted
5716749 overall the team are happy with getting three points on the board at home considering the last two results that the boys have had
5716750 i think overall the whole performance was impressive and the midfield worked very hard and won every second ball
5716751 me and nathan elder both got on the score sheet weve tried to feed off each other as much as we can
5716752 its looking promising in that department but were not going to get carried away because weve got players like alan connell and moses ademola coming off the bench ready to take our shirt if were not doing the business
5716753 if you havent got that competition for places then you might become a little bit complacent youve got to be on it every single game and if youre not there are people waiting in the wings to take your shirt

5716770 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way
5716771 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5716772 evil does exist i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely now the one thing that i think is very important is for to us have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
5716773 in the name of good and i think you know one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that just because we think that our intentions are good doesnt always mean that were going to be doing good
5716774 look the heres how i think about it heres how i think about it yes well depending

5716777 arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5716797 i think theres a legitimate indictment of the church today its that were subcultural rather than countercultural a subculture sociologically speaking buys into the vast majority of the values of the surrounding society but tacks on its own things we dont challenge the materialism of our culture we dont challenge the self indulgence in our culture

5716813 based upon retinal physicians feedback there remains a significant unmet medical need for a treatment for wet amd that can reliably improve visual acuity over time without the need for monthly intravitreal injections
5716814 we are excited about these study findings and the potential for vegf trap eye to fulfill this need pending the results of our ongoing phase 3 clinical studies
5716815 the 52 week results underline that vegf trap eye has the potential to significantly reduce retinal thickness and improve vision
5716816 the further development of this compound is important for millions of people worldwide who suffer from this devastating ocular disease
5716817 for public health reasons we remain concerned about the abuse of prescription drugs and any associated addiction overdose or deaths
5716818 our goals are to encourage physicians to treat legitimate chronic pain and to discourage recreational drug abuse i believe this updated analysis provides further evidence of the potential for remoxy to achieve these goals
5716819 the results of these studies further substantiate remoxys potential as a useful solution that may offer a new standard in chronic pain management
5716820 king is committed to developing uniquely designed medicines such as remoxy that not only meet the needs of chronic pain patients but also help address the problem of prescription drug abuse and misuse including use with alcohol which is currently threatening our communities

5716826 is that even the so called natural approaches to the treatment of yeast infection that are aimed at curing yeast infection from within are either unrealistic impractical and often pricey or they are just the same one dimensional gimmick cures disguised as holistic solutions
5716827 there is simply no other way but the holistic way
5716828 the yeast infection no more program was born out of these necessities
5716829 i have battled with severe yeast infection for the last nine years a month and a half ago i stumbled across your yeast infection no more program over 3 week period i have seen an improvement that i had never experienced with any other conventional or so called natural treatment the fatigue muscle pains non stop itching and rashes have completely disappeared my skin looks significantly better and i slowly got rid of the psoriasis on my right elbow that i had for years
5716830 but i sure am proud to have created a program that truly helps other candida infection sufferers to end their physical and emotional pain and agony for good and gain their life back
5716831 i will be your own personal coach take you by the hand and lead you through the lousy advice marketing hype fads and gimmicks

5716836 we have to bring energy the states are just going to want to push the ball out and get dunks and get easy baskets
5716837 there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry to a complement the clean energy future
5716838 but it is not likely to be developed until we have the major political parties supportive of it
5716839 we remain open to having discussions with the government if it chooses to change its position on nuclear power but until such time as it does i dont see that its likely to happen
5716840 we cannot envisage any circumstances under which australia will have a nuclear power industry
5716841 australia has an abundance of renewable energy sources we have a lot of solar we have a lot of wind we have geothermal resources
5716842 less restrictive conditions could soon be called for otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase
5716843 on these considerations a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate
5716844 if that occurred the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater

5716850 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
5716851 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting
5716852 trinity mirror midlands aims to have two core publishing centres one in birmingham one in coventry backed up by a network of stand alone weekly newspapers capable of contributing profitably to regional performance
5716853 the titles in northampton and long eaton unfortunately do not meet this criteria and regrettably we have taken the decision to close them or to seek a sale
5716854 i would suggest that these things are readily affordable and mr rudd needs to reorganise his own priorities if he wants to keep the bottom line the same
5716855 at least before when we were buying our premixed drinks we knew how much alcohol content there was

5716870 up to 2 4 percent of the u s population self identifies as mixed race and most of these individuals describe themselves as biracial
5716871 we cannot underestimate the importance of understanding the social psychological and experiential differences that may increase the likelihood of psychological disorders among this fast growing segment of the population
5716872 yeast express a protein called hsp104 which is able to reverse protein aggregation
5716873 however for reasons that are unclear hsp104 is not found in mammals we wondered if introducing hsp104 into mammals could help with diseases connected with protein aggregation
5716874 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5716875 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children even in a leisure based situation such as playing video games
5716876 the big picture is that there are several dimensions on which games have effects including the amount they are played the content of each game what you have to pay attention to on the screen and how you control the motions
5716877 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could

5716941 a printable calendar is not one of those things that id expect to have the full power of an online web calendar system
5716942 so i was excited when i saw the free printable calendar from keepandshare my sister is coming over to try it out with me
5716943 ill put up a pot of coffee and well sit down together with the idea of trying printable calendars our for church and school applications my colleague is using the printable calendar for weekly lesson planning

5716945 its so easy to pick which months to print or choose to print an entire year at a time
5716946 and i figured a printable calendar could be useful for all those times you need to create schedules for organizations to hand out at meetings
5716947 printable calendars are a fast growing web category and we hope to continue to be a top ranked leader

5716988 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5716989 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5716990 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5716991 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5716992 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5716993 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5716994 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5716995 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5716996 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5716997 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5716998 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5716999 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5717000 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5717001 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5717002 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5717003 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5717004 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5717059 what worship is and is not i am tempted to copy out the whole chapter for you to read it feels that important to me its an eye opener its light along a dark road its a map to a place we thought we were going but we ended up the wrong place never realizing we were lost here are a few lines for you to chew on
5717060 one of the problems with worship is that it has become a word used for many things that are not really worship i see at least four false models of worship the first three can operate either corporately or individually the first false model is that of the classroom it views worship as learning in either our private devotionals or church gathering we evaluate what goes on by how much knowledge we acquire church becomes a lecture hall and personal study becomes gods homework study is vital but it is not worship what study should be is prelude to worship knowledge of god leads to worship and further study should give birth to even more fervent and meaningful worship the second false model is that of the evangelistic tent it regards corporate religious service as a place of proclamation that invites sinners to accept jesus private devotions are to convert or perhaps prepare one to share their faith with others again evangelism itself is not wrong but it is not worship rather evangelism should be the result of worship meeting god in worship should inspire and empower us to invite others into the joy of worship the third false model is that of the psychologists couch the sermon is a kind of mass counseling and private prayer is do it yourself therapy
5717061 the fourth false model is that of a spectator sport for many corporate worship is watching the professionals perform we evaluate them if they do well we cheer and if they do poorly we criticize our place in corporate worship is to be a participant not a spectator

5717271 lawfully existed prior to enactment of a zoning ordinance and which is maintained after the effective date of the ordinance although it does not comply with the use restrictions applicable to the area
5717272 5 the lawful use of any building structure or land at the time of the enactment or amendment of any zoning ordinance or regulation may be continued
5717273 7 a any use described in subsection 5 of this section may not be resumed after a period of interruption or abandonment unless the resumed use conforms with the requirements of zoning ordinances or regulations applicable at the time of the proposed resumption
5717274 in determining whether to approve a proposed use of property as an alteration of a nonconforming use where the local government has not previously determined that a nonconforming use exists there are generally four inquiries that the local government must make first did the use lawfully exist at the time the zoning which first made the use unlawful was applied second what was the nature and extent of the use at the time it became nonconforming third if the use lawfully existed at the time restrictive zoning was applied has the use been discontinued or abandoned such that the right to continue the use or that part of the use as a nonconforming use was lost fourth to the extent the proposed use constitutes an alteration of the lawfully established nonconforming use structure or physical improvements does that alteration comply with the standards governing alteration of nonconforming uses
5717275 dwelling unit or units accessory to an active commercial use located above the first story
5717276 a s intervenors note the premise to petitioners argument is that the d welling unit or units accessory to an active commercial use permitted under tcluo 3 312 2 i may only be occupied by the owner or employees of the commercial use the board adopted an interpretation to the contrary petitioners do not acknowledge that interpretation or explain why it is reversible under the somewhat deferential standard of review we must apply to a governing bodys interpretation of a local land use regulation ors 197 829 1 church v grant county 187 or app 518 524 69 p3d 759 2003 we do not see that the boards interpretation is inconsistent with the text or context of tcluo 3 312 2 i
5717277 structure or use that legally exists at the time this ordinance becomes effective but which does not conform to the current requirements of the zone in which it is located
5717278 purpose for which a unit of land is developed occupied or maintained
5717279 then the alteration shall be subject to major review under section 7 020 12
5717280 in accepting the case back on remand the planning commission first determined that the minor review process was the applicable process for this case
5717281 the board of commissioners remanded the case to planning commission and the planning commission made a final appealable order on that issue that order was not appealed tcluo 10 030 3 states that a n action or ruling of the commission pursuant to this ordinance may be appealed to the board within 12 days after the departments notification of the commissions actions to the applicant this provision further states that if an appeal is not timely filed the commissions decision shall be final id the board determines that the planning commissions decision became final by virtue of the fact that no timely appeal was filed by either party the failure to file an appeal is a jurisdictional defect and so the board of commissioners never obtained jurisdiction over this issue and must accept the planning commissions decision on this point as final
5717282 counsel for petitioners did not receive notice of the hearing or decision no evidence was heard at the hearing and appeal of the minor review element was not required as it represented only one portion of the countys consideration of the building permit decision the decision that is now on appeal
5717283 in our view where the local code makes available an appeal of a lower bodys decision to a higher local decision maker the ors 197 825 2 a exhaustion principle requires that a petitioner exhaust that available local remedy even if the lower bodys decision is part of a larger multi step and procedurally complex proceeding as in the present case as a corollary the petitioner cannot instead of filing a local appeal of that lower bodys decision attempt to challenge the decision in an appeal of a later related decision in that larger multi step proceeding accordingly we agree with the county and intervenor that we lack jurisdiction to address petitioners challenges to the may 18 2006 order and the board did not err in concluding that petitioners failure to appeal the planning commissions may 18 2006 decision precludes petitioners from challenging that decision before the board
5717284 will have no greater adverse impact on neighboring areas than the existing use or structure when the current zoning went into effect
5717285 if luba does not err in the articulation of its substantial evidence standard of review under ors 197 835 9 a c we would reverse lubas decision only when there is no evidence to support the finding or if the evidence in the case is so at odds with lubas evaluation that a reviewing court could infer that luba had misunderstood or misapplied its scope of review younger v city of portland 305 or 346 359 752 p2d 262 1988

5717419 we saw really good football out there today not least as gladbach also played in an attacking vein although at 3 0 it was essentially all over
5717420 i am pleased with my team that we are so good in form we played well and got the ball forward quickly
5717421 i hope we can continue this way but we have just won the first game its a big step and an important one but we mustnt forget its a long season and we cant underestimate any team
5717422 we are still in the early phase and at the moment we are not in a position to put an opponent under pressure

5717426 the only negative thing was that we gave away a 2 0 lead

5717447 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5717448 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5717449 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5717450 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5717451 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5717452 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones

5717456 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5717457 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5717458 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5717459 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5717460 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5717461 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5717462 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge

5717550 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country

5717553 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
5717554 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
5717555 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest

5717557 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

5717569 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
5717570 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
5717571 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
5717572 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
5717573 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
5717574 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
5717575 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent

5717579 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress

5717592 the credit environment continues to be difficult exacerbated by a slowdown in execution and origination
5717593 we believe the management wants to leave its mortgage troubles behind and restore confidence which it can best accomplish by reducing its higher risk credit exposure
5717594 lehman may now look to sell its asset management business including neuberger berman if it is forced to raise additional capital
5717595 because the asset management business continues to perform well lehman could likely find a buyer for the business at a reasonable price which would be a far less dilutive option in comparison with selling new equity today
5717596 that said lehman would be losing a stable revenue generating business if it goes this route
5717597 there have been numerous comments in the press about a potential sale of lehmans asset management arm
5717598 we dont think the investors and rating agencies would welcome this divestiture which brings a steady cash flow diversification and a lower compensation ratio
5717599 one of the biggest takeaways on the strategic front was that if additional capital is needed at lehman selling neuberger is not a viable option
5717600 it is too integral to the franchise it provides a steadier stream of revenues relative to some of lehmans other businesses and as we have pointed out in the past it is also well received by the rating agencies
5717601 and until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflation pressures
5717602 the tailwind that was holding labor costs at home hostage to the threat of outsourcing production in china has been significantly mitigated

5717620 it offers a new channel for the protesters to better express their opinions by attracting the attention of tourists reporters and officials during the games
5717621 it was in violation of chinas law on demonstrations and protests
5717622 the move to set aside protest areas is in line with beijings promises to the international olympic committee to adhere to the olympic traditions such as free expression outside the sporting venues

5717630 i know what they pakistanis feel about the emergency when all these suicide bombings were taking place their view is why have i done it so late
5717631 considered purely in military terms the kargil operations were a landmark in the history of the pakistani army
5717632 each and every individual pakistani was in favour of his winning each and every one i dont think there could be a single pakistani who was against him i would say he enjoyed the support of every pakistani
5717633 benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif will not participate in 2007 elections
5717634 i am one hundred percent sure they would lose elections against me even if their votes were combined

5717643 when the a d a was enacted in 1992 it led to a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers how could this be employers concerned that they wouldnt be able to discipline or fire disabled workers who happened to be incompetent apparently avoided hiring them in the first place
5717644 i always considered my friends to be pretty metropolitan but they too seemed to have problems coming to terms with it
5717645 they thought i was joking eventually i had to show them my new bank cards to get them to believe me they kept asking why people seemed vaguely disapproving as if we were breaking a sacred rule
5717646 we connect people with learning opportunities and creative ideas from the uk and aim to build lasting relationships around the world
5717647 what is most disappointing to me is that the british people working there while they may have been busy or on their lunchbreaks none of them were capable of acknowledging me of even just saying
5717648 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5717649 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5717650 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition
5717651 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5717652 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue
5717653 we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5717654 drunk driving used to be a part of american culture until someone stood up and said we need to make a change and 25 years later designated driver is a commonplace term in every household in america
5717655 it gives me great pause to think of sending thousands of students onto a campus where the person who is most accountable doesnt seem to be devoted to ensuring their health and safety
5717656 if they drink too much in the beginning of an evening they can get alcohol poisoning
5717657 theyre really not aware of how their judgment is impaired we hope they dont get into a car or if theyre a young woman go to a fraternity party its just not healthy
5717658 a lot of young people feel that they are afraid of enforcement
5717659 they tend to get in a car and go someplace else and thats very very dangerous i worry about it every weekend
5717660 i think alcohol is seen a lot of times as a forbidden thing and people want it
5717661 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it
5717662 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5717663 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5717664 lets debate the age and look at the pros and cons
5717665 i really think weve got to somehow be able to control it better because what we have done now is driven it underground and we cant do anything about it
5717666 there are a lot of things we could do if it wasnt underground

5717676 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself

5717892 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
5717893 we believe that 95 percent is the minimally acceptable probability of success for a given initial withdrawal rate
5717894 i dont think i played a game healthy last season i was probably at 50 or 60 so theres a lot more to come
5717895 i just think at this place i can improve and i dont think ive nearly fulfilled my potential yet
5717896 id like to be fit as soon as possible with the manchester united games coming up and obviously the england qualifiers are big games for us
5717897 im working on my fitness every day doing as much as i can training hard and hopefully ill be fit very very soon
5717898 you need to play well thats the most important thing if youre not going to play well it doesnt matter where you play
5717899 the standards are very high here and with england and they were with bayern munich as well
5717900 youll miss a lot of action waiting for gdp to go negative more to the point if youre waiting as an investor for gdp to actually turn negative youre going to miss a lot of action along the way i think the best example is to just go back to japan they had a real estate bubble that turned bust and they had their own credit contraction back in the early 1990s guess what japan didnt post its first back to back contraction of real gdp until the second half of 1993 by the time the back to back negative that people seem to be waiting for happened the nikkei had already plunged 50 the 10 year jgb yield rallied 300 basis points and the bank of japan had cut the overnight rate 500 basis points which said a thing or two about the efficacy of using the traditional monetary policy response of cutting interest rates into a credit contraction as were now finding out here in the us
5717901 the point is we cant make the assumption that weve avoided a recessionary condition in the economy just because we have so far managed to avoid back to back quarters of negative gdp
5717902 the nber relies on four different variables the first is employment now ive told you before employment is down seven months in a row does employment go in the gdp the answer is no is it correlated yes does it help grow the business cycle of course
5717903 the next variable is industrial production does that go into gdp the answer is no does it help grow the business cycle the answer is yes this is a number that comes from the fed the gdp comes from the commerce department its a very important variable
5717904 the next variable the third one is real personal income excluding government transfers
5717905 the fourth variable and the only variable that actually feeds into gdp is real sales activity in manufacturing retail and wholesale sectors
5717906 opening the door of the political process to people who have never taken part in the past has been the bedrock of our planning for this convention since we arrived in denver one year ago
5717907 twelve months and 56 primaries and caucuses later its only fitting that our delegates represent that same core value and barack obamas unparalleled ability to bring more new people in to the electoral process than ever before young and old first timers and convention veterans all representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds and communities this is a delegation that will bring americas voices to denver
5717908 in just days delegates will come together in denver to conduct the most important business of the convention nominating barack obama as our partys nominee for the next president of the united states
5717909 as we gather in denver to change the course of our nation we will truly represent the strength and diversity of our party and our country
5717910 for our veterans living in rural areas the nearest medical center can be miles away
5717911 vas commitment is to provide the best quality care to veterans regardless of their address these centers are a major step toward ensuring that commitment is met
5717912 va has always been committed to providing quality care to rural veterans
5717913 these centers will allow us to better identify and meet the unique needs of our rural veterans as their population continues to grow

5717936 by all criteria of modern molecular biology life is present from the moment of conception
5717937 it is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception

5717943 most potential routes of infection are controlled through current procedures
5717944 however the outbreak in suffolk appears to be the outcome of a series of normally low probability events and circumstances which cumulatively led to the introduction of disease
5717945 although we cannot be sure how the outbreak happened this episode reflects the need for constant vigilance high levels of biosecurity and robust and well developed contingency planning in dealing with animal disease outbreaks
5717946 of course well look for an opportunity to debate this and all of us are uncomfortable about the reports of high levels of compensation paid to mr matthews firm
5717947 things are panning out as expected with more people being laid off but there are signs the situation is bottoming out with recovery happening slowly
5717948 we see things getting better over the next few weeks
5717949 because of recent events i realise that you need to hear from me
5717950 bird keepers should continue to practice good biosecurity and remain vigilant for signs of disease
5717951 the fact that we have no evidence of this disease spreading outside of the infected premise is a testament to our emergency response planning and implementation
5717952 this meat was from birds slaughtered prior to 2 february
5717953 porque no he conocido ning n argumento jur dico ni pol tico serio en contra que nos haya dicho por qu se debe prohibir que la sociedad vasca sea consultada

5717960 theyre condemning the catholic church as hateful and harmful and that is clearly a violation of constitutional law where no government entity is to be hostile to any particular religion
5717961 so many times were told the church needs to butt out of the state
5717962 but here we have a perfect situation of what the first amendment is addressing
5717963 our goal is that they dont do this again that they learn to step back and not overstep their authority
5717964 were reading a lot about the candidates and the media this election season but what are they reading
5717965 now you can track the news sites and blogs barack obama and john mccain read from drudge to the daily show and follow articles catching the eyes of leading political journalists
5717966 we convey our sincere appreciation to the aaa foundation for the kind gesture
5717967 egs could be the killer app of the energy world it has the potential to deliver vast quantities of power 24 7 and be captured nearly anywhere on the planet and it would be a perfect complement to intermittent sources like solar and wind
5717968 innovation is the path to massive quantities of cleaner cheaper energy the people were funding today have a real shot at lowering the cost of egs and bringing us closer to our goal of renewable energy cheaper than coal
5717969 egs is critical to the clean electricity revolution we need to solve the climate crisis but egs hasnt received the attention it merits thats why were pressing for expanded support from government and increased investment from the private sector

5717980 the struggling sales market has fuelled a mini boom in lettings but we are now starting to see rents dip across the board as the number of new tenants coming to the market levels off
5717981 to prosper in the current conditions landlords must have realistic expectations regarding rental income and steer clear of void periods at all costs
5717982 a number of accidental landlords who have come to the market reluctantly after failing to sell their property are refusing to budge at all on the asking rent instead settling for void periods which professional landlords know are seriously detrimental to yields
5717983 the disease had features that were not seen before and fortunately have not been seen since
5717984 it is only a matter of a few hours until death comes and it is simply a struggle for air until they suffocate

5718037 to the extent that we think the internet economy is a major source of value creating activity in the u s economy and a major source of social experience for lots of americans it seems to me really critical that the president understand what thats about
5718038 the president should come from a technology background and understand technology at a high level
5718039 it would be good if the person at the helm of the country had an appreciation of the changes taking place as we speak
5718040 is it more complex than a nuclear power plant hardly
5718041 anything to do with technology becomes a distraction at some level
5718042 i dont think were going to find him on facebook or chatrooms
5718043 a mechanical problem is not always solved by a mechanical widget
5718044 his desire to deal with the problem will be motivated by his experience with the box
5718045 the fact that they maintain and secure the it infrastructure is ten times more important than anything you do
5718046 its not so much the use of it but theres a level of familiarity theres a sense of what it means for this amount of information about peoples interconnections to be out there
5718047 if the president himself is not tech savvy there will be someone who will be in effect the person calling the shots on these issues of where technology meets public policy and that i think would be pretty scary

5718097 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5718098 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5718099 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5718100 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5718101 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5718102 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5718103 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5718104 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5718105 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5718106 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5718107 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5718108 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5718109 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5718110 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5718111 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5718112 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5718113 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5718114 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5718115 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5718116 you have the freedom to stop using the currency and use other methods of payment
5718117 what if you could have your own panty raid with horny sex starved college girls

5718119 i shall go to him but he will not return to me
5718120 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5718121 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5718122 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5718123 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5718124 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5718125 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5718126 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5718127 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5718128 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5718129 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5718130 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5718131 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5718132 no i picked it up from the driveway before i left
5718133 well look at the paper it will tell you what day it is
5718134 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5718135 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5718136 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5718137 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5718138 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5718139 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5718140 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5718141 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5718142 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5718143 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5718144 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5718145 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5718146 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5718147 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5718148 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5718149 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5718150 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5718151 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5718152 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5718153 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5718154 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5718155 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5718156 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5718157 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5718158 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5718159 military men will not vouchsafe to use our ancient terms belonging to matters of war but do call a camp by the dutch name
5718160 growing our direct business working with suppliers and developing our relationships within the book trade and internet arenas
5718161 the primary focus for the next three to four months will be on getting a new commercial website up and running for the uk and us
5718162 i think this is a fantastic opportunity the book depositorys focus on delivering real availability within the long tail of titles and their solid growth means that with extra resource we can help grow the business even further
5718163 these stories and the accompanying pages for a novel in progress are exhilarating unflinching in their portrait of a country and people in torment yet full of spirit humour and humanity
5718164 this above case is just another russian symptom a sick corrupted society that offers no real legal protection the country is nothing short of a banana republic not very different from some western african countries
5718165 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5718166 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5718167 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5718168 because they are fairly equally divided among ideologies and between the two predominate political parties the
5718169 not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
5718170 i want people throughout the country to know the barack obama i know
5718171 instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5718172 he can run that kind of campaign but i believe the american people are better than that
5718173 its a reflection of life anything can happen favorites dont always win but my olympic dream came true when i crossed that line
5718174 thank you for your support as our valued customer we have specially selected
5718175 ive been having a very sexual online relationship with a man halfway across the country for a year and a half we have met in person once as well it did include some sexual contact previously i was very intensely into this man and was devastated when i found he lied about crucial things like the fact he has a child im no longer as emotionally invested in him as i have a local boyfriend now but we continue to interact online and by text message with very sexual banter very regularly we have sexual chats and he sends me unsolicited pictures of himself naked my boyfriend knows about this guy and doesnt mind however i just found out by google no less that this guy is getting married in less than a month i feel the extreme need to contact his fianc and let her know i feel like if i just cut off contact shell never know what kind of man she is marrying if i were her id want to have all the information if i just confront him and tell him to be honest with her theres no way to know if he actually tells her or not and considering his past hed probably lie to her what do i do
5718176 i would absolutely want to know if my future husband was a pathologically lying piece of crap

5718211 oh holy prophetess anna you endured my greatest of fears yet through the grace of god were not crushed and beat down ever thereafter please pray to christ that i might take courage in your resilience and trust with all my soul in the wisdom of his plans
5718212 st anna i am tired so very drained from fighting impulses to lie down and rest to wallow in self pity teach me by your example how to weather the tumultuousness of my passions until at last i find the peace achieved through sacrifice
5718213 i need words and motivation i want to share with others what ive experienced through the church in terms of clarity mercy and a sense of purpose

5718215 this happened in the days of king xerxes who reigned over 127 provinces stretching from india to ethiopia at that time he ruled his empire from his throne at the fortress of susa
5718216 for this is what the lord himself said and i pass it on to you just as i received it
5718217 this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me
5718218 this cup is the new covenant between god and you sealed by the shedding of my blood do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it
5718219 so if anyone eats this bread or drinks this cup of the lord unworthily that person is guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the lord that is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking from the cup for if you eat the bread or drink the cup unworthily not honoring the body of christ you are eating and drinking gods judgment upon yourself
5718220 o lord you know all about this do not stay silent dont abandon me now o lord wake up rise to my defense take up my case my god and my lord
5718221 the wise have wealth and luxury but fools spend whatever they get
5718222 and who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this
5718223 now there are different kinds of spiritual gifts but it is the same holy spirit who is the source of them all there are different kinds of service in the church but it is the same lord we are serving there are different ways god works in our lives but it is the same god who does the work through all of us a spiritual gift is given to each of us as a means of helping the entire church
5718224 if one part suffers all the parts suffer with it and if one part is honored all the parts are glad
5718225 if we are the body why arent his hands healing why is his love not showing them there is a way
5718226 sin whispers to the wicked deep within their hearts they have no fear of god to restrain them
5718227 your unfailing love o lord is as vast as the heavens your faithfulness reaches beyond the clouds your righteousness is like the mighty mountains your justice like the ocean depths
5718228 for you are the fountain of life the light by which we see
5718229 whoever pursues godliness and unfailing love will find life godliness and honor

5718232 we will come in on budget and we will not waste taxpayers money
5718233 within the overall ceiling of 9 325bn theres no more money
5718234 the budget can not be exceeded because there is no more money
5718235 if we have to find more money for a particular aspect of the programme then savings will have to be effected elsewhere and everybody involved in the programme understands that
5718236 this was a project an olympic games that was won secured commissioned at a time of economic plenty
5718237 were being asked to deliver it in a credit crunch and with what people say is a recession looming the international olympic committee understands that
5718238 were not going to produce an austerity games we are not going to run the thing down but we are going to deliver value for money and im absolutely determined that we are not going to waste taxpayers money
5718239 and that means that over the next few months we will be looking at ways of ensuring we maximise bang for our buck
5718240 does every single thing on the site have to be on the site thats the kind of question well be looking at

5718253 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy
5718254 the next one month will be a key period for the government

5718276 hitler eva braun y 13 jerarcas nazis aterrizaron en barcelona el 27 de abril de 1945 en un vuelo que parti de berl n e hizo escala en linz austria
5718277 viajaron en un junker 290 n mero de serie 0163 c digo pipq que tiempo despu s fue localizado por los aliados en un aeropuerto naval de la localidad de travem nde cercana a hamburgo
5718278 apenas fue un trampol n para el escape de hitler en submarino hacia suram rica
5718279 el documento del fbi fechado en mayo de 1947 cobra valor uniendo todos estos datos hist ricos aunque mi teor a es que hitler estuvo en espa a no m s de un mes y ya hab a abandonado ese pa s cuando el ej rcito estadounidense lo busc all
5718280 los alemanes dejaron cad veres en los b nkers con credenciales de sus jerarcas para que el mundo creyera que se trataba de ellos incluso se utilizaron varios dobles de hitler

5718283 i spoke to him just now and he said everything is ok he is happy to be going home he was in a good mood
5718284 we need to control him and he will be once he returns to this country
5718285 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5718286 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5718287 i have an incomplete album that i want to finish i have been thinking about the plan during my days in jail i have sung rock n roll for 40 years after jail i will rock n roll
5718288 i would hope that the authorities make sure that gary glitter does not slip off to another country
5718289 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5718290 glitter is a persistent offender responsible for a catalogue of sexual crimes against children
5718291 on his return to the uk the authorities must assess the level of risk he poses to children and make sure he is carefully managed and supervised in the community to keep children safe from harm

5718498 valencia ist ein grand prix auf den ich mich nicht nur freue weil es eine neue strecke sondern weil es ein stadtkurs ist
5718499 von dem was ich bisher gesehen und gelesen habe d rfte es eine fantastische strecke sein daher kann ich das wochenende kaum noch erwarten die atmosph re wird auch toll sein denn die spanier sind enthusiastische fans und valencia sollte unserem auto liegen daher hoffe ich auf ein gutes rennen
5718500 unser auto l uft auf solchen strecken gut daher rechne ich mit einer guten performance
5718501 die strecke sieht fantastisch aus es sollte ein interessantes rennen werden
5718502 f r uns fahrer wird es nicht allzu lange dauern bis wir uns an die strecke gew hnt haben und zum ersten mal m ssen alle anderen genau wie ich die strecke erst einmal lernen ich hatte zwei sch ne urlaubswochen war zu hause in japan und habe familie und freunde getroffen aber jetzt freue ich mich schon auf die letzten paar rennen dieser saison
5718503 mit 25 kurven wird es f r die fahrer hart die konzentration zu bewahren
5718504 f r die fahrer wie auch f r die ingenieure
5718505 mit 25 kurven wird es f r die fahrer hart die konzentration zu bewahren und eine perfekte runde hinzubekommen vor allem im qualifying besonders entscheidend wird sein den freitag problemlos abzuwickeln denn die fahrer m ssen sich erst auf die strecke einstellen und der asphalt wird zun chst noch gr n sein
5718506 die autos werden wegen der f nf geraden weniger heckfl gel als sonst fahren und die langgezogenen kurven werden mit vollgas genommen bridgestone wird die soft und supersoftreifen nach valencia bringen die f r stadtkurse geeignet sind
5718507 die teams werden sich h chstwahrscheinlich f r eine ein oder zweistoppstrategie entscheiden weil man auf kurvenreichen kursen meistens schwer berholen kann wir werden aber am freitagabend die im training gesammelten daten hinsichtlich reifenverschlei und benzinverbrauch analysieren
5718508 these firms offer to buy the shares at an attractive price but demand an advance fee
5718509 this is a scam as soon as the fee is paid the firm disappears with the money and without purchasing the shares
5718510 i am a bit speechless but i am very happy and overwhelmed super duper
5718511 i did the best i could equalled my pb and got a silver medal
5718512 i was a bit nervous but the crowd were amazing they gave me energy and i did it i most definitely exceeded expectations my coach believed in me more than i believed in myself which is good you need a coach that is positive
5718513 i went way above my limits tonight personal best and silver medal
5718514 you never think its a reality its something you dream about as i came across the line i thought oh my gosh i dont know what to say
5718515 es una de las peores decisiones que yo considero se ha dado en este pa s sto va en contra de la doctrina del estado de derecho
5718516 la moci n de reconsideraci n de justicia revela con claridad que cualquiera puede ver irregularidades fraude y la grave falta en el tr mite de permisos le se ala con respeto y dignidad que hern ndez denton se excedi en su jurisdicci n viol sus propias doctrinas porque resolvieron cosas que no estaban ante su consideraci n
5718517 could already be the single most ubiquitous figure on television today measured purely in face time
5718518 its a dream come true its everything ive trained for over the last two years ive dedicated so much of my life to getting a medal just to get here at all was unbelievable all those cold morning runs have paid off now
5718519 jeffries said to me after the fight that i was a lot better than he thought i was which was cheeky thing to say but its something ill remember believe me
5718520 there was a lot of talk but the team never felt down we stuck together and this is a great success not only for beijing but for london with so many of these guys intending to stay around for 2012
5718521 since seeing audley harrison winning the olympics ive never been that interested in turning professional
5718522 hopefully my funding will increase now for the 2012 olympics and i wont have to do that again
5718523 ive had my ups and downs and a couple of years ago i was on a bit of a down
5718524 as student finance now offers considerably more than repayable loans such as grants and bursaries people should make sure they dont miss out on available funding that they wont have to repay and should seek out all the detailed information on the various websites
5718525 look for the account that offers the cheapest overdraft and the lowest fees the one that makes the most financial sense
5718526 when youre preparing to go to uni freshers week moving in and meeting new friends is higher on the list than finance
5718527 however if you can spend a bit of time thinking about your budget before you go it will make such a difference later on housing will be the biggest cost but students always tell us that they are amazed how socialising and shopping costs really build up over the year
5718528 that means religulous is probably playing in some out of the way theatre in the manhattan area also
5718529 ive got nothing for you on the vp sweepstakes anything in that regard ought to be directed to the mccain campaign
5718530 i dont talk about the vp stuff because i think its mostly speculation and i just have stopped talking about it

5718534 john mccains outrageous position that the western water compact should be renegotiated will set off a wave criticism that will come crashing down on his hopes to carry colorado and new mexico
5718535 his position threatens to start a new water war at a time when the seven states of the compact have recently agreed to and are implementing an allocation agreement in peace and harmony the people of colorado and new mexico have every reason to be outraged
5718536 in the west whisky is for drinking water is for fighting
5718537 its bad enough that john mccain represents four more years of failed bush policies
5718538 he has no plan for solving the energy crisis he wants to dismantle the successful social security program and he thinks it would be okay to spend 100 years in iraq while terrorists reorganize in afghanistan we agree to disagree on many issues however mr mccain has lost his marbles if he thinks well let him gamble away our water
5718539 whether mccain was being serious or glib his economic policies prioritize and profit corporate interests over regular coloradans
5718540 our country needs a new vision and dramatic change not more of the same
5718541 under a mccain administration youd have a president who says were better off today than we were eight years ago and who thinks hes helping the middle class when he gives tax breaks to people making almost 5 million and youd have treasury secretary who thinks we should all stop imagining that families are up against tough times

5718545 i am acutely concerned about our african american students african american students as a whole scored in english language arts just one point above latino students a subgroup that includes a significant number of english learners this coupled with an alarming dropout rate among african americans indicates a crisis in the education of black children

5718552 it shouldnt surprise us that anticipating the difficulties family oriented employees have in juggling work and home is a potential deterrent for employers and a source of discrimination in labour markets

5718586 it was a hard play at the plate where we lost our starting catcher
5718587 just hard baseball thats all but i thought the other slide by schierholtz was too high in the states you try to do that youre ejected he ejected me from the game and the umpire let the game get away thats all there was to it
5718588 i figured thered be a play and he blocked the plate so i did what i had to do to score the run
5718589 it was a close game at the time and weve been playing close games so i knew we needed the run i wasnt trying to take him out
5718590 my left shoulders still bad from having to run over catchers that were in front of home plate

5718618 im sorry but if youd like to have surgery youre going to have to be seeing a therapist on a weekly basis especially as you adjust to your new dietary regimen

5718630 you could hear her going on and on because she was standing right behind the stage curtain
5718631 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5718632 she leaves us waiting and everyone is sitting there complaining and then she comes out and doesnt say a word about it she didnt even say hello she got right into her script
5718633 tyra kept saying when i was a model and would hardly let them talk
5718634 it must be remembered in this connection however that any sort of influence exerted by an employer upon an employee dependent upon his employment for means of livelihood may very easily become undue in that it will coerce the employees will in favor of what the employer desires against his better judgment as to what is really in the best interest of himself and his fellow employees one purpose of labor law was to insure free and untrammeled action on the part of the employees in the choice of their representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining and it is a violation of the terms as well as the spirit of the act for the employer to address arguments to the employee couched in such terms or presented in such manner as to lead the employee to fear that he may suffer from the action of the employer if he does not follow the wishes of the latter in making his choice of representatives
5718635 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5718636 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5718637 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5718638 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5718639 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5718640 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5718641 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5718642 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5718643 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5718644 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass

5718659 a tiny woman and two children were laid to rest on a bed of flowers 5 000 years ago in what is now the barren sahara desert

5718661 what he was doing to manuel wasnt right rivera said
5718662 my mother said dont open the door but i was afraid for manuel so i opened the door
5718663 he was hitting him very hard he was screaming and hitting him my mother was crying
5718664 his eyes were all red either from pepper spray or from blood
5718665 what he was doing to manuel wasnt right i wanted other officers to come

5718669 that although the newspapers are carrying the bulk of nra publicity a number of the publishers themselves are planning to cheat nra re employment aims
5718670 the newspaper publishers are toying with the idea of classifying their editorial staffs as professional men since nra regulations do not cover professionals newspaper men therefore would continue in many instances to work all hours of the day and any number of hours of the week
5718671 the average newspaper man probably works on an eight hour a day and six day week basis
5718672 the men who make up the papers of this country would never look upon themselves as what they really are hacks and white collar slaves
5718673 yes and those dopes the printers because of their union are getting on an average some 30 per cent better than the smart fourth estaters and not only that but the printers because of their union and because they dont permit themselves to be called high faluting names will now benefit by the new nra regulations and have a large number of their unemployed re employed while the smart editorial department boys will continue to work forty eight hours a week because they love to hear themselves referred to as professionals and because they consider unionization as lowering their dignity
5718674 oh well after all he used to be a newspaper man once himself
5718675 i believe he will be a great partner to me and the rest of the management team as we focus on ways to improve our business

5718682 i have waited until this moment when i could gather the very best actors including the esteemed to direct this play
5718683 i am honored to have worked with tennessee williams at the williamstown theatre festival earlier in my career and so to direct his landmark play for the first time represents a wonderful and meaningful milestone for me
5718684 out of poetic imagination and ordinary compassion he has spun a poignant and luminous story
5718685 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
5718686 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
5718687 there was no doubt among us teachers that is what he meant we interpreted his words as meaning he would help fund the school either personally or by raising sponsors or both in order to give our school desperately needed modern facilities and a facelift
5718688 when he comes down here he will change the face of the school and believe me our poverty in kogelo will be a thing of the past
5718689 senator obama has not honoured the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
5718690 my mother and sister also had rottweilers they are among the kindest and gentlest dogs and they are great to be around
5718691 i will have no part of banning rottweilers and i am confident that chucks request to ban a certain breed of animal will meet resistance from the public
5718692 whats really sad is that we have some wonderful people who call us and have to give up their dobermans because towns have banned the breed
5718693 these people have a completely well trained socialized pet and the town bans them
5718694 many of these people cant afford to move out of town so they give up their dogs
5718695 i never have any problem with melvin hes the sweetest dog and wouldnt hurt anybody
5718696 if you take a dog to obedience school he or she can be a good member of society to hear rantoul is thinking about banning dobermans is very sad
5718697 it is very unfortunate when a village board does what rantoul is talking about
5718698 this is a knee jerk reaction public officials are punishing responsible people and pets for doing nothing
5718699 drugs make slaves out of people mr douglas is in the slave trade
5718700 it was not my house it was not my drugs i was convicted of something i didnt have anything to do with im a good person
5718701 id like to ban certain breeds and set limits on other breeds
5718702 we need to ban pit bulls rottweilers and doberman pinschers based on the reputations of the animals not the owners
5718703 in order to complete the inspection we had to have the dogs from the basement put in the garage and the dogs in the garage put in the basement
5718704 they werent cleaning up the feces and the mess and werent taking care of the odors
5718705 i have no idea what the woman was doing with 19 pit bulls
5718706 one of the things that is a concern to me is the safety of my inspector
5718707 id like to place a certain limit on the types of dogs that could cause physical damage to the residents of rantoul
5718708 in addition id like a complete ban on certain types of dogs within the city limits
5718709 im hoping this will send a message to people who have multiple dogs that they need to clean up their act
5718710 we could declare a certain breed a dangerous dog without regard to having a previous incident of being involved in a threatening action
5718711 it makes a lot of sense it just means that everything else needs to shift back a few days
5718712 a lot of schools across the country have a weekday move in
5718713 many of them have told us their families mark it on the calendar and its not really such an impact
5718714 we had to find somebody to tell us where the door was today
5718715 im very fortunate to have a job with that flexibility not everyone has that
5718716 for me i would just be there no matter what
5718717 here comes the orator with his flood of words and his drop of reason
5718718 planned parenthood wants to move and enlarge their headquarters and abortion center from an area in southeast portland with a black population of about 1 and place it in the king neighborhood that has a black population of about 43
5718719 portland only has an overall population of about 6 blacks planned parenthood will reduce this number even more with their new facility
5718720 portland development commission the urban renewal agency for the area owns the land and wants to use it to kill babies
5718721 we do not want the city of portland to work with planned parenthood and sell urban renewal land to build a prenatal killing center
5718722 not do anything that would be disruptive to what has been very important to the republican platform
5718723 i think a lot of people not just social conservatives but a lot of the republicans i know are not necessarily comfortable with romney
5718724 but it has nothing to do with religion it has everything to do with inconsistencies in positions hes held and thats it
5718725 the issue is that in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position not just on one or two things but on many of the issues
5718726 i think that there are better choices for sen mccain that will have the approval of values voters
5718727 i have no expectations that im going to get that phone call
5718728 my commitment is to support him and i dont request that he support me in order to get my support
5718729 im glad to hear that michael is pursuing full conservatorship of janet
5718730 michael understands how to handle these difficult medical situations and hes not going to give up fighting for his little sister
5718731 this case shows that so called futile care theory needs to be seriously discussed on a national level
5718732 some doctors believe that when a patient reaches a certain stage of illness age or injury any treatment other than comfort care is futile and should be withheld or withdrawn even if a patient wants treatment because of deeply held values or a desire to live
5718733 currently doctors and hospitals can refuse treatment simply because of their personal opinions this is not a medical determination but simply a value judgment
5718734 unless people strongly object and legislatures take action now this new and deadly game of doctor knows best may be coming soon to a hospital near you
5718735 based on his votes in the senate the answer to that is yes
5718736 the question becomes will the pro life movement be able to persuade him otherwise between now and the election
5718737 wed be hopeful that hed leave bushs policy in place
5718738 while barack obama is ideologically committed to it john mccain has indicated that embryonic stem cell research is in his words academic
5718739 in order to preserve the integrity of canadas judicial system we respectfully ask that you consider this complaint seriously investigate beverley mclachlins inappropriate behavior and recommend to parliament that she be removed from office
5718740 the behavior of mclachlin outside the courtroom on the order of canada advisory council has reduced respect for both her and the canadian judiciary
5718741 any complaint that comes in even if it is frivolous does get processed and responded to
5718742 what if the new brunswick decision gets appealed to the supreme court i see no way she can hear this case and claim she is going to be independent fair and neutral
5718743 in recent days the right wing blogosphere and rumor mongers have falsely accused senator obama of misrepresenting his position on born alive legislation
5718744 senator obama supported such legislation when it did not threaten the constitutional rights embodied in roe v wade
5718745 the state and federal born alive infant protection acts did not include exactly the same language
5718746 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
5718747 it is rather astonishing that in light of the new documents that came to light this week the obama campaign here continues to brazenly misrepresent the content of the state born alive infants protection act that obama killed in 2003
5718748 the claimed differences cited simply did not exist at the time that obama and his colleagues voted down the bill on march 13 2003
5718749 holy fucking jehovah have these toe sniffing turds ever even considered doing journalism for once in their lives instead of kissing government ass 24 hours a day gyyyaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh

5718770 local government is where the actual governance is its more realistic its more sustainable and its more secure
5718771 kill me and you will suffer the wrath of my entire clan
5718772 you cant start from the top down thats a waste of energy
5718773 you have to start from the grass roots people dont trust each other you start small and when people see that its working they will want to join
5718774 ideally bottom up is very good for somalia but the problem is the warlords to make any government work they have to be included in some way
5718775 at this point we have no relationship and i dont see that changing
5718776 its just gotten to a point where i think lines were crossed if you ask me coaches should be coaches management should be management and i dont think those lines should be crossed but when you cross those lines you put yourself in position for things like this to happen
5718777 they made different promises saying they would take care of me
5718778 it all goes back to last year even before camp i sat in on a meeting with whisenhunt and the team owners bidwills and their exact words were they wouldnt let me go into this season without a new deal well here we are a year later and still no new deal the deals they put on the table were slaps in the face as opposed to deals that would take care of me for me its an uncomfortable situation i feel lied to by the organization its hard for them to ask me to give me my all when it hasnt been reciprocated
5718779 turned down a bunch of teams willing to give up first round picks they clearly dont want to get a deal done
5718780 overall people are still at much greater risk of dying if they drive while intoxicated
5718781 often the problem that we face is that people who are intoxicated but have only a minor head injury can appear exactly the same as those who do have a severe injury that needs an urgent operation
5718782 the level of consciousness is one of the only measures of head injury severity that we have and it is a challenge to compare the outcomes of those who have been drinking alcohol and those who havent
5718783 a patient who has been drinking may seem to have an equally severe injury to another patient because of the effects of alcohol but make a better recovery
5718784 theres plenty of evidence that the more alcohol you drink the more likely you are to be in an accident and that the accident will be more serious
5718785 these results show its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
5718786 its not often you see studies where they have managed to improve function in this way
5718787 what they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage and both restore and maintain normal activity
5718788 as we age we have an increase in protein misfolding and general faults in protein processing so the ability to maintain an effective system to clear these would be beneficial
5718789 however a direct line to the clearance of defective proteins in the brain is not so clear from this research

5718816 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
5718817 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
5718818 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
5718819 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
5718820 we know that deaths come one to a customer eventually we will have a 100 percent mortality rate in both groups

5718858 we believe that accounts and finance should not be the domain of few and students from across the country need to be trained about the latest trends of industry in order to come at par with their counterparts across the globe for this the faculty has to be well equipped with the necessary knowledge information and latest teaching skills we at nifm strongly believe in taking the standards of financial education to the highest international levels and feel that public private partnerships of this sort can actually help the indian cause
5718859 we believe that the best students are those who are trained by the most effective teachers and who best to train our faculty than the trainers of the bureaucracy we believe that this programme will help us retain our cutting edge over any other player in the business
5718860 that it is the governments endeavour to provide jobs to all our youth with nifm training the icfe faculty we are hoping to help in this effort nifm trained icfe faculty will be able to considerably enhance the employable skills of their students in even the remotest areas of india providing the much needed platform for these students to be gainfully employed

5718870 while no one would ever wish for a hurricane or flooding a good two or three day soaking caused by a tropical depression will go a long way in helping out this drought condition

5718874 the internet is very much an entertainment resource for young children mainly due to how well tv broadcasters such as nickelodeon cartoon network the bbc and disney have adapted and extended their traditional offering to the web
5718875 as children hit their teenage years general entertainment sites tend to make way for games focused sites which offer a massive range of easily accessible games and ensure that teenage gaming activity extends far beyond the ps3 wii and xbox consoles
5718876 its interesting to see that the sites with the heaviest concentration of young adults split into two conflicting groups functional and entertainment this mirrors the uneasy transition of growing up from teenage years into adulthood and the associated increase in responsibility
5718877 is a small wonder a kind of wooden pier stretching over land when the doors of the turrets concealing its telescopes glide open it looks like a childs drawing of a warship with its decks and galley its largely timber and steel construction and great views out across the waters of kielder forest the observatory really does feel like a ship at sea especially as night settles in and only the ghostly shrieks of barn owls remind you that you are a long way from tidal waters
5718878 barclays observatory is a happy balance between what appears to be little more than a simple almost cartoon like timber gangway with some sheds on top and some fine technology inside with the cranks and cogs needed for the telescope turrets sitting delightfully within the simple wooden walls floors and ceilings it is rather like being in an early victorian steamship especially in the dark when the red lamps glow red keeps light pollution to a minimum
5718879 the league of women voters is an all volunteer organization who has only one interest good government and civic discourse
5718880 but joe sestak refuses to even grant them the courtesy of providing potential dates for a debate with craig williams ironically joe sestak ran for congress in 2006 under the guise of open and responsive government two years later and joe sestak has already forgotten who sent him to congress
5718881 joe sestak refuses to address the energy crisis and he just voted for the largest federal budget and tax increase in our nations history
5718882 no matter how many times he tries to dodge the debates sestak cannot hide from his voting record
5718883 bonus issue is intended to enhance the value for our long term shareholders in the wake of the unprecedented all round growth of the bank the dividend 30 approved for the previous fiscal is the highest in the history of our bank incidentally it was also the year in which our net profit crossed the rs 150 crore mark
5718884 esops also has been approved which is a way of rewarding the employees for participating in the excellent performance of the bank employee stock option has been recognized generally as an effective step to attract retain and motivate the employees this scheme is expected to create a proprietary interest and provide them an opportunity to share the growth of the bank and also create long term wealth in their hands

5718892 noile norme vizeaza o segmentare a clientilor persoane fizice in clase de risc in functie de care se stabileste gradul maxim de indatorare acceptat practic acesta poate varia intre 55 si 70 insa estimam ca in majoritatea cazurilor gradul de indatorare va fi in jur de 65 din veniturile nete eligibile

5718896 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5718897 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5718898 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5718899 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5718900 lacht danke f r die blumen aber viel gibts nicht zu verraten ich bin derzeit einfach gl cklich und das sieht man mir wahrscheinlich auch an
5718901 ich will gar nicht leugnen dass einige meiner kollegen da manchmal ein bisschen schummeln lacht aber ich geh re nicht dazu ich versuche gesund zu leben ich genie e das leben und verstecke meine 46 jahre nicht

5718905 ich glaube ich bleibe lieber bei meinem kleinen fitness programm aber ich finde es faszinierend wie konsequent sie das durchzieht sie ist wahnsinnig diszipliniert
5718906 es ist zugegebenerma en nicht immer leicht ich muss meine tage ziemlich gut durchplanen auch deshalb halte ich es f r wichtig k rperlich in guter verfassung zu sein eine freundin hat mir mal gesagt dass man seinen herzschlag mindestens einmal am tag ordentlich in die h he treiben sollte das versuche ich
5718907 ich koche gerne f r meine familie und das ergebnis ist meist sehr gesund viel gem se viel fisch wir essen kaum fleisch aber schokolade ist bei mir immer zu finden da kann ich einfach nicht nein sagen

5718910 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve

5718915 i want to share this joy with my good friend and teammate dong dong
5718916 we worked together and without my teammates i could not perform so well
5718917 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
5718918 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
5718919 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day
5718920 i wish her all the best all the happiness all the joy that comes with that certificate in hand
5718921 im just so happy that they get to love each other in such an official way
5718922 when ive got no makeup on hair scraped off my head he always says oh you look cute because its the complete opposite to how hes used to seeing me everyday
5718923 women think that men think you look best all dolled up but as a band girls aloud are always so dressed up so im preferred in my trackie with my hair up and no make up my work gear is most peoples going out for dinner look so its the other way round
5718924 there will be times when ive got changed three of more times before i leave the house could be hormones bad hair day feel fat or spotty i have it all
5718925 california doctors cant refuse treatment to gays on religious grounds court rules
5718926 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the antidiscrimination requirements
5718927 furthers californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5718928 the california supreme courts decision proves that these activist judges are willing to deny our first amendment religious freedom in order to create rights for homosexuals
5718929 for instance the ruling probably means that regardless of their beliefs everyone in the states wedding industry must service gay weddings california family law attorneys must handle gay adoptions and same sex divorces and so on
5718930 if homosexual marriage remains legal the courts will soon start mandating homosexual marriage ceremonies in all churches
5718931 here comes the orator with his flood of words and his drop of reason
5718932 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5718933 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5718934 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue
5718935 we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5718936 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5718937 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5718938 its appeal is just tremendous and we can bring that to the games it is exciting fast and spectacular
5718939 you can have the court in the middle set up temporary stands and have 10 000 people watching it
5718940 we have worked on becoming more viewer friendly and will bring an exciting sport to the games
5718941 theres a lot of great memories that i have about her
5718942 weve still got one more to make we still have one more game to go together well see how that goes down
5718943 she does a lot of things for us especially offensively
5718944 weve got time to sit down and figure it out weve got a couple days to kind of make some adjustments and do what were going to need to do
5718945 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5718946 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5718947 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5718948 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5718949 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5718950 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5718951 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5718952 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5718953 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5718954 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5718955 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5718956 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5718957 the value of the common equity is technically symbolic at this point and has no tangible effect on actual operations
5718958 the problem is that the gses common equity serves as a barometer measuring the markets perceptions of the challenges they face
5718959 preferred shareholders and even holders of the two entities 19 billion of subordinated debt
5718960 as the perception of their capital strength wanes policy makers are going to conclude that we are better off nationalizing the gses the case will be made that the collective needs lower mortgage rates and only a strong liquid and publicly minded gse can help bring that about
5718961 it now appears that the administration may be and may have been deliberately undermining investor confidence in the gses capital conditions for the purposes of reorganizing the entire structure of the mortgage markets in the us
5718962 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5718963 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5718964 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5718965 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5718966 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5718967 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5718968 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5718969 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5718970 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5718971 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5718972 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5718973 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5718974 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5718975 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5718976 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5718977 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5718978 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5718979 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5718980 this is a planning took where all things are going
5718981 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5718982 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5718983 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5718984 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5718985 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5718986 we had them today but we arent impressed with the quality so arent recommending them
5718987 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5718988 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5718989 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5718990 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5718991 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5718992 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5718993 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5718994 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5718995 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5718996 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5718997 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5718998 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5718999 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5719000 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5719001 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5719002 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5719003 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5719004 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5719005 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5719006 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5719007 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5719008 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5719009 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5719010 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5719011 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5719012 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5719013 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5719014 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5719015 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5719016 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5719017 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5719018 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5719019 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5719020 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5719021 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5719022 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5719023 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5719024 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5719025 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5719026 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5719027 i am fed up with correcting my students atrocious spelling
5719028 you would not dream of spelling the words stealth or wealth with an f as in stealfth or wealfth so why insist on putting the f in twelfth
5719029 by now everyone must know firmino or have heard of him
5719030 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5719031 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5719032 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5719033 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5719034 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5719035 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5719036 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5719037 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5719038 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5719039 who is the one guy you would buy a ticket to watch
5719040 maybe pat white hes a pretty explosive quarterback seems like a pretty fun guy to watch
5719041 last year id have to say desean jackson cause hes a do it all guy i like watching west virginia and their offense watching those speed guys out there and obviously hes a pretty decent receiver
5719042 i know hes a dynamic player i know hes electrifying
5719043 they use him more in the run game i think hes a little more of a running back but hes definitely another exciting player
5719044 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5719045 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5719046 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5719047 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5719048 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5719049 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5719050 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5719051 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5719052 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5719053 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5719054 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5719055 the instrumental version when i say instrumental i meant orchestral why im listening to the song i dont know but i love it though

5719065 family planning providers work to provide family planning services so its really not acceptable to the people i represent that this administration is considering allowing doctors and nurses and pharmacists that have received their education to provide services to now be able to not provide those services if they dont want to
5719066 whos going to provide access to contraceptives services if the administration provides this large loophole to deny services
5719067 providers are given an oath now they get to pick and choose what they want to do if a regulation is issued she said
5719068 the american psychological associations so called study is nothing more than a conclusion supported by opinions screened to match that predetermined outcome
5719069 the apa ignored or downplayed large peer reviewed studies showing a clear link between abortion and subsequent problems such as depression
5719070 professionalism and intellectual honesty are not concepts i would associate with this report
5719071 over 600 post abortive women asked to meet with the apa about their experiences with abortion and depression
5719072 the apa brushed them off just like it dismissed any scientific study that didnt agree with its agenda

5719079 the five leases that have made up the shell perdido project off galveston since 1996 are not classified as producing only when it starts pumping the equivalent of an estimated 130 000 barrels of oil per day at the end of the decade will it be deemed active since 1996 shell has paid rent on the leases filed and had approved numerous reports with the mss minerals management service including an environmentally sensitive resource development plan and an oil spill recovery plan that is subject to unannounced practice runs by the mms drilled several wells to explore the area at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars and started constructing the necessary infrastructure to bring the oil to market

5719085 as a discount broker schw makes money on every transaction it does for its clients
5719086 for schwab it doesnt matter whether the market goes up or down its just matters that the market keeps on chugging along
5719087 investing in schwab is like betting with the casino and not the gambler and those kinds of odds ill take any day fact is all that matters is that stock and options traders keep plying their trade
5719088 and well they have increased trading activity helped schwab post better results for the last quarter and that trading surge has continued into july with average daily trades to date already 7 9 higher than in june
5719089 moreover the growth in the individual investing sector is huge you see companies are increasingly putting the responsibility for retirement planning back on their employees
5719090 so as baby boomers retire en masse and incrasingly get more involved in the management of their own investment accounts they have to find someplace to turn for sound investment advice
5719091 their market share has grown by leaps and bounds today schwab is the largest discount broker in the united states and is the no 1 provider of online trading services that dominance should continue well into the future
5719092 of course the big players in this field are combination brokerage houses and investment banks
5719093 most often when volatility in the markets goes up so does trading volume this record sized volatility right now is driving almost record setting levels of trading in options and derivatives in particular one reason the company is so strong is that its business is well diversified
5719094 in addition to its trading dominance schwab was also a pioneer in the area of no transaction fee mutual funds making the company one of the three largest u s managers of mutual funds alongside fidelity and vanguard
5719095 and while the second quarter results were lauded its the companys underlying performance that really deserves attention schwabs exceptional second quarter report demonstrates that the company remains successful at attracting new accounts and assets this is a key factor
5719096 during the three months that ended june 30 schwab added 226 000 new client accounts and 26 billion in new assets boosting its total client assets to 1 4 trillion this is almost a perfect storm in which the market is actually driving stock and option trading
5719097 and heres what makes the outlook even better the company just announced that its increasing its quarterly dividend by 6 cents a share an astounding jump of 20
5719098 no doubt a dividend increase of this size indicates the companys bullish outlook for the future increases are hardly ever made unless management is certain the new payout can be maintained and 20 is a substantial increase
5719099 and then theres the 32 return on equity for schwab its likely one of the most enviable roes in the business the firm weathered the market storm fantastically and now its diversification into asset management and advisory services is paying off
5719100 with its industry leading reputation and brand schwab is well positioned to keep raking in profits from traders ook for strong earnings growth to propel the stock price to new levels

5719139 talking about your feelings puts you back in control and reveals the choices you have many people feel pressured into hiding their feelings out of embarrassment or concern not wanting to burden family or friends but hiding under a calm exterior only saves the problem for later and stress can build up until it becomes unbearable

5719147 certainly there are some concerns with the housing market the price of oil and now the banking issues as those things begin to turn around certainly i think the economy will suit
5719148 certainly lenders are cautious in providing financing for new retail developments
5719149 lenders state that the feds have new regulations which in turn diminishes the amount of capital available for borrowing
5719150 having said all this this is not the first recession or economic downturn that these major companies have gone through we remain optimistic that they will continue exploring future opportunities in this growing marketplace as the economy strengthens

5719169 floridas probably one of the best states in the world to deal with hurricanes one thing they do is they always over prepare which is not a bad thing
5719170 was a sign to everybody that they knew this was not going to be a disaster or a major hurricane
5719171 however at this time of year which is really the beginning of the active hurricane season down here nobody takes anything for granted in terms of what a storm may have and hold for them
5719172 we had an okay winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer
5719173 this morning we ambushed nato troops in sorobi district using mines and rockets we destroyed five vehicles
5719174 recently isaf and ana deployed into area and started going on patrol this was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours there were coalition air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties
5719175 the taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike

5719181 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances

5719186 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5719187 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5719188 i agree mrmnmom82 i mean the guy that inhaled vicks
5719189 i think it will be magnificent for the district to be able to own that
5719190 thats prime location right there on the corner of pch and walnut and its something were very excited about being able to acquire all of those properties right there to try to really finish off the face of the entire college and have the corridor from orange to walnut be all college campus property
5719191 the first discussion was to purchase commercial property that fronted pch that were adjacent to the kroc center and that kind of grew to this next block
5719192 it made sense that if we were going to acquire other properties we might as well acquire the other three
5719193 rda is in a position to do that we acquire property on a regular basis we just felt it was the most expedient way to help revitalize this corridor with a city agency to step in on behalf of the college
5719194 i grew up with my dad im an only child my father was a cowboy and he really loved me very much but i think he wanted a son occasionally
5719195 im upset im angry it makes me feel like a non person kind of
5719196 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5719197 cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true

5719202 make a list of what you were grateful for in bill gwatneys life
5719203 he was a better golfer than i was i am not grateful for that but he seemed to genuinely like it if i hit a good shot which is a sign of grace
5719204 if you had introduced me as president bush id be convinced that bill gwatney wrote the script for your service
5719205 i am more grateful than i can say for the support he gave to hillary in this long last year
5719206 we have to understand we can only keep him alive if the love we felt for him and the love he felt for us is somehow manifest in our lives
5719207 he could have taken a lot of other roads but he chose public service
5719208 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5719209 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5719210 for large spacecraft this is done with mechanical louvers basically glorified window blinds that open and close to allow in or reflect heat
5719211 but as satellites get smaller these systems get too heavy and bulky
5719212 weve used thermal insulation similar to what youd find in a fridge and were finding that we need better ways than purely insulating layers to make sure that our spacecraft maintain the right temperature
5719213 there are lots of ways to cool and heat things but they all tend to be complicated and require power and could potentially break down
5719214 something very simple like this requiring minimal power and with minimal mechanical things to go wrong could be quite a useful thing to put on small spacecraft

5719220 he went into it hoping for gold and came out of it with nothing paul admitted afterwards it was pretty hard for him to get going again
5719221 i feel really sorry for rasmus and i wish it didnt have to happen to him
5719222 but i just had to do what i had to do
5719223 if hed been a nice bloke he probably would have won silver but he might not have done lets say the wind had got up and hed broken his mast and finished last and myrgren won it he would have missed the gold this way he made 100 sure
5719224 there are rules but basically it is entirely legitimate to sail your boat in front of the guy to block him completely its not about how well you do just about herding the other guy around the course
5719225 we trained together before sydney and i experienced close up what it takes to win gold
5719226 if sailing is your passion you will have heard of paul goodison but now he will get that recognition outside the sport that stamp of international sporting pedigree
5719227 its a bit like when a band has a surprise no 1 hit and you think theyve come from nowhere only it turns out theyve been playing all the clubs up and down the country for years well paul goodison has been playing the clubs for years
5719228 in this sport there are only one or two sailors who have raised themselves above the parapet and become names outside of just sailing ben ainslie and
5719229 but thats what the olympics can do there are world championships in so many sailing classes every year but there are only 11 sailing gold medals and they are only awarded every four years
5719230 the owners of big yachts sit up and take notice it gives you more options
5719231 when you have won olympic gold you are more attractive to sponsors he is sponsored by volvo who have been pretty shrewd to back him but he will now be able to choose where he goes
5719232 you could see the grin on his face when it was mentioned
5719233 last week it was looking very good for ben ainslie and the yngling girls with huge potential but only potential elsewhere now the team is getting up a real head of steam
5719234 you have to remember that this is a very frightening place to sail it is so unpredictable there are a lot of people who have been caught off balance world champions who were expecting to be on the podium who have finished way down the field
5719235 britain came here as favourites which is a difficult tag to live up to as the only way is down but they are starting to justify it and now have built up a momentum which they can hopefully take into the remaining classes
5719236 i didnt really love america until i was deprived of her company
5719237 with this new process we are reducing the travel distance of a space vehicle from 12 000 feet to 10 000 feet
5719238 we are really excited about this new build process for space vehicles and its impressive results and our air force customer is pleased to have the gps spacecraft used for this new process
5719239 with 12 satellites on order the gps program is ideal for a manufacturing pulse line because similar satellites can easily adapt to a process that mirrors mass production
5719240 the value of a pulse line is that it increases efficiency and therefore enables us to reduce costs as we continue to simplify our satellite designs in order to standardize the items that are inherent in every spacecraft built by boeing the implementation of a pulse line will yield tremendous benefits in the areas of efficiency and cost savings
5719241 nasa engineers and designers were coached by celerant to think outside the box when approaching design during a three day training course
5719242 celerant is fully committed to supporting nasa as they apply innovative thinking and design to 21st century space programs
5719243 meeting these challenging design requirements calls for a novel training approach that enables engineers to go from the fuzzy front divergent end of innovation to the application of tools and methods for converging on final design solutions
5719244 celerant is thrilled to have been selected for this essential program and looks forward to a collaborative future with nasa

5719246 compare a recent episode of nbcs 30 rock to the pilot episode and it almost seems like a different show do that in front of 30 rock creator exec producer
5719247 if i never see that pilot again it will be too soon fey says of her series first episode pilots are difficult id never written a pilot script before and i was by myself trying to figure out how to do this
5719248 fortunately the pilot process typically involves a learning curve and 30 rock is just one show to evolve from its original blueprint
5719249 despite the early adjustments fey says it wasnt until the episode

5719256 it was a great experience for me to do some independent research and it was exciting to see that local governments across the country are taking action against climate change
5719257 we have lost confidence in kevin lyons abilities as states attorney
5719258 our officers in conjunction with the correctional officers at the county jail arrested transported and booked the suspect into the county jail its incomprehensible to us that lyons failed at the court hearing to demand forfeiture of akulas passport to the sheriffs department as a condition of his bond this mistake allowed the suspect to flee the country lyons mishandling of the case is an embarrassment to law enforcement in peoria
5719259 the situation in peoria heights continues a pattern of neglect in the states attorneys office that worsens our crime problems and demoralizes law enforcement
5719260 in case after case the officers deputies investigators and detectives at the local departments have done their jobs they have arrested and detained suspects they have imprisoned convicts and they have worked very hard on the frontlines to make peoria county safer the problem time and again has been in the prosecutors office in the peoria heights case the states attorney did not know what to do to keep an international suspect in peoria in other situations he has been too liberal with plea bargains and ultimately soft on crime no wonder we have the highest crime rate in the state over the past five years i am committed to working in tandem with peoria law enforcement i will take a hard line on criminals and together we will make peoria a safer place for us all its time for a change in the states attorneys office

5719266 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
5719267 when you make a mistake you easily run into barriers
5719268 valencia will not be a complete street circuit there will be lots of run off areas for safety reasons
5719269 ive had a nice but not particularly relaxing couple of weeks in the alps during the break ive spent some time with family and friends but mostly ive been training valencia is a grand prix ive been looking forward to as its not only a new circuit but a new street circuit from what ive seen and read about it i think itll be a great track to race on so i cant wait for the weekend to start the atmosphere will no doubt be fantastic as well because the spanish have a real passion for formula one valencia should be a track that suits our car so im hoping well have a good race and take something positive away from spain
5719270 im looking forward to a good race in valencia the new track looks great and should be really interesting to race on as at monaco and montreal our car goes well at these kinds of tracks so im hoping well put in a good performance there it shouldnt take too long for the drivers to get used to the circuit and for the first time the rest of the grid will be learning it with me ive had a nice two week break during which i returned home to japan to catch up with family and friends but now im looking forward to the last few rounds of the season
5719271 valencias street circuit is a new addition to the calendar
5719272 the cars will run a lower than normal rear wing drag level in valencia due to the five long straight sections and the long sweeping corners will all be taken at full throttle bridgestone will bring the soft and super soft tyres both suited to street circuits

5719275 theres no historical precedent here for this sort of action
5719276 its not just that american assets are cheaper the untold story here is that foreign investors are no longer willing to finance american debt
5719277 if you were to look at america inc as a company its like owning a company and you own a smaller and smaller fraction of it so the fraction of america inc owned by americans is diminishing
5719278 because the focus right now is the weakness of the american economy and anything to keep our economy going is welcome

5719293 if youve ever thought about writing an autobiographical expos you might want to give margaret atwoods 2000 novel the blind assassin a read first the novel opens with the suicide of the younger of two sisters who goes on to become a famous one novel writer with her posthumous book that gives this book its title as things progress we have three braided pieces of genre fiction the elder sisters autobiography is really a mystery story that gradually becomes the center of the book the younger sisters tale is a romance of sorts and the title work is a piece of fantasy science fiction spun by the younger sisters lover or so it seems all of this is set mainly between the coming home of an injured wwi veteran who is the sisters father and the immediate post wwii period when the younger sister suicides economics and external tensions between capitalist industrialists and unionists affect the families involved but internal family politics makes these stories work together to a satisfactory almost poetic conclusion here i rediscovered atwoods great gift for melding historical events and a wonderfully quirky grudgingly self revelatory character that i first found in her book of poems from 1970 the journals of susanna moodie in atwoods hands mortality is an elegant psychological adventure if that entices you to seek her book out good i knew i was reading this braid but it only occurred to me toward the end that i was reading these three different pieces of genre fiction
5719294 what do you think about my idea that dialog in saramago plays an opposite role to what it does in most novels i generally see dialog as sharpening the focus and bringing the reader in close to the scene but saramagos dialog has more of a softening effect pulling the lens back and making you consider the story as a whole rather than the current scene

5719330 i am pleased to announce that as a result of intensive diplomatic efforts by all parties concerned the 56 participating states of the osce have today agreed at a special permanent council meeting to increase the number of military monitoring officers in the osce mission to georgia by up to 100
5719331 the decision foresees the immediate deployment of 20 military monitoring officers in the areas adjacent to south ossetia
5719332 i have also asked the head of the osce mission to georgia to redeploy to south ossetia the existing eight monitors special attention should be paid to the situation in the akhalgori region
5719333 i hope that todays decision by the osce will contribute to the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and facilitate the prompt opening of humanitarian corridors to assist the civilian population and prepare for a return of refugees and internally displaced persons
5719334 i also hope that the osce military monitoring officers will very soon be ensured safe and free movement throughout georgia
5719335 i wish to express my sincere gratitude to the russian federation and georgia for the constructive approach and fruitful work of their respective delegations to the osce in vienna

5719409 los cupos los doy yo porque soy el rector no voy a dar al cnu cupos en las carreras donde tengo mayor demanda si quieren vamos a un debate sobre eso en idiomas preescolar y especial tengo que seleccionar a la gente con criterio en el cnu nos dijeron que el 30 era por carrera yo voy a cumplir con el porcentaje pero no en los programas donde tengo dificultades no me pueden penalizar por eso
5719410 hay carreras en las que no hay plazas para la opsu porque tienen una demanda muy grande nosotros estamos respetando el acuerdo y jam s se dijo que era 30 por carrera si pretenden que sea as debieron plantearlo desde el principio
5719411 vamos a evaluar si la solicitud es el n mero de seleccionados o de los inscritos la opsu puede enviar su 30 sin que eso est condicionado por nuestras listas nunca una cosa ha dependido de la otra si hay que enviar eso se env a pero suponemos que lo m s adecuado es remitir la lista de los inscritos
5719412 yo entend que 30 era por carreras pero eso ha generado confusiones hay mucha inquietud y la pol tica nos guste o no es nacional porque se decidi en el cnu
5719413 es cierto que mon meros decidi apoyar el proceso en una cuant a cuyo monto no estoy en condiciones de precisar
5719414 en todo caso la aportaci n ten a la estricta finalidad de respaldar la realizaci n de eventos culturales y de opini n p blica en solidaridad con el acuerdo humanitario debido a que el gobierno colombiano no ofreci ning n apoyo efectivo para ese costoso y complejo proceso

5719426 most urgently needed at a time when the u s and its allies are targeting two of the last few russian allies in the middle east iran and syria
5719427 america will remain the biggest economy and military yet its diplomatic authority will continually trim till it finally rests at a more acceptable level to the rest of the world
5719428 from its handling of iran to its desire to play a more effective role in the middle east and world affairs it is apparent that the new russia is not prepared to be thrown around like a lightweight any more as it was after the end of soviet union
5719429 the return of russia portends a shift in the balance of political forces in the middle east that for the moment at least appears to weaken the american and pro western side of the balance and to strengthen the iranian side
5719430 one would think in light of the iraq debacle and the continuing disgrace of detention without charge that these two world powers would have been among the last to plant their flags in the shifting soil of moral high ground
5719431 has shown that washington will not always come to the rescue of its allies in their time of need

5719433 how can you talk about occupation when you are occupiers yourself the georgians along with the americans occupy iraq and now they are trying to portray themselves as fighters for freedom and democracy
5719434 all arabs are mad at georgia because it sent its troops to iraq and took part in the occupation of that arab land
5719435 if it werent for russia georgian forces would still be in iraq
5719436 there is a potential danger of countries in the arab world to take russias re entry into the global political scene as a major power broker as a signal to openly side with moscow
5719437 back to the worst years of the cold war where the arab world stagnated economically forever indebted to the soviets for arms and munitions that were always a step or two behind those of the west

5719459 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5719460 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5719461 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5719462 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5719463 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5719464 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5719465 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5719466 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5719467 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5719468 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5719469 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5719470 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5719471 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5719472 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5719473 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5719474 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5719475 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5719476 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5719477 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5719478 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5719479 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5719480 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5719481 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5719482 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5719483 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5719484 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5719485 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5719486 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5719487 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5719488 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5719489 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5719490 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5719491 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5719492 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5719493 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5719494 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5719495 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5719505 stephen was such a kind generous warm hearted unassuming person many of us probably underestimated him as a person and as a horseman
5719506 after sams tragic death in 1997 we all admired stephens determination and courage to come home and take over sams business at drumeen lodge and continue in the sport which robbed him of his brother
5719507 along with his cousin nigel and a few friends he organised the sam moore fund which supports a variety of safety initiatives in various equestrian disciplines as well as covering the cost of paramedic cover at all our northern region one day events

5719512 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5719513 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5719514 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5719515 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5719516 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5719517 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5719518 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5719519 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5719520 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5719521 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5719522 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5719523 who are open to doing something on the production side
5719524 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5719525 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5719526 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5719527 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5719528 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5719529 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5719530 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5719531 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5719532 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5719533 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5719534 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5719535 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5719536 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5719537 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5719538 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5719539 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5719540 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5719541 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5719542 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5719543 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5719544 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5719545 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5719546 the hospitals security video recorded sabocks care from april 28 when he choked on his medicine while a nurse stood by without helping him and through his day without food until his death from a heart problem
5719547 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5719548 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5719549 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5719550 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

5719571 five years ago when it started it was a bike ride with just one guy now hundreds are here to support the men and women who fought to keep america free
5719572 i was sad because there wasnt any support when i think of what they did for us we should be there for them

5719578 the visual arts are very different from the performing arts
5719579 while art can have more to do with creating something permanent performing arts have a lot to do with interacting with audiences
5719580 as smaller more specialized departments the degrees will be more exciting
5719581 the idea that washington d c is our classroom has been especially true for art history and art
5719582 its exciting to see the performing arts program particularly the theater program mature and take advantage of washingtons political climate in their work this season
5719583 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5719584 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5719585 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5719586 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5719587 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5719588 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5719589 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5719590 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5719591 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5719710 everyone always dreams about winning but you never think theres a reality to something you dream about
5719711 i crossed the line and was thinking oh my gosh ive won im just so proud of myself
5719712 my coach has always told me you have to go in expecting to win even if you have a bad day or youre not the best in the field
5719713 he believes in me so much enough to say chris go out and win each round because why would you want to go to the next one knowing that someones beaten you

5719725 you should hear some of the shit that john adams does when people arent watching
5719726 well now were watching hes going to be held a bit more accountable for his behavior
5719727 were going to let him know that hes got a lot of fans and we love him but we also love to see youtube videos of him laying the mack down on betsy ross after hes had one too many ales i think that is just going to be great content our readership has a real thirst for this

5719729 weve got to build a better mousetrap gwash6969 one of our best posters really needs to be heard

5719735 well be ok but i think its going to be like our defense was a year ago
5719736 our offensive line is going to be a lot better in october and november than they are at the beginning
5719737 normally i wait until i really need to go before i get up
5719738 and then i was sort of sauntering over to the john to be honest i didnt even realize how quickly id need to go to get there on time and next thing you know im covered in piss
5719739 i mean this is not the first time either its like once fine its an accident twice okay youre entering carlos pena territory here but youre still cool but for it to happen this often its really unacceptable
5719740 look bj has a lot of natural talent a ton of speed and hes got the unique ability to get where he needs to go very quickly
5719741 but the fact of the matter remains that youve got to expend some effort once in a while if you want to be a star in the big leagues thats just a fact
5719742 and bj cannot keep not hustling to the bathroom i mean what if he needed to you know um number two and that happened think about that

5719758 the remarkable thing is that a few months ago there was a buzz about how this wedding would look like the front row of the oscars that it was going to be star studded and a huge blowout
5719759 it was at their house in los angeles which is this gorgeous kind of modern house all day long while they were getting ready for the wedding they were wearing slippers that said i do
5719760 they were very much into the spirit of the wedding
5719761 the house was all lit by candles arranged by a wedding planner named mindy weiss who is a premier wedding planner in los angeles
5719762 after portia said her vows ellen turned to the crowd and said wait a minute thats what i was going to say then they went on with the vows and ellen started crying and they promised to be with each other forever
5719763 ellen told us that she felt like the luckiest girl in the world and said that portia is now officially off the market
5719764 the dinner for everyone was made by their personal chef and it was a complete vegan dinner because they are both vegans they had a vegan red velvet wedding cake
5719765 in our story we also talk about this kind of amazing love story that the two of them have had that a lot of people dont know the details of
5719766 they first met when portia was on ally mcbeal about seven years ago
5719767 ellen said that she knew this was her soul mate and they have been together ever since
5719768 the big thing is last may in california the states supreme court ruled that the ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional and it was right after that that ellen proposed she immediately bought portia this amazing diamond ring
5719769 they have talk about having children a lot and they go back and forth ellen is in that phase where she thinks its hard to imagine being people of such privilege and not sharing what they have
5719770 cine sunt suporterii stelei sa injure pe cine vor ei mi am pus deja o gheata in cui iar daca mai continui sa joc asa o pun si pe a doua
5719771 we had an okay winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer
5719772 this morning we ambushed nato troops in sorobi district using mines and rockets we destroyed five vehicles
5719773 recently isaf and ana deployed into area and started going on patrol this was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours there were coalition air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties
5719774 the taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike
5719775 would not deter isaf from supporting the people of afghanistan in their fight against the enemies of peace and stability
5719776 we now believe that an unidentified male rented a room from the couple on or about august 1 this year
5719777 mr yang informed his mother that the new lodger was a student and that he came from the jinzhou area of the northern seaport city dalian we know little of who this lodger was we do not know whether he had yet moved in and whether he lived there at the time of the killings
5719778 we have no further information to identify the lodger and inquiries to trace him have so far failed if they have moved in then they may know things about the victims lifestyles arguments they may have had or visitors to the flat
5719779 inquiries are continuing into allegations of internet betting scams and the obtaining of fraudulent university qualifications
5719780 as to potential motives for the killings some people may wrongly have assumed that they brought it on themselves and that may be stopping people from coming forward
5719781 but they were not involved in high level stuff there was no printing press for forged documents no racketeering
5719782 they did not have a jet set lifestyle they were living in a small flat in the west end of newcastle involved in low level stuff which does not point towards justifying why these murders have happened
5719783 the level of violence used in the killings is completely disproportionate to the level of minor fraudulent activity discovered on the couples computer thus far
5719784 we must not lose sight of the fact that xi zhou and zhen xing yang are victims of a senseless killing and their parents and friends are left devastated and unable to comprehend what has happened

5719790 washington must provide more effective and realistic support for pakistans fragile democracy
5719791 musharraf was an embarrassment to the bush administration once bush began using a rhetoric of democratization
5719792 if the u s and europe are wise they will give the elected prime minister their full support and pump in aid to help ensure that democracy in pakistan still an embryo actually has a fighting chance
5719793 musharrafs legacy is a tattered and divided civilian government that has been emasculated by the military a polarised and heavily armed populace a disastrous economic crisis
5719794 consciousness is the choice of which abstractions we experience out of an infinite number of ways of slicing the continuity of the universe its the feeling of existence that is the choice
5719795 these medical students represent the very best of the next generation of u s physicians

5719797 all of us at the university are extraordinarily proud of javay and this validation of her achievements
5719798 she typifies what we look for in all our medical students the highest standards of excellence as well as the heart and soul to play her part in transforming the health of underserved communities

5719800 imageright helps customers need to scale effectively efficiently and economically to accommodate the growth of their businesses and to monitor their productivity as they do so thats why this enhanced functionality is a critical part of promoting the ease of doing business for our customers
5719801 this gives us the ability to know that a policy is about to go out of standard in two days rather than find out about it after the fact
5719802 argue it until you are blue in the face but this blog band proved that we music blogs actually get it right some times
5719803 i dont really know if ive ever realized that they were blowing up
5719804 just been really busy for the last three years its good to be busy
5719805 heres a charismatic playfully slipshod band unconcerned with making all the loose ends meet up audacious enough to leave the dot connecting to us
5719806 tapes n tapes kneel before pavement wire beach boys and pixies bearing their influences more publicly than notebook logo sketches but facing the task of averting obviousness they play the uncool card
5719807 really didnt have an agenda other than us being happy with how the record turned out and helping us realize what we had in our brains
5719808 wed just play stuff and put mics in the room usually it didnt take too many tries before it was yep thats how we want it to sound
5719809 the sounds he gets hes amazing first and foremost hes just a really amazing engineer
5719810 for some reason there is a misconception that he really has a heavy hand in how things are produced or like really affects how bands operate at least in our experience he just kind of enabled us to get to where we wanted to be
5719811 i really like how things sound on vinyl and really want to hear things the way theyre supposed to sound it was really important how it sounded and the quality of it when it got compressed down to mp3 really didnt represent how we wanted it to sound things got really crunchy in a way that they werent supposed to be the record is pretty overdriven and when you compress it into mp3 format it kind of gets mushy sometimes the idea was when we were mixing it in the studio this is how it sounds and this is how we intended it to sound
5719812 it seems like theres less bands right now that im noticing that are getting a big communal push from blogs
5719813 it was a time when music blogs were this new thing and all of a sudden people were starting to look there for bands
5719814 we were really fortunate to be at the right time for that stuff
5719815 when i go back home its nice to be able to do something thats totally unrelated to the band
5719816 i go in for a couple days a week and do some data analysis
5719817 more than anything if i didnt have any sort of a job when we were home id probably be pretty bored
5719818 i totally understand the allure of quitting the day job it is nice to have health care though
5719819 yesterday 10 of our soldiers were killed in afghanistan 21 others were wounded during a joint reconnaissance mission with the afghan national army
5719820 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hit hard
5719821 the initial patrol was reinforced with quick reaction forces close air support and mobile medical teams during the engagement a large number of insurgents were killed
5719822 dozens of people from the shia community had gathered at the hospital where the bomb went off
5719823 around 13 militants are confirmed dead in the clashes which continued for several hours

5719829 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5719830 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5719831 the refreshing new visual style bold art direction and visceral gameplay of the house of dead overkill truly makes it standout on the wii
5719832 sega is committed to delivering unique gameplay experiences and the house of the dead overkill certainly qualifies as one of our most innovative sega games coming to the wii

5719836 by pioneering new business models the pc has quietly remained the single leading platform for games not only in terms of consumer usage but revenue generation
5719837 the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically the real key has been the rapid growth in penetration of broadband connected pcs in all markets around the world broadband connected pcs are the key driver of growth for pc gaming dfc intelligence estimated that by the end of 2007 less than one third of households in the top 20 markets for games had a high speed internet connection that clearly indicates that there is still plenty of growth to come the initiatives of the pcga will be a key enabler of growth as they will help the industry identify key trends and opportunities in this rapidly emerging market
5719838 we do not have a huge presence in china or the pacific rim

5719840 they dont give a fuck unless it happens to them in their neighborhoods
5719841 this is a cultural problem wherein thug behavior is lauded and cooperation with the authorities is frowned upon
5719842 until the residents of these neighborhoods rise up united against thugs gangs druggies etc and let them know they will report the criminal no longer be intimitated or paid off with dirty money and take back their neighborhoods these daily shootings will continue
5719843 cubrir o superar las expectativas de los clientes y de ese modo satisfacerlos y fidelizarlos
5719844 cuando el farmac utico tras escuchar al cliente y ofrecerle un producto que satisfaga sus necesidades le presenta al menos un segundo producto que mejore los resultados del primero o sea complementario para lograr los resultados demandados
5719845 hay cuatro claves para que una venta cruzada sea eficaz la primera ser a definir una oferta de producto tentadora para los clientes la segunda ser a conocer qu clientes est n siendo compartidos por la competencia la tercera identificar a los clientes con mayor probabilidad de comprar y la cuarta convertir a los clientes de categor a d de menos valor en a de m s valor
5719846 stas deben ce irse a los productos sin receta aunque por definici n hay que tenerlas en consideraci n en todos los contactos con los clientes por ejemplo al dispensar una receta a un paciente diab tico el farmac utico puede interesarse por el estado de la piel del paciente pues la piel seca puede aparecer con la diabetes y con eso se abre la posibilidad para recomendar una crema hidratante corporal
5719847 las ventas cruzadas se pueden realizar con todo tipo de clientes siempre que los conozcamos y entendamos sus necesidades y conducta de compra
5719848 hoy en d a ya no es suficiente un conocimiento del producto hay que posicionarse en la mente del consumidor y lograr que perciba a la farmacia como su farmacia
5719849 no se trata de ofrecer dos productos en vez de uno sino de escuchar al cliente y ofrecerle el conjunto de productos que se adecuen a sus necesidades explic ndole c mo cada uno de ellos va a contribuir a cubrirlas de forma complementaria
5719850 ante un dolor puntual se puede ofrecer una caja de analg sicos para casa otra para el coche y una tercera para el despacho pero esto transmite una mala imagen al cliente que ve un deseo del farmac utico por colocarle el m ximo de art culos sin embargo una venta cruzada aut ntica ser a la que en el mismo caso ofrece un analg sico si es adecuado junto con por ejemplo una bolsa de gel caliente fr o de esta forma se puede aumentar la rentabilidad fidelizando
5719851 la media nacional de unidades vendidas por operaci n comercial est en 1 7
5719852 el farmac utico tiene que cambiar su mentalidad porque si no las aprovecha nos comer n las grandes cadenas no hay que olvidar que adem s de un establecimiento sanitario somos una empresa que tiene que cubrir gastos en mi caso las intento potenciar al m ximo en todo lo que no sea medicamentos como productos de puericultura cuidados corporales etc no se trata de enga ar a nadie sino de que el cliente est contento y se le fidelice
5719853 es verdad que hay que formar al personal que est en el punto de venta para sacarle provecho pero en l neas generales creo que el farmac utico est bien capacitado para hacer ventas cruzadas que es algo que funciona muy bien en los productos de venta libre

5719860 the cause is just it is the honour of france and its armies to defend it
5719861 with no threat of losing clientele to competitors many schools and school districts behave like the monopolies they are
5719862 these school districts focus on strengthening the organizations position and goals rather than meeting the needs of students and parents
5719863 in general smaller school districts proved to be more parent friendly than large school districts
5719864 most of the top performing school districts in this assessment enroll between 1 000 and 5 000 students

5719877 there is still a huge cultural barrier for some people we find quite often that librarians and e learning staff are very open to this but when you go within the humanities and you look at traditional areas such as english there is a real resistance to technology

5719881 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5719882 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5719883 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
5719884 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears

5719920 how does opensolaris suns effort to free its big iron os fare from a linux users point of view is it merely a passable curiosity right now or is it truly worth installing linux format
5719921 there are fewer packages available than for a mainstream linux distro although they do have over a thousand and certainly enough for a fully functioning system the package naming is slightly odd package names begin with a handful of capital letters eg sunw or fsw
5719922 the equalisation process after hampering us during the mid season has actually led to the best race of the year as the cars were all very well matched out there today after the recent adjustments this win is a good omen for the future for crs
5719923 i got caught in the middle of other peoples accidents and then stuck behind slower cars i took a bit of a lunge at the black viper and spun but after that i settled in and managed some good lap times the car was awesome and im delighted we won
5719924 the governor better play nice or the legislature will give him a spanking
5719925 i think the senate president had the governors back more times than was the best interest of public policy
5719926 i think its a bad thing for gov blagojevich in light of jones being his strongest defender in the capitol
5719927 emil jones used his position as senate president to give those without a voice better health care better funded schools and increases in the minimum wage emil jones is a man with a big heart and a man of action he is a true champion of the people he didnt just do the talk he did the walk all of us in illinois owe him a great debt of gratitude
5719928 this has been a great privilege to work on behalf of the people of illinois for over 35 years
5719929 i want to thank my leadership team and my colleagues in the senate who worked with me side by side to accomplish many things for the people of illinois
5719930 with emil in office it has always been assumed that he would stand in the way of any effort to remove the governor from office with jones leaving who knows what will happen
5719931 the star spangled banner followed by words from mayor robert eschbach and the opening of the capsule wcmy am radio will do a live broadcast
5719932 its easier to make sure that money is not co mingled
5719933 i feel this is set up so all schools in illinois will not make state standards by 2014
5719934 we can see theyve performed better than any other year
5719935 real programmers just throw a bunch of 1s and 0s at the computer to see what sticks
5719936 uns geht es um die von beiden institutionen erfolgreich gelehrte innovationsmethode des design thinking durch gemeinsame wissenschaftliche forschungsprojekte wollen wir herausfinden welche faktoren diese art des ingenieurartigen und kreativen entwickelns von innovationen f r alle lebensbereiche letztlich so erfolgreich machen
5719937 ingenieure sind stets bestrebt die grundlegenden ergebnisse wissenschaftlicher forschung so anzuwenden wie es den bed rfnissen der menschen entspricht wenn wir diesen innovationsprozess k nftig besser verstehen hilft uns das der gesellschaft in k rzerer zeit bessere l sungen bereitzustellen
5719938 zusammen mit der stanford university werden wir auch untersuchen wie solche von kleinen multidisziplin ren teams hervorgebrachten innovationsprozesse k nftig weiter verbessert werden k nnten
5719939 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5719940 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5719941 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5719942 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5719943 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5719944 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5719945 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5719946 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5719947 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5719948 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5719949 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5719950 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5719951 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5719952 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5719953 as the largest city in the sunshine state it makes perfect sense that we utilize one of miamis most abundant renewable resources sunlight

5719956 we are pleased that friendster has deployed opensocial apis for the benefit of users and developers alike
5719957 friendsters launch is another major milestone in the adoption and deployment of opensocial throughout the social web and around the world were particularly excited that opensocial is helping friendster bring new social applications to users in asia and we look forward to seeing users embrace these apps

5719966 i suddenly became aware of a head sticking up near the blaze it was mr mcburnie
5719967 he was still on fire and there were only strands of clothing left on him
5719968 he had a leather belt on which was still on fire and i cut it off and cut off a boot as well the only one he still had on
5719969 it was difficult to pick him up because of his burns but we had to get him away to safety from the fire
5719970 he told me he was working on a car and the petrol went up
5719971 they can be volatile and be like missiles and the area had to be cleared
5719972 when we train every day sometimes there are workouts you dont like dont want to do bob says youre putting money in the bank i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank after bob and i both grab a little break itll be time to start depositing

5719974 the lord god helps me therefore i have not been disgraced therefore i have set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be put to shame
5719975 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5719976 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5719977 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5719978 partnering with boomi makes sense for centive and our customers
5719979 we both have award winning native saas technologies that are considered best in class and we both believe that saas offerings are the future of business applications boomi proved they could meet our demands for performance and ease of use and boomi on demand easily handled our toughest high volume data transformation projects the saas industry is challenging traditional thinking about technology and boomi is redefining how we should all think about integration it should be easy affordable and fast

5719982 i havent had fixins this good since was in californeeeee
5719983 this will mark the first time that either of these celebrated creators have appeared at eccc

5719985 in addition were expanding our show floor by an additional 15 000 square feet to accommodate the shows substantial growth

5719994 be not afraid of life believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact
5719995 youd see micro spacecraft mainly in communications instead of companies sharing a large satellite you could have even small companies getting their own micro spacecraft
5719996 for the military undetectability is also important either for surveillance applications or when it comes to zapping other satellites
5719997 and when it comes to a spacecraft less than 5 kilograms 10 pounds you cant really detect it unless its within a quarter of a mile of you larger spacecraft can be detected from farther and consequently blasted out of the sky
5719998 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5719999 thermal control was really the big barrier to developing miniature spacecraft
