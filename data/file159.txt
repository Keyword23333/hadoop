1590005 es ist unentschuldbar dass amerikanische steuerzahler weiter die rechnung f r projekte begleichen die die iraker in vollem umfang alleine zahlen k nnen
1590006 die zahlen lagen leicht ber den erwartungen allerdings ist die hohe risikovorsorge ein wermutstropfen

1590012 a depress o a imperfei o no amor para podermos amar temos que ser criaturas capazes de se desesperar ante as perdas e a depress o o mecanismo desse desespero quando ela chega degrada o eu da pessoa e finalmente eclipsa sua capacidade de dar ou receber afei o

1590027 antes de construir un museo guggenheim se debe pavimentar calles y arreglar jardines
1590028 se dice que 80 o 90 por ciento de los habitantes viven en ciudades pero eso no es cierto pues un elevado porcentaje de la poblaci n vive en suburbios inhabitables y est n enga ando a la sociedad al pensar que viven en la civilizaci n urbana y la verdad es que viven en la no la civilizaci n
1590029 con el guggenheim habr a que resolver otros problemas tan sencillos como pavimentar las calles arreglar los jardines

1590037 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013 but successful business models may differ from what many observers expect
1590038 while location based advertising integrated with sophisticated algorithms holds a lot of promise the current reality rather points to licensing and revenue sharing models as the way forward for social networking start ups to grow their customer base and reach profitability recent evidence the agreements between gypsii and both garmin and samsung similarly loopt has established partnerships with all major us cellular carriers
1590039 we dont know how many people have applied for voluntary redundancy as management wont say
1590040 there are almost daily meetings between management and the chapel but theres been no indication at this stage that there will be compulsory redundancies
1590041 we were in the middle of pay talks and were due to have a meeting about that on thursday but now the redundancy situation will be top of the agenda
1590042 we will fight this because we cant really see how they can afford to lose these jobs we are close to the bone as it is
1590043 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
1590044 we have entered a period of significant difficulty for the regional press evidenced by share price movements of quoted peer companies with both cyclical downturn and structural changes impacting the sector
1590045 the depth and duration of the downturn is as yet unclear and we expect the difficult trading conditions to continue for at least the next year
1590046 our capable management team will actively seek efficiencies and cost reductions to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn and focus efforts on developing our on line businesses
1590047 more and more people had been telling me i ought to race 70 3 as the distance would suit me but until id raced one i wasnt too sure
1590048 for me it was a logical step up after racing olympic distance even though i hadnt really had a great deal of time to train specifically for this distance after the
1590049 i made things a little bit harder for myself by also getting a pro slot rather than as an amateur as i have always done up until now
1590050 i had a great swim coming out of the water in 23m 58s hot on the heels of multiple ironman winner belinda granger who would go on to win the race
1590051 my cycling was strong up until the 30 35 mile mark at which point i started to notice the fact my body is used to racing for a total of two hours
1590052 it wouldnt be any different than playing any other quarterback
1590053 our main focus is to go out and win a game hes seen us as a defense weve seen him as a quarterback and our focus down there would be to get after him it wouldnt change in that regard it would just be much different seeing him in another uniform
1590054 all i can say is im waiting for apple iphone nano coming this christmas
1590055 to me it was pretty shocking what were seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity people have had this suspicion that we are really close but we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore
1590056 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1590057 to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1590058 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1590059 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1590060 i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1590061 fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program
1590062 theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1590063 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1590064 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists
1590065 they are committed to helping north korea integrate into the international community and thereby partake in the peace and prosperity on the and in northeast asia
1590066 we will defeat the enemy overseas so we do not have to face them at home
1590067 why is that man taking a photo of a wall

1590072 we wanted to give our fans another chance to be a part of a very special moment in the history of fiffin market and recreate a cd release show that was overshadowed by the tragic events of the 2007 san diego fires
1590073 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1590074 they got a lot to do they got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1590075 you have a choice to make you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1590076 the human rights abuses in this stalinist country still exist and persist the north korean leader has yet to fully verify a highly enriched uranium programme and there are still more steps to be done on the plutonium programme
1590077 in order to get off the axis of evil list then the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1590078 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority
1590079 all legal and constitutional hitches are being removed to impeach the president
1590080 discussions held in a cordial atmosphere were very positive frank and productive major progress was made as broad consensus emerged on key issues it was decided to re convene the meeting on wednesday to consult with other partners of the ruling coalition contacts with fata leaders and other allies will also be made during the course of the night to get their input for the wednesdays meeting
1590081 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism
1590082 and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1590083 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story
1590084 when they announce your name and when the gold medal goes to you while youre out on the podium its pretty neat
1590085 i think it would be really neat to have the games in the city
1590086 when they told me i was speechless this new organization has done some wonderful things for this team and to induct me into this ring of honor is unbelievable
1590087 a guy coming here as a rookie free agent not knowing too much about the vikings and their history i find myself in 2008 and in the ring of honor im just shocked
1590088 to see this dream becoming a reality to see this baby being born is absolutely amazing
1590089 this year is no exception and there are more of them
1590090 knowing the impact this college has had on the community and the impact the community has had on the college its a wonderful moment when you have the synergy of town and gown
1590091 its basically to show them all these worlds are out there
1590092 what you see on the screen really reinforces the music
1590093 the images were so inspiring and beautiful that i wanted to learn more
1590094 they are a scientific instrument but they can also be an artistic instrument
1590095 the new works im doing are just perfect for me because they combine all my passions into one
1590096 the more people know about other places on earth the more they will respect people in other parts of the planet
1590097 the system costs more but you recapture your money within three to five years
1590098 we have to plan for the worst and hope for the best because its a strange world
1590099 she couldnt pass a library even in a town she had never been in without getting emotional
1590100 the library in the days of mary jo hutchings was a major factor in the education of the young
1590101 in that sense she felt her responsibility was to make this reservoir of knowledge in mount prospect a place where young people especially would develop creative thinking
1590102 the greatest lesson she ever taught me was that to achieve happiness you have to look outward and serve other people
1590103 you cant fake it when the audience is looking at your knees
1590104 the idea isnt to believe in yourself but to believe in yourself believing in yourself
1590105 n o existe outro lugar no mundo como a pen nsula da cor ia

1590108 corey used to bowl a lot when he was in junior high and we even held his bar mitzvah party at arlington lanes so we decided to hold this fundraiser there
1590109 they have 40 lanes and should be able to accommodate a lot of people we are expecting between 150 and 200 to come
1590110 i hope that corey would be happy with what we have been doing because everything we are funding were his favorite projects
1590111 we thought the tree was going to fall on the house
1590112 it was crazy were laughing about it now but it was crazy
1590113 its just amazing how much mother nature can do in five to 10 minutes
1590114 everything from traditional trees and power lines down to lightning and roofs being ripped off schools
1590115 nows the time to start thinking about the next time around and to make sure they have a plan on what theyre going to do next time this happens
1590116 i was in a big truck but ive seen wind that can pick a truck up theres no safe place really
1590117 he hung on to it forever he ran it into the ground
1590118 what are you going to do sit there and cry in your milk it doesnt work that way
1590119 are you on borrowed time yeah but its good borrowed time if i can get another six months out of this thatd be great if i get two months out of it thatd be great too its been a great ride
1590120 he was always looking for the fun things to do in life
1590121 losing ken is just a tragedy we all feel quite robbed
1590122 the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell
1590123 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1590124 children who evacuated buildings or went to work at factories on that day have not returned 63 years on the atomic bomb deprived them of normal life
1590125 police had carried out an investigation on a sexual crime involving intercourse against the order of nature involving anwar based on existing legal principles and procedures
1590126 as a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit spacex recently accepted a significant investment
1590127 the most important message id like to send right now is that spacex will not skip a beat in execution going forward
1590128 we have flight four of falcon 1 almost ready for flight and flight five right behind that i have also given the go ahead to begin fabrication of flight six
1590129 the people in the investment business they are looking for companies that are long term investments
1590130 if we have three consecutive failures then we probably dont know what were doing and we should quit
1590131 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1590132 we can only hope that the president of the united states elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority for whom the top priority is human survival
1590133 the voices faces and forms that vanished in the hell
1590134 this study should teach us the grave import of the truth born of tragedy and suffering that the only role for nuclear weapons is to be abolished
1590135 children who evacuated buildings or went to work at factories on that day have not returned 63 years on the atomic bomb deprived them of normal life
1590136 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1590137 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1590138 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1590139 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1590140 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1590141 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1590142 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1590143 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1590144 some tables sound very smooth relaxed and warm while others are very lively transparent and accurate you can picture it this way a family sedan takes out the roughness in the road for a smooth and easy drive but doesnt give you a feel for the road nor much in the way of hi performance sports cars have terrific agility and relay the road conditions instantly but can be hard over rough road further like other components tables vary from not so great to excellent production value parts quality engineering design
1590145 right here is my work cubicle normally men should keep out of this area except to clean it
1590146 that is a lie what i mean is i am sorry i dropped you so hard it was unchristian of me i didnt think about how much i would hurt you
1590147 id just kicked you in the belly and in the balls
1590148 but it is not right that you should touch me flesh on flesh exposing me to the temptations of the flesh i the society of brethren do not believe a man should have uh knowledge of a woman unless they are man and wife
1590149 its not right and nothing will ever change my mind
1590150 we dont still have books we have this there are several hundred thousand texts available lets see if i can find a manual for the scoot
1590151 millions of pages oh you mean of this document just hit this button to scroll down
1590152 it is strange to read something that isnt holy writ the letters are so regular how do they do this
1590153 ive never really thought about it therell be a book on it somewhere or i can ask someone at the university for you my mother didnt have the money to send me but i know a few people
1590154 it is very wonderful i have seen so much today that my mind is almost numb with wonder but this this is one of the most wonderful i dont understand all the words but it is like a door opening thank you
1590155 i suppose thats something else you might not have learned to do
1590156 well thats what sister thirsdaughter said i cant cook anything like as well as my mother could of course but for a man i can cook well
1590157 it comes of being a bachelor still at nine and twenty most men marry much younger often straight from living with their parents and have never touch a skillet
1590158 im damn sure she never touched the inside of a kitchen next thing youd be suggesting that she washed plates or changed diapers
1590159 my father did help he cooked on sundays and took his turn in the chores list with the dish washing but many people in new eden consider cooking and house keeping to be womens work i did it because i lived alone of course but i would have expected my wife to do the bulk of it if i married
1590160 things are very much the same here except that it is you who are expected to do the cooking and as a woman living alone ive been looking forward to it i can burn nearly anything i suppose i should show you where things are
1590161 whoever it is they opted for an almost polar approach and we dont have any platforms in position for a close look at them were redeploying now but its going to take a while
1590162 cics managed to isolate a count on the footprints they make it ten best estimate is that five of them are in the four million plus tonnage range
1590163 yes i understand you may tell our people back in grantville that i think it would be best if i simply resigned from the seat
1590164 michael and i well we do not wish to be parted again and he must remain in magdeburg even if he loses the election as we expect he will have to lead the opposition
1590165 so we have decided i will go to magdeburg also and if my father is willing we will ask him to move in with us
1590166 gunther achterhof has been pestering us for weeks now to agree to let becky run for the house of commons from one of magdeburgs districts
1590167 ive never lived in the city anywhere in the province only even visited just a few times i could just manage to move there in time for the election the idea seems absurd
1590168 who cares gunther sure he says nobody else will either if we run becky he says shell win in a landslide
1590169 i have to say i agree with achterhof magdeburg province is even more ah i will say july fourthish rather than radical just to avoid haggling than the state of thuringia franconia
1590170 im quite familiar with the subject you know i estimate shed get at least two thirds of the vote in any district in the province if she ran in the city itself shed almost certainly go unopposed the crown loyalists have given up there for all practical purposes
1590171 no unless youd like to hear the latest grantville gossip
1590172 pleasant it is at least if you enjoy the exploits of rambunctious girls you know denise beasley dont you

1590177 waaaaaaaaaaaaaah i wanna go to the class waahh make her shut up
1590178 hey this isnt an airport shes going to a classroom not boarding a plane
1590179 whats really crucial is we are trying to be as fiscally responsible as we can
1590180 i think our school district is appealing to a lot of people
1590181 sad to lose a lawyer of such skill determination and professionalism
1590182 they had a list of legal questions about our proposal so theyve asked us to delay this discussion
1590183 weve submitted the questions to our corporate council and in fairness to the association well have this discussion at a later date
1590184 we realize our good landlords are already doing credit checks
1590185 but we also had some folks tell us they thought checking a prospective tenants credit history could be an invasion of privacy so we removed the requirement
1590186 you can google it youll see t shirts youll see signs
1590187 in this economy the way things are today you have to think outside the box its a play on words it was never meant to insult anybody
1590188 we fully support her first amendment rights but theres a greater issue here is this the language that can be used to best promote her car wash shes using a double entendre that could leave a negative impression of her business and the city
1590189 that is protected speech commercial speech particularly since the mid 1990s is entitled to a fair amount of protection under the first amendment
1590190 theres nothing obscene about that at all they ought to lighten up and have a sense of humor in my mind its a gross overreaction
1590191 its part of my car wash lingo im considering putting it on shirts for my employees
1590192 my sign is my sign and we still live in america
1590193 this has been a long time coming and i am thankful that we got here
1590194 now we are passed that point and can get to the fun stuff of selling and designing
1590195 she just didnt think it was important or she didnt want anybody to know
1590196 the problem is when youre having a trial and not disclosing that stuff it could be an ethical violation not to disclose it we have to be aware of these things so we can make sure these cases are aboveboard
1590197 we really have to look at why were doing it
1590198 i think it is something we will ultimately have to do
1590199 the judge did not address the merit of the case
1590200 our position is we educate the public about what goes on at rodeos the injuries the abuse the deaths
1590201 if they sue in illinois well fight and i fully expect we will win
1590202 they were trapped against the metal breakwall and were getting battered by pretty big waves
1590203 i deployed a disc from about 40 yards out to get to the male and reeled him in
1590204 it was a lucky toss and she got a hold of it
1590205 it sounds like she got sucked out first and they stood on a rock for a little while
1590206 when the water died down they thought they could make a break for it but then they got caught in a revolving door of waves
1590207 i dont know anyone who is an exceptional enough swimmer who could have gone out there
1590208 i was just doing what any of us would have done it really was a team effort
1590209 oppose the enactment of any legislation that would infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms
1590210 you cannot say i like this and i dont like this
1590211 if there is legislation to ban armor piercing ammunition that would penetrate the body armor worn by sheriffs deputies i do not have a problem with that if there is legislation that would ban 50 caliber sniper rifles that can kill from 3 000 yards away i do not have a problem with that
1590212 i have to think about all the deaths in this county that are the result of guns all the kids who are dead because of guns
1590213 i cannot sit here today and say yeah i will get behind it
1590214 enhance the economic viability and to preserve the character and beauty of downtown st charles
1590215 i think it is apparent that the people who prepared this get an f
1590216 it validates the concerns we raised but it doesnt provide any viable solutions
1590217 to date the parties conducting todays hearing have not yet acknowledged the significant public benefits this transaction would provide to the regional economy and to dozens of chicago area communities that would see a reduction in freight traffic as a result of the transaction
1590218 the reality is that if this transaction were approved more than 60 communities would experience rail congestion relief roughly two times the number that would see increased rail traffic
1590219 the negative impacts that are measurable far outweigh the measurable benefits
1590220 approval of this rail sale will be totally life changing
1590221 if they want to operate on that line then they have the obligation to pay for the mitigation
1590222 thousands of people in towns that abut the existing cn lines stand to benefit from reductions in rail and highway congestion a decrease in train noise and relative improvements to safety
1590223 it would also set the stage for possible enhancements to metra service
1590224 the way to resolve the problem is not to shift the problem its is to not make it a problem for anyone
1590225 we need to take a step back and see how we want to move freight traffic through the region
1590226 the main thing on the governors mind is capital and getting people jobs not getting a raise for himself

1590237 kami tidak yakin kalau keputusan mutasi berasal dari baperjakat karena kalau memang baperjakat yang dipercayakan oleh bupati bekerja secara jujur professional tentu kami tidak akan menjadi kezhaliman yang tidak manusiawi ini

1590270 yes i believe my nephew has be sodomized i believe in him i have faith in him
1590271 but pusrawi cannot do the forensics anyway those were just notes referring to the medical report and not a report
1590272 then he the doctor suggested that we go to hkl for a proper report
1590273 the pusrawi doctor dr mohamed osman abdul hamid only did a short check up so how could he decide it was not sodomy
1590274 that is just bull they just want to exaggerate the story and divert attention the important thing is anwar ibrahim is doing that thing and its happened
1590275 we invited him anwar to swear on the quran and he twisted things around we as muslims should be brave because its the truth and be afraid if we are guilty
1590276 pretty clever that bit about not being a murderer professionally
1590277 didnt leave me much of a set up with the rapist thing though
1590278 nah you make jokes to a stranger about being a rapist you either come off as an asshole or majorly creepy
1590279 nuh uh lived in the city all my life had to get out and look around though
1590280 coyotes probably i did a little reading up not much though could be wolves i guess probably coyotes
1590281 i wouldnt think so i have pepper spray in my pocket
1590282 i didnt think you could pepper spray a wild animal
1590283 pretty much any time you use pepper spray its on a wild animal of some sort
1590284 im not too good at that kind of thing though
1590285 but id like to be better ive been thinking lately that ive spent a lot of my life talking but not much of it saying anything id like to get better at that
1590286 i also want to learn to enjoy life more not just the parts i control though not just the parts that are easy to enjoy i mean like this like nebraska what the hell right i didnt intend to get dumped out on my ass in the middle of nebraska but since im here i might as well enjoy it right
1590287 so yeah goofy college kid decides to take a journey discover something about herself something about life so very clich
1590288 so far ive slept on busses or in bus stations or in towns park benches and movie theaters and stuff once i spent the night in a post office under one of those tables where you sort your mail
1590289 i didnt realize i was going to be sleeping in nebraska barns
1590290 it just isnt an adventure if you dont get stranded in a nebraskan barn
1590291 you want you can get in here with be cramped but well both fit
1590292 do you think theres such a thing as a perfect day
1590293 i think yeah yeah i think so i mean every day were given has the potential right like how you were talking about learning to enjoy life not just the parts that are easy to enjoy you said so think about it if you get good at no if you perfect that way of living what would keep every day from being perfect
1590294 so if some days were better than others that would mean that there would be days that werent perfect perfection by definition means that there is nothing better
1590295 do you think theres such a thing as a perfect day
1590296 i had a friend once he said that every day in the garden of eden was perfect he said that once god banished adam and eve that was the end of that no more perfect days
1590297 i know he said that a day no matter how incredible it is cannot be perfect that was the true punishment for eating the forbidden fruit and no matter how great the day is going something will happen that will make it less than perfect even if its something as mundane as a broken pencil
1590298 yeah it seemed like he was pretty right on at the time but looking back it seems kind of defeatist
1590299 so what about it you think theres such a thing as a perfect day
1590300 if you had asked me five years ago i would have said yes if you would have asked me two years ago i would have said no
1590301 but youre asking me now and i dont know im not sure if i believe in magic as much as i disbelieve in reality theres something more i think something different something that the world doesnt tell to just anyone you have to look with a certain kind of eyes and believe with a certain kind of soul and love with a certain kind of heart is that too dramatic maybe maybe thats okay though maybe thats accurate
1590302 i think theres more to the world more than most people realize more than most people will ever realize i think that even in the routine there can be wonder is it magic i dont know but i refuse to believe that theres just that one kind of world where best buy and wal mart and saks exist where theres such a thing as an suv where people laugh fake laughs and live fake lives and the only thing thats real is death at the end i refuse to believe that
1590303 sweetheart please do your mother a favor marry a rich man the next time you get married you are beautiful enough to do it you could get any man you want you know honey you could make your life so much easier
1590304 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1590305 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1590306 but the players arent 100 yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1590307 normally when you have quality when you are playing well and creating chances you will score goals
1590308 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1590309 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1590310 its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1590311 the matter is closed now he ronaldo is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1590312 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1590313 maybe it was my fault because of the chance i had you have to score those chances i cannot think of a worse night its a catastrophe
1590314 its disappointing and the players feel very bad right now weve not done enough and if theres a problem its with the players
1590315 its easy to blame the manager or other things but the players need to do a little more
1590316 its definitely the worst night of my career and its so disappointing
1590317 we need to do more and we need to change everything and try to go for the win you need a goal to win games
1590318 we played so many games last year around 65 its just four weeks or so break there have been a lot of games
1590319 he basically is not in the right mind set to play here because of all the things that went on
1590320 the football team has moved forward the train has left the station he needs to jump on the train or if we cant get past all the things that have happened i have to keep the train moving he respects that he understands that
1590321 mccarthy and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1590322 we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1590323 frankly for two people to sit there and talk for six hours i think it was very productive
1590324 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process has started we rehashed all the different things that went on we agreed we disagreed
1590325 the fact was he was not in a proper mind set to move forward to be part of our football team we talked about competing for the starting quarterback but we didnt really get much into it because we kept talking about all the things that have happened up to this point

1590388 as substantial capacity is being built there will be losses the consumption growth will not be equally robust resulting in prolonged pain for the industry
1590389 the cement business is cyclical and this is not the first time that we are in it the situation is not that worrisome this year but the signals can be worrying as access supply hits us next year
1590390 of course there is fear as plans are being deferred and there are no fresh investments in the sector
1590391 even if consumption grows by 10 per cent in fy09 and capacity utilisation is 85 per cent on a capacity of 230 million tonnes there will be surplus of around 15 million tonnes
1590392 we always ask our children when anyone and everyone is coming to visit because it is their home the only home they have and they heartily agreed
1590393 the children see him as a kind uncle coming to visit not in his official position
1590394 there are geniuses poets artists and physicians among the kids who call mercy their home and yet they are labeled as klong toey children and not the children who are worthy of proper education and jobs
1590395 the visit of mr uncle president is telling them they are of great value and not to believe any of the bad stuff people might say

1590399 the military recruitment of children under the age of 17 however is a clear violation of international law the u n optional protocol no attempt to recruit children 13 16 is allowed in the united states pursuant to treaty it is also important to consider the effects of the game within the context of the ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan undoubtedly soldiers now recruited through americas army will serve in these wars the invasions and occupations of iraq and afghanistan are violations of international law and contributing to their continuation through the propagation of the game is if not a criminal violation a moral outrage
1590400 i believe letting an offender live near children is like giving a bottle of vodka to an alcoholic
1590401 i am asking the supreme court to think about the innocent children in our society instead of the sex offenders rights
1590402 i believe allowing sex offenders to live near a place where our children play learn and worship is unacceptable
1590403 we think the appellate decision showed that the law in this area is clear
1590404 were hopeful the supreme court will agree with the appellate court and deny the petition
1590405 we really hadnt had an opportunity to enforce it but we will if it takes place
1590406 so much of what schools do is based on trust not only must kids trust their teachers but parents have to trust those teachers too

1590408 as goes the fate of jessicas law so goes the fate of our ordinance further given the legal uncertainties and practicalities involved we have doubts as to whether the district attorneys office would elect to prosecute a state parole agent for violation of the new ordinance
1590409 there are a lot of constitutional questions jessicas law doesnt give us enforcement tools the county law new ordinance faces some of the same issues
1590410 shafter passed an ordinance six months ago with specific distance requirements arvin considered one but the city council has not acted on it
1590411 my bigger concern is that lifetime registrants are no longer on parole and under state supervision
1590412 most of them seem to play by the rules most of the time i havent seen a need for it a local ordinance at this point
1590413 everybody on the street knows who the sex offender is
1590414 what a great day today is the day the lord has made and i am grateful to him
1590415 i dont have any doubt that he didnt do these
1590416 one of the worst cases of tunnel vision weve ever seen police seized on steven phillips as a suspect and refused to see mounting evidence that someone else actually committed these crimes
1590417 reach some sort of reasonable opinion as to what went wrong and then you know begin to talk about what can be done to fix this procedurally
1590418 we tried the co defendant nava and through that investigation and through the trial process and after discussing it with the complainant at length its clear to me there was insufficient evidence to continue prosecution against amato
1590419 his position as a police officer is important but knowing completely the facts and the circumstances in this instance i think the appropriate decision is not to prosecute because i think
1590420 ive talked to my neighbors and worked things out i really just thought this would be a funny thing to do
1590421 these can come out just as easy as they went in
1590422 hey uhm thanks but i really need to tell you something
1590423 and j i cant believe your dad got us front row tickets how did he do that

1590439 several cases have come to the notice of the government where such joint ventures are projected as a public sector undertaking while the private partner calls the shots at will so the proposals mooted by the planning commission would ensure that these joint ventures do not function contrary to public policy
1590440 the secretary emphasised that credit flow to agriculture needs to maintain its tempo nearly 40 million farmers have managed to get rid of the defaulters tag and the government has taken an undertaking from banks to ensure fresh loans to beneficiaries of the scheme
1590441 the fresh credit should not turn into bad debt else it will badly affect the financial health of banks

1590501 we should tell them that it is next to impossible to arrange an event and have flowers and fancy decorations in just rs50 000 especially since the stage alone these days costs up to that much and more

1590517 i define photo digital manipulation as a process that helps to make the picture better aesthetically
1590518 this is a small part of photo digital manipulation not necessarily the definition i would guess this is where the amateur checks in cleaning up redeye or other little messy details that are easily fixed in this digital world

1590524 political cartoons operate as frames for the organization of social knowledge insofar as they make use of various rhetorical devices metaphors catch phrases depictions etc that purport to capture the essence of an issue or event graphically
1590525 the average american voter especially the average bush mccain voter is not smart enough to understand satire theyll think the magazine is literally saying obama and his wife are militant terrorists
1590526 the main problem with the new yorker cover if its a problem at all is that its humor is intended for a relatively insular like minded readership subscribers to the new yorker a presumably urbane audience with strong obama tendencies no matter what the new yorker says about holding up a mirror to prejudice the cartoon certainly didnt do that it was more like a spyglass
1590527 it seemed to me that depicting the concept would show it as the fear mongering ridiculousness that it is
1590528 courage is needed because there are always some readers who will be offended by the point of view of an editorial cartoon and will demand the job and maybe the hide of the artist
1590529 the natural response is to cringe rather than laugh of course political cartooning by nature deals with caricatures and heavy handed images but usually theyre leavened by some kind of quip some verbal wink in this case theres no punch line

1590536 when listing the people we have harmed most of us hit another solid obstacle we got a pretty severe shock when we realized that we were preparing to make a face to face admission of our wretched conduct to those we had hurt
1590537 it had been embarrassing enough when in confidence we had admitted these things to god to ourselves and to another human being
1590538 but the prospect of actually visiting or even writing the people concerned now overwhelmed us especially when we remembered in what poor favor we stood with most of them
1590539 there were cases too where we had damaged others who were still happily unaware of being hurt why we cried shouldnt bygones be bygones why do we have to think of these people at all
1590540 these were some of the ways in which fear conspired with pride to hinder our making a list of all the people we had harmed

1590607 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1590608 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1590609 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1590610 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1590611 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1590612 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1590665 it is only 84 days since rangers suffered the gut wrenching experience of defeat in the uefa cup final to zenit st petersburg in manchester followed by the failure of their scottish title challenge on the last evening of an impossibly congested sequence of fixtures but the trauma of being beaten by fbk kaunas in lithuania to tumble out of europe at the first time of asking will exceed even that miserable passage rangers began to stare into the abyss in the end it swallowed them whole
1590666 rangers slumped to the worst defeat of their 52 year european history last night without even the consolation of dropping into the uefa cup smith and his players will now be under intense pressure to provide some compensation to their disgruntled supporters in the form of domestic success on current evidence however they are clearly ill equipped to challenge celtics dominance of the spl
1590667 rooneys illness will call into question uniteds decision to fly to nigeria for a money spinning exhibition game against portsmouth at the end of their ten day tour to south africa although of more pressing concern to sir alex ferguson will be the forwards wellbeing and the fact that the manager is likely to start the season without at least seven senior first team players in addition to rooney united will be missing louis saha park ji sung and owen hargreaves all of whom have knee problems and cristiano ronaldo who has been ruled out until october with an ankle injury nani is suspended for the first two matches of the campaign after his red card against west ham united last season while anderson is away with brazil at the olympic games in beijing

1590673 possibly because as recession bites soccer english soccer specifically wallows in a global television rights deal that guarantees each of the 20 premier league clubs 50 million a season from now until 2010 this represents a 60 percent increase in television income at a time when even the banks are not safe and it is the beginning not the end of what the clubs can reap through ticket sales merchandising sponsorship and the holy grail of champions league income currently dominated by english teams so for every denial that newcastles board might make about newspaper speculation and even the denials coming thick and fast from supposed potential purchasers the prospect of another english club going to foreign markets makes sense

1590690 vehicle platform sharing combined with advanced and flexible manufacturing technology enables automakers to sharply reduce product development and changeover times while modular design and assembly allow building a greater variety of vehicles from one basic set of engineered components many vendors refer to this as product or vehicle architecture

1590692 in a multisided strategy the software platform mainly facilitates inter actions between the sides of the platform particularly applications vendors and end users
1590693 in the case of the software platforms we have examined even the weakest relationships are far deeper than the relationships one sees in many one sided industries software platforms cant have direct relationships with the thousands of small developers hardware makers and peripheral device makers yet they document and make apis available to developers provide interface information to hardware and peripheral makers and make sure their platforms have the relevant drivers for the peripherals and they develop relationships through large developer conferences and small focus groups that bring some of these smaller players together at the other extreme software platforms often have deep relationships with several larger partners these relationships involve regular exchange of information and joint work on defining new standards and specifications they may also involve joint investments in product development or marketing
1590694 platform providers must determine how much of the value created through network
1590695 there can be no long value chains where each employee is a rung in a ladder with all the value ultimately flowing to the top such hierarchical organizations are essentially immobile by design they are not capable of creating new capabilities because everyone in the vertical hierarchy is participating in a way that only serves the existing value chain this is great for incremental innovations as such a structure essentially institutionalizes the process of adding more value to existing value chains it is not so effective though for creating new value chains

1590761 is the priority to get traffic through fast or is it to get traffic through with minimal effects on wildlife
1590762 this is not just any old section of the trans canada highway
1590763 when the construction is complete travel on the highway will be safer and more reliable for tourists residents and truckers
1590764 and there will be fewer traffic tie ups on this crucial national commercial transportation artery
1590765 the big concern is that although animals may not be killed directly on the highway we still dont have a really good understanding of how wildlife movement is being affected
1590766 if safety is a big issue then wouldnt a better option have been to have a really serious speed enforcement campaign for a fraction of the cost of twinning a highway you could have pretty much 100 per cent enforcement of the speed limit in an area like that wouldnt that be a more imaginative way to dealing with safety issues in a national park
1590767 were going to be watching very carefully that those mitigation measures with respect to wildlife crossings and corridors are closely respected
1590768 a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep
1590769 and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how
1590770 while this farmer was busy sleeping and planting more seed something was happening to the seed he had planted from the day before it was beginning to grow
1590771 one day as the farmer passes by the field he started in months ago he notices small sprigs all through the field
1590772 why then do we expect to hand a man a gospel tract and have him fall at our feet begging us to explain to him the way of salvation
1590773 we take the lord out of his own work and try to do what only he can do we the farmers try to do the work of not only a farmer but the sun and rain as well let the holy spirit do his work you just plant the seed
1590774 if there is salvation delivered to a lost soul it is the lord that has done it if there is growth in a church it is the lord that has done it
1590775 lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him
1590776 a few days before the passover jesus christ was guest in the home of a man named simon
1590777 this man had been a dead man john 11 gives us the account of his death and resurrection you see this is a vital part of lazarus life story for had he remained in the tomb in chapter 11 he would never have sat at the table with jesus christ in chapter 12
1590778 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins
1590779 but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus
1590780 lastly lazarus was a sign i mentioned above that what drew people to lazarus was christ in lazarus and when they beheld this man he directed their gaze to christ for this reason many people believed on jesus but it was also for this reason many people hated him and wanted him dead
1590781 now you are here and since as i know mr great heart is good at his weapons if you please after we have refreshed ourselves we will walk into the fields to see if we can do any good about a mile from hence there is one slay good a giant that doth much annoy the kings highway in these parts and i know whereabout his haunt is he is master of a number of thieves twould be well if we could clear these parts of him
1590782 we want thee for we are come to revenge the quarrel of the many that thou hast slain of the pilgrims when thou hast dragged them out of the kings highway wherefore come out of thy cave
1590783 to revenge the blood of pilgrims as i also told thee before
1590784 a wise man will make more opportunities than he finds
1590785 be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight

1590811 we are not born to be killed by muslim terrorists
1590812 i understand perfectly well that i am brought to trial for my ethnicity for my being a talysh
1590813 we are citizens of azerbaijan and serve the state of azerbaijan
1590814 novruzali mammadov always served the interests of the azerbaijani statehood and was invariably loyal to the azerbaijani authority nobody can say that he has ever done anything against the interests of azerbaijan or criticized the countrys authority
1590815 we the talysh are proud of being iranian and do not think of ourselves as being separate from our historical homeland that is iran do not let azerbaijans hideous pan turkist regime wipe the talysh people off the face of the earth
1590816 a massive resettlement of kurds to the originally talysh populated southern regions of azerbaijan is underway some 5 000 kurds have moved to lenkoran alone plus some 500 1 500 people per village intolerable conditions for the locals are being created they cannot buy land or open businesses while the talysh population is strangulated by excessive regulation the newcomers are given preferential treatment all the young talysh people have left the region in broad daylight we see azerbaijan destroy the ancient civilization and the language in which avesta the primary collection of sacred texts of zoroastrianism was written
1590817 for all the talysh russia is a great power the successor to the ussr which in its turn was the successor to the russian empire
1590818 russia is our metropolis it is well aware of our problems and it should not remain silent
1590819 not in order to let the people in baku sit over there selling oil
1590820 whenever we raise our voices in protest we are accused of separatism and of fueling inter ethnic hostilities
1590821 finally maria jovanovich has been confirmed as the new us ambassador to armenia what are your comments in this regard
1590822 the approval of the new ambassadors candidacy by the senate is itself an interesting fact as this is the consequence of an important event the thing is that there were senators who till the last moment were ready to impede or freeze the approval of this candidacy as well their posture changed after the state secretariat addressed two written statements to the head of the foreign affairs committee of the senate turkey is just beginning to touch upon these declarations because they slipped the their attention then in one of the statements the united states considers turkey responsible for what happened in ottoman turkey at the beginning of last century up to this moment it was mentioned in all the cases that the massacres and annihilations were committed in the territory of the ottoman empire but it wasnt clarified who was responsible for that now it is mentioned that everything was carried out by the efforts of the soldiers and officials of the empire in the second statement the state secretariat also made it clear that the initiative of setting up a committee with the involvement of armenian and turkish archivists does not anyhow question the facts but rather ensures guarantees for maintaining all the archives in the most proper form these two changes in the attitude of the us administrations particularly the state secretariat led the senators to approve maria jovanovichs candidacy
1590823 can this change anything in the united states attitude towards the recognition of the armenian genocide
1590824 i think the posture of the united states has changed essentially if by saying armenian turkish reconciliation former candidate hoagland believed that both parties should put up with their past and have a dialogue maria jovanovich definitely claims that it is turkey that has to put up with its past clearly these changes are not accounted for by individual approaches they result from the change in the attitude of the state secretariat from this point of view i believe that the day when the armenian genocide will be recognized by the us president is not far from this moment
1590825 what about the prospect of president gyuls responding to serge sargsyans invitation and the two presidents watching the football match of their national teams
1590826 i deem it necessary to affirm ones again that the invitation does not imply any changes in armenias policy in the sphere of the international recognition of the armenian genocide
1590827 o may god put me into one furnace after another that my soul may be transparent that i may see god as he is my brethren we need to be purged how apt we are to want to go to heaven upon a featherbed the grand thing is to learn how to glorify god in the fire
1590828 when god seems to connive at the wickedness of the wicked nay and to countenance it by suffering them to prosper in their wickedness it shocks the faith of good men and proves a sore temptation for them to say we have cleansed our hearts in vain ps 73 13 and hardens those in their impiety who say god has forsaken the earth we must not think it strange if wickedness be suffered to prevail long and prosper long
1590829 but well never get our return on investment with it

1590869 the bridges will further legitimize the afghan government to the people in these areas showing that the afghan government is capable of bringing large scale infrastructure projects to an area neglected by 30 years of war

1590877 as for myself i wasnt actually able to do any of my own training during the summer because i injured my ankle while away on international duty with the republic of ireland i was only in a position to do some physical work once we all returned for pre season on june 30

1590881 in my opinion weve got to be aiming to be in the top six to top 10 at christmas time that will put us in a good position to have a strong promotion push in the second half of the season
1590882 i believe this club should be in the premiership and i also believe we can get there
1590883 the main competitors are obviously the three that have come down derby have signed about 10 players reading are strong and birmingham will be just as tough
1590884 and theres also teams like sheffield united who will be up there challenging im sure but if we can keep ourselves fit and strong and maybe add a couple more faces i firmly believe we can be in amongst that pack
1590885 please keep following and supporting us hopefully at some point we will visit bahrain in association with our main sponsors gulf air and that will give the fans the opportunity to see us in action
1590886 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

1590889 if you keep that sort of people there you get that sort of atmosphere
1590890 these figures surprise and concern me especially the number of weapons being found
1590891 the impression i had was there had been an improvement at the centre in the last few months
1590892 detention plays a vital role in maintaining effective immigration control including the removal of those without any right to remain here and who refuse to leave the uk voluntarily
1590893 we treat everyone with dignity and respect and look out for the welfare of those passing through our detention centres
1590894 i went round the flat to see it and i was told there would be a place for me but i didnt hear anything for a few weeks and then i was told there was a problem with the smoke
1590895 at the moment im stopping with friends and all of my things are in bags and suitcases i hoped this would be a new start but this is getting me down and i want to be confident it will be safe when i move in
1590896 i have just come out of a marriage and this was going to be perfect for me
1590897 but now my hopes have been dashed im staying with my mum at the moment and my three piece suite is on her patio
1590898 we have identified areas of concern regarding fire safety at four separate blocks of flats in arbury park
1590899 to combat the danger to residents the fire service has issued an improvement notice on the two blocks of flats which are currently inhabited
1590900 fire service personnel have also asked for the building control inspector not to grant permission for the additional two blocks to be opened until further fire safety work has been completed
1590901 i usually get a seat as i get on in ely when the train is empty and i like the chance to read but the train gets very crowded
1590902 people will not give up a seat i saw a blind woman get on once and everyone just averted their eyes as she stood there
1590903 you have to be at kings cross about 30 minutes before the evening rush hour trains leave or you will have to stand for an hour getting home it gets so bad you see people sitting in the aisles and on the luggage racks
1590904 it is a very busy route it is a bit less crowded at the moment because of the summer holidays but the carriages are still packed and on the way to london if people are not standing in cambridge then they certainly are by the time we leave royston and hitchin
1590905 its a pain i dont remember the last time i got a seat coming or going from london but theres nothing i can do
1590906 the thing i have to remind myself is that once i am home in cambridge its a much better place to be than in london thats what keeps me doing this
1590907 this has got a amp e written all over it
1590908 this footage clearly shows a young man driving irresponsibly on the roads
1590909 we are looking at this footage more closely noone should be allowed to get away with offences like this and posting it on a website is glorifying poor driving
1590910 i was just coming back from bury st edmunds with sarah coombes who was in my class at the school and we just stopped for a quick look
1590911 it was quite emotional because we felt our happiest time at school was at st felix its like seeing an old friend go down
1590912 i am devastated i always felt the school had a place in the heart of the community and something like this really does tear at the heart
1590913 the police and fire service are remarkably good at getting down to the cause of these sort of fires
1590914 this will have a big impact on a lot of people
1590915 it will be a shock to everybody even my two children who are 26 and 29 and are former pupils at the school were shocked to hear about it they had a really good time there and have a lot of happy memories
1590916 i went to the schools valediction ceremony for the year eights at the end of term and it would be a shame if that was the last one
1590917 joo voisihan sit mutta jos sin kutsut niin silloin ihmisi my s tulee
1590918 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1590919 every prophet commissioned by allah was a shepard over a flock of sheep even you oh messenger of allah
1590920 yes i would take care of a flock of sheep for the people of makkah
1590921 ibn majah abu masud al ansaar radiallahu anhu narrates that
1590922 whenever messenger of allah salallayhi wasallam ordered us to give in charity we used to go to the market and work as porters and we would get a mudd which is a special type of grain and then give it in charity
1590923 saheeh bukhari those were days of poverty and todays some of us have hundreds of thousands
1590924 abu dawud therefore the worker and those who are hired for different tasks and jobs should fear allah
1590925 there are three people who i shall be their opponent on the day of judgment a man who is giving something in my name and then betrays it a man who sells of a free man as a slave and consumes the price and the man who hires another for his labor makes use of his service and then does not give him his wages
1590926 help you one another in al birr and at taqwa but do not help one another in sin and transgression
1590927 suhu udara mulai berubah menjadi dingin ia sudah mulai merajut baju wol untuk saya
1590928 menjadi suami istri selama puluhan tahun lamanya tidak mungkin sama sekali tidak terjadi pertengkaran dan benturan intinya adalah harus bisa belajar untuk saling pengertian dan toleran setiap orang memiliki masa emosional ibumu terkadang kalau sedang kesal juga suka mencari gara gara melampiaskan kemarahannya pada ayah mengomel waktu itu saya bersembunyi di depan rumah di dalam buku catatan saya tuliskan segala hal yang telah ibumu lakukan demi rumah tangga ini sering kali dalam hati saya penuh dengan amarah waktu menulis kertasnya sobek akibat tembus oleh pena tapi saya masih saja terus menulis satu demi satu kebaikannya saya renungkan bolak balik dan akhirnya emosinya juga tidak ada lagi yang tinggal semuanya adalah kebaikan dari ibumu
1590929 surah taha ayah 132 it is only unacceptable to anyone with sound reasoning that a person who ordains prayer as a means of correcting and disciplining his children and his family that he becomes neglectful and ignores the components that will lead them to a life of failure and misery
1590930 surah tahreem ayah 6 allah has put over jahannam angels who protect it who do not disobey him but rather they obey every command of his
1590931 surah huud ayah 43 but allah subhanahu wa taala sent down the rain and the flooding overwhelmed them and his son was drowned
1590932 bukahri and muslim so brothers and sisters let us take the opportunity to seek out this hour and supplicate in it during this time supplicate to allah that which is good for us in this world and that which is good for our children
1590933 help you one another in al birr and at taqwa but do not help one another in sin and transgression
1590934 the extent of the collaboration between local 7 signatory contractors and the construction companies that hire them
1590935 pressur ing neutral employers into agreements to refrain from using non union contractors
1590936 some restraints on competition imposed through the bargaining process where the alleged anticompetitive conduct is anchored in the collective bargaining process concerns only the parties to the collective bargaining relationship and relates to wages hours and conditions of employment or other mandatory subjects of collective bargaining
1590937 it is a thin fiction to pretend that the mrp does not represent a combination between labor and non labor groups
1590938 case for the applicability of the nonstatutory exemption is strongest where the alleged restraint operates primarily in the labor market and has only tangential effects on the business market
1590939 other circuits have found that job targeting programs similar in structure and implementation to the program at issue here do fall within the bailiwick of the nonstatutory exemption
1590940 health insurance leads that target the self employed with a 100 good
1590941 while packaging and importing are part of the encapsulation and packaging story in scala a large part of it as with java code lies in its ability to restrict access to certain members in a selective way in other words in scalas ability to mark certain members
1590942 i cannot sum up how i feel maybe it was my fault because of the chance i had you have to score those chances i cannot think of a worse night its a catastrophe
1590943 its easy to blame the manager or other things but the players need to do a little more
1590944 its definitely the worst night of my career and its so disappointing
1590945 it is a thigh strain we need to wait but it could be one week
1590946 it was another good work out it was a good game with four goals for us and good play
1590947 but the players arent 100 yet that would be difficult right now the other team were fitter than us but you could see we were passing pressing and the understanding between the players was better i am really pleased with the result
1590948 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1590949 when a guy leads the minor leagues in strikeouts as gonzalez did in 2007 he has good stuff and we saw it

1590951 ive been working every day with ty crosby said referring to hitting coach ty van burkelo figuring a few things out
1590952 green yards is a change in the way you think in the way you behave
1590953 you spill more in one accident than a green yard does in a year
1590954 green yards are the future the leading edge most people dont realize what happens weve been the unseen recyclers of the earth
1590955 just going to contaminate that property its going to contaminate the neighbors property and move on from there
1590956 he really took the green yards to heart and made improvements really fast
1590957 green yards is the future for new hampshire and for recycling if its not going to a green yard where is it going
1590958 when you ask the chef to change the menu he has to talk to his boss who has to talk to his boss who has to talk to his boss and by that time the olympics are over
1590959 there are a lot of difficulties we were only allowed to train for one hour and 15 minutes something which was decided by someone who has never played football
1590960 there are a series of factors which could defeat us before we have even got onto the pitch
1590961 but all this gives us even more motivation to try and overcome all these hurdles
1590962 i tried the other method and it didnt work in atlanta in 1996 we took the best team the squad stayed in the best hotels we spent 5 million and we didnt win
1590963 i dont know where i am going to continue my career the season is starting now and i have offers from other clubs one of them is chelsea but nothing is certain were in talks
1590964 its very bad for me to have to watch brazils olympic team on tv my will was to be with the rest of the group but madrid did not want to allow me i am very sad
1590965 ive been royally stung i was desperate to get tickets and this seemed the only place that had any left for sale i did a lot of checks and it looked genuine it is disgusting that this has been done right under the noses of the authorities they seem powerless to do anything about it

1590970 the only sensible option is the introduction of a pay freeze to provide much needed breathing space for the economy
1590971 wanting to use their bullyboy tactics without taking into account the serious repercussions that ensue including further announcements of job closures and job losses
1590972 the latest figures coming so soon after the appaling live register statistics confirm our worst fears with the jobs market nose diving and 132 people losing their jobs on a daily basis
1590973 all the evidence suggests things are going to get worse with many businesses reducing employee hours and numbers at unprecedented levels
1590974 the utter madness of the unions demands for further wage increases
1590975 the use of pest control is seen as good proactive management
1590976 the health care commission have confirmed that health concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1590977 the claim that insects spread hospital acquired infections is entirely unproven there is no evidence of their carriage of antibiotic resistant bacteria being a hazard to patients
1590978 despite this we expect hospitals to take continued action to tackle these pest problems
1590979 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing
1590980 it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning

1590994 if you are the head of the washington apple growers association you may be interested in this
1590995 it gives you much better insights in terms of whats happening on a geographic basis potentially allowing advertisers to target geographically
1590996 we have been using it as a research tool to give us some insight into the relative importance of different terms that people may be using to search on a particular subject
1590997 we are also very interested in uses like the economic forecasting finance sociological studies even in etymological studies to track how new words spread in the population
1590998 what i did was wrong from the bottom of my heart i apologize it was inexcusable i am so sorry
1590999 it has made a difference in a lot of cases
1591000 we could only tell them the category of the surrender
1591001 it doesnt absolutely guarantee it but it certainly would be improper conduct for anybody to issue him a license without checking
1591002 the bottom line is they would not license him without a phone call
1591003 anything below that needs a lot of work and there is nothing in red lodge for under 100 000

1591007 i believe our greatest community asset isnt land or location its people
1591008 you still have to pay bills on a monthly basis
1591009 its not large enough to meet the needs of the community but its a start
1591010 when i was hired i really saw that it was going to be a rebuilding project for a couple years
1591011 this year we have a great core coming back and were adding more and more talent to that core
1591012 when youve got this many kids coming back from last years team weve probably got 12 or 13 kids coming back you can start a lot more advanced
1591013 thats going to be a huge part and some of the new kids are going to come along a lot quicker i think we can do a lot more and advance the kids a lot more throughout the season
1591014 i think at this point of the summer im very encouraged i see us having the potential to again be one of the top two or three teams in the league and be a very good contender this year
1591015 we hold these open camps to see where were at during the summer
1591016 i was very pleased with it we picked up probably six or seven kids out of that camp that well be bringing to our main camp
1591017 if it doesnt come from washington d c it isnt going to happen you dont need to spend a gazillion dollars in washington to get a solution
1591018 attempting to do business with dhs as a small business with a new innovative approach is frustrating
1591019 ive seen little incentive for new technology to move to deployment in dhs
1591020 we have a technology that has proven successful at each step along its development path
1591021 theres definitely a problem and part of it i think is that theres a certain security in doing business with these larger companies
1591022 i think its a bear to go get contacts within dhs but once they get a taste of the kind of quality of work they gcs and s2 do there wont be a problem
1591023 i think their technology can save money in the long term
1591024 i dont think you need to hire as many people if you implement these new technologies
1591025 the question is whats the underlying architecture of all this
1591026 whats the glue that holds all this together in a particular moment in time how does this evolve next year or the year after the technology isnt slowing down in fact the pace of all this is increasing
1591027 weve been able to get in there get more work done
1591028 we took them in and showed them around like they were new firefighters
1591029 i do this because i have a very deep belief that special interest money is corrupting the entire political system not only in wyoming but in the nation at large
1591030 what the united states lacks is a comprehensive energy environmental and economic policy that makes sense along with a transportation policy
1591031 were paying the price right now for a lack of any sort of energy policy over the past 30 years
1591032 i feel like the democratic party best represents where wyoming and the united states needs to go
1591033 weve just got to state a legion at vauxhall alberta tuesday lethbridge 11 libby 5 semifinal round vauxhall 9 dillon 3 semifinal round today 1 p m lethbridge vs vauxhall championship round 4 30 p m second championship game if necessary come out and get a win theres more pressure on us but you just have to come out and play its everyones goal to play for the state championship and thats where we are
1591034 this is great for the city of billings to see both teams in the state championship
1591035 you cant ask for anything else for the city or the kids who have worked hard this is great its going to be a fun day
1591036 i told him i wanted four to five innings maybe six and he gave me seven
1591037 im really proud of him we asked him to throw strikes and the defense made plays
1591038 all i had to do was throw strikes and thats what i did all i kept telling myself was to stay in focus
1591039 our kids are being very selective and when they get that good pitch they put a good swing on it
1591040 its top to bottom if a guy struggles in the middle a guy behind him picks him up
1591041 i just had to keep them off balance worked by curveball and changeup
1591042 they hit the ball right to people and my defense played real good
1591043 i was expecting an easy hop it was a hard hit ball and it kissed the ground hung on the ground and i just reacted it was all i could do
1591044 weve had confidence in him we knew he could do it we just came out behind him and played defense
1591045 for example jackson last year they hadnt been in a state championship in a long time so by them hosting it basically their whole community turned out
1591046 had that been in laramie i know we wouldnt have got all of those jackson people but the other side of that argument is if we get this thing going in laramie all the time then we get other people that will come each year who wouldnt travel to jackson to watch it
1591047 every other sport where weve combined into an all class state championships like volleyball and wrestling and track have all been great events and theyve all grown
1591048 we have continued to stay in contact with the university of wyoming and those discussions are ongoing
1591049 we tried to knock it and what wildfire there was down but it beat us
1591050 it could just be a blip in there for some reason
1591051 people are just continuing to do what they do normally
1591052 these increased targets are new bars for schools and districts to reach and i am confident that wyoming schools will rise to the challenge
1591053 for the most part our reading and math scores are on the same level as last year we did see a significant drop in writing scores
1591054 but when you compare the test results to the 2006 results which is a better comparison based on test administrations we are showing a marked improvement
1591055 for decades in this state we used to say if only we had money wed have a better education system
1591056 the truth is we do have money and weve now allocated it
1591057 i think that one of the things that various school districts and superintendent mcbride are really trying to do is make sure that for the investment that were putting in that were going to get the results
1591058 the truth is that the majority party works so closely with the governor that so often in these last few sessions it hasnt been republican versus democrat its been house versus senate
1591059 i predict that we will have more democrats in total we would really like to be veto proof
1591060 just looking at the races that are out there i think the democrats could pick up a couple of seats but i dont really see a huge change
1591061 people understand that those who do get elected the democrats they do elect do a good job for them
1591062 that encourages other democrats that they can run they can win and they can do a good job as well
1591063 i really believe that you dont become proficient in that craft until about the middle of your second or third term
1591064 i know al is campaigning walking door to door the same thing im doing we dont normally start this early but he wanted an early start
1591065 it could take three or four years before getting something out of cheyenne on this
1591066 the only influence i would have as a commissioner on the treasurers office is in setting the budget
1591067 nobody said it was illegal but it has the appearance of not having an arms length relationship
1591068 i suppose it could at least give the appearance of that
1591069 i will not take part in nasty politics and bad mouthing people
1591070 we could look at it in a positive light and i guess you could kind of work with the public forum and ask what the public thinks our needs are i would encourage them to be positive
1591071 reasonable planning and sustainable growth and good jobs for our children if they decide to stay
1591072 if we lose our rural lifestyle we have lost it all for park county
1591073 i would continue to work with the planning department to control growth and i agree we need to improve jobs here
1591074 since 1999 our countys assessed value went from 250 million to 779 million for 2008 almost tripling in property value we may not be the next jackson but were on our way
1591075 fight tooth and nail not to ever become a jackson
1591076 i dont want us to be in a position where people in our community cant afford to work in the community
1591077 i really enjoy my job as a commissioner and i think ive been a good commissioner working well with other elected officials i would like to work for you for four more years
1591078 i dont pretend to have all the answers to the complex issue within park county but i do know how to get things done
1591079 people that know me know im not afraid to get my hands dirty
1591080 ive been a taxpayer and citizen and worked hard at my job
1591081 one of the reasons that im doing this is because i have not been hugely active and i feel guilty about that
1591082 i feel like i have a little bit of experience in a lot of different areas and my promise is that i can be a good listener im a quick study
1591083 im running on a platform that im a working class representative
1591084 im not asking for sympathy im asking for reality and i will consider this when making decisions
1591085 i am sure there are pensioners out there who would be delighted to earn a few extra quid and at the same time keep their street clean and tidy
1591086 i think we have to take a new approach to cleaning up our neighbourhoods
1591087 one way might be for local authorities to employ pensioners for a few hours each week to keep their own street and alley clean and free of weeds
1591088 the ditch is in a disgusting state and steve barber from sheppey noise has kindly agreed to bring a group of volunteers along to help clean it out
1591089 it would be really helpful if local residents could turn up and help with the clean up the more people who turn up the more we can get done personally i would like to be able to clear out the canal because it is once again looking pretty awful
1591090 last year local residents helped scap get loads of rubbish from the canal and it is extremely disappointing to see that people are still throwing rubbish into what is a wonderful local amenity sometimes i despair
1591091 i simply cannot fathom out the mentality of those who think it is clever or funny to throw shopping trolleys and other rubbish into the canal such behaviour harms our local environment this way and is the height of stupidity
1591092 our outlook from may remains unchanged due to the continuing market volatility we reiterate that without accounting for the tax gain it could be very difficult to reach the good result of the previous year in 2008
1591093 while we have some issues with the cameras shooting performance mainly with the ridiculous buffer flush times this camera still offers great image quality awesome high iso performance nice video results and a very intelligent and useful smart capture mode
1591094 over the years epson has established enduring relationships with world renowned photographers
1591095 this dialogue gives us insight on how to improve our technology to better meet pro photographers needs in the field the epson p 6000 and p 7000 are products of this relationship and cater not only to professional photographers but also advanced amateurs and photo enthusiasts with a range of valuable features
1591096 epsons multimedia photo viewer is critical to my work the screen is gorgeous the fidelity color and brightness are superb knowing my images are backed up helps me sleep at night halfway around the world
1591097 the s1000fds exposure and image processing are consistently and dependably accurate in virtually any sort of outdoor lighting but there is a slight tendency toward over exposure and occasional burnt out highlights images shot between iso 64 to iso 200 have acceptably low noise levels but noise starts to pick up slightly iso 200 and iso 400 shots show some minor loss of detail
1591098 cleaner shots from the fuji combined with more consistent af lock in low light than the sp 570 provides make the finepix the clear winner for ultrazoom users needing a fairly competent low light camera and this distinction alone is enough to pull the s8100fd into the lead where image quality is concerned
1591099 image quality from the sp 570 is excellent indoors and out
1591100 images shot at iso 64 to iso 200 have extremely low noise levels and are dependably very good to excellent with accurate colors decent shadow detail and acceptable highlight detail and accurate caucasian skin tones
1591101 it can put me on my way and i do feel like that
1591102 im a believer that winning builds confidence and doing things right and doing things well builds confidence

1591105 during the second quarter our clinical development programs continued to advance in addition we were pleased to announce that pfizer had initiated a phase i study with our vr1 receptor antagonist one of the programs acquired with renovis with this acquisition we achieved an important milestone in our strategic transformation into a biopharmaceutical company four clinical candidates are now backed by a strong late stage preclinical pipeline and we are well positioned to partner key clinical programs with pharmaceutical companies partnering discussions with our lead compound evt 201 for the treatment of insomnia are ongoing insomnia continues to be a difficult area for any partnering activities in particular following the recent challenges faced by gaboxadol indiplon and others however the co development agreement announced by actelion in july demonstrates that there is continued interest in this indication from the market successful partnering is our key objective as it is of significant importance to create value for our shareholders from both our discovery engine and our in licensed products
1591106 what would a bomb fallout shelter for the climate crisis be like shelters were an exceptional practice erected quickly by the civic sector and a very local response to an uncertain collective threat they remain as icons of a sort of the mobilization that achieved with the urgency and exceptional conditions of the war and provide a comparison to the contemporary civic responses climate crisis such as change your lightbulb drive at the speed limit buy local lettuce who designed built funded and deployed those shelters for whom and what would one look like now one that addressed the contemporary threats
1591107 the environmental health clinic at nyu is a clinic and lab modeled on other health clinics at universities
1591108 the clinic works like this you make an appointment just like you would at a traditional health clinic to talk about your particular environmental health concerns what differs is that you walk out with a prescription not for pharmaceuticals but for actions local data collection and urban interventions directed at understanding and improving your environmental health plus referrals not to medical specialists but to specific art design and participatory projects local environmental organizations and local government or civil society groups organizations that can use the data and actions prescribed as legitimate forms of participation to promote social change

1591113 why nick what ever inspired you to post this blog clearly your best youve ever written
1591114 i have learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much
1591115 i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period for me
1591116 i hope next season will not be so unlucky with injuries but at the moment i just do not want to think about that the negative stuff if you think positive you get positive
1591117 my target is to be as fit as possible after a month because the season is long we have to build it all up slowly with gym work cardio work and games it is really important for me to get a good start
1591118 last year we had a really good pre season and won almost every game
1591119 then after 50 seconds against fulham on the opening day we were behind so it is hard to predict but hopefully we can get some confidence out of the first few games and slowly build it up
1591120 for every team it is really important to get that confidence if you lose the first few games you are not at your maximum it is important to win to get the answers to the questions
1591121 i think any of the top four can win the title i am not going to say we are going to win it because you never know they do not know we do not know either but i hope we can
1591122 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening then everyone is really disappointed
1591123 but i am certainly committed to winning it and if you look around so is everyone here

1591152 it is not important if the numbers of participates are large
1591153 as long as the numbers are coming from different locations around the world we do know that malalai joya has strong supporters in the western world as well as europe this action can demonstrate the worlds solidarity in helping malalai
1591154 malalai joya is a staunch defender of human rights and a powerful voice for afghan women and she shouldnt have been suspended from parliament the afghan parliament should be setting an example by promoting and protecting free expression not by stamping it out
1591155 in enemies of happiness which follows the intense final weeks of malalai joyas successful election campaign to the afghan parliament joya uses the democratic political process to advocate for womens rights amid death threats from powerful politicians opposed to her candidacy ironically in may 2007 just after the film was completed the afghan parliament voted to suspend joya from her seat citing a rule forbidding members from criticizing each other joya is a vocal critic of afghan parliamentarians who have ties to northern alliance warlords
1591156 two activist women recently have been killed in their houses they were journalists shakiba amaj and also zakia zaki and most of the people in afghanistan they have education problem health problem that is how much education is important
1591157 i hope by being a member of parliament i will be able to serve my people
1591158 i will do my best to stop the warlords and criminals from building any laws that will jeopardize the rights of afghan people especially the women
1591159 please let us know if you manage to organize even a little event in your country so we can communicate to the media
1591160 we are asking all supporters of malalai joya to organize for june 21 sit ins and demonstrations in front of embassies diplomatic afghan premises local government premises un premises etc with pictures of malalai joya and signs which denounce the situation
1591161 the most important thing is to take pictures or even movies so these can be sent to the office of the defense committee for malalai joya
1591162 it is only in exile that i am free to speak my lifes joys and sorrows
1591163 a moving testimony which serves to further international awareness and understanding
1591164 the story of a woman who sustained her human dignity integrity and compassion in the face of immense degradation and suffering both compelling and inspiring
1591165 the right to life is the most important of all human rights legally guaranteed and protected by contemporary international law on the other hand the right to life is the one which is most of all connected to and dependent on proper protection of the human environment we cannot forget that this is an original right from which all other human rights derive
1591166 concern about the situation of the environment including industrial accidents and their impact on womens health
1591167 without grassroots ownership of the important issue of gender empowerment the chinese government cannot build meaningful partnership with both local and international actors to form useful solutions for the advancement of women
1591168 fundamentally the lack of access to transparent information undermines government accountability and prevents domestic civil society actors ordinary citizens and the media from effectively contributing to the promoting of womens rights in china
1591169 our tibetan and uyghur colleagues have documented the persecution of tibetan nuns and adverse effects of chinas family planning policies on tibetan and uyghur women
1591170 the china report however does not examine the situation of minority women except in very general terms and collapses minority areas alongside poor and rural areas
1591171 i am free now there are no guards outside my door there is enough to eat yet an exile can never forget the severed roots of beginnings the precious fragments of which are always within the heart as i pass through the hours of each day i feel my memories remains with the memories of my family and friends whose bones have become part of a land now tread by strangers
1591172 there was no choice but for me to make this journey
1591173 somehow i have survived a witness to the voices of my dying compatriots my family and friends those i once knew are gone and i have given them my solemn promise that somehow their lives will not be wiped out forgotten and confused within a web of history that has been rewritten by those who find it useful to destroy the memory of many i have known and loved fulfilling this promise is the only purpose remaining in my life
1591174 in view of the grave situations faced by tibetan women in tibet we urge the chinese authorities to invite the councils special rapporteur on violence against women on an official fact finding mission which will include an extensive program in tibetan areas of present day china
1591175 join hands with the women of the world to promote peace and justice for all
1591176 the largest effort in the world of men working to end mens violence against women
1591177 i believe that we must see mens violence as the result of a breakdown of patriarchy of entitlement thwarted again and again what the research on rape on domestic violence finds is that men initiate violence when they feel a loss of power to which they felt entitled
1591178 this question of entitlement lies at the heart of current controversies over sex trafficking all over the world
1591179 a personal pledge never to commit condone nor remain silent about violence against women
1591180 providing services drafting and lobbying for legislation raising awareness through advocacy education and training and building national regional and international end violence networks
1591181 at least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her violence against women and girls is a universal problem of epidemic proportions perhaps the most pervasive human rights violation that we know today it devastates lives fractures communities and stalls development
1591182 the path starts with listening who knows better about violence against women than women who experience it
1591183 domestic violence is a worldwide epidemic studies show that between one quarter and one half of all women in the world have been abused by intimate partners worldwide 40 70 of all female murder victims are killed by an intimate partner
1591184 we dont think that men are naturally violent and we dont think that men are bad
1591185 the majority of men are not violent researchers have discovered many past cultures with little or no violence
1591186 at the same time we do think that many men have learned to express their anger or insecurity through violence many men have come to believe that violence against a woman child or another man is an acceptable way to control another person
1591187 today in the united states despite remarkable advances in technology social justice and education violence continues to be a permeating and pervasive element of american society we are bathed in violent images violence fascinates and repulses us
1591188 if children are ignored poorly educated and not protected from violence they will grow into adults that create a reactive non creative and violent society
1591189 parents caregivers professionals public officials and policy makers do have the capacity to make decisions that will increase or decrease violence in our childrens lives
1591190 there are forms of emotional violence from sexist joking to sexual harassment at work to other domineering forms of behavior
1591191 by remaining silent about these things we allow other men to poison our working and learning environments
1591192 if we all think about the concept of the white ribbon in our lives daily the commitment to never commit condone or remain silent about violence against women we will be on our way to truly making a difference
1591193 the feminist transformation of society is a revolution in progress for nearly two centuries we men have met insecurity by frantically shoring up our privilege or by running away these strategies have never brought us the security and the peace we have sought perhaps now as men we can stand with women and embrace the rest of this revolution embrace it because of our sense of justice and fairness embrace it for our children our wives our partners and ourselves
1591194 we need to encourage more women to become involved in political life and we need to ensure that candidates are in winnable seats
1591195 unlocking the desire for peace would never have been enough all the energy all the determination to express an overwhelming demand for an end to the sickening cycle of useless violence would have reverberated briefly and despairingly among the people as had happened so many times before if we had not organized ourselves to use that energy and that determination positively once and for all
1591196 half of the population is not fairly represented in the decision making process and this cannot be right
1591197 peace is not without sacrifice and it should thus be remembered
1591198 we are going to have to work for a peaceful world continuously without stopping because differences exist among people they exist in families they exist within nations and they will exist in the world and therefore without any question you are going to have to work to achieve peace in the world much more continuously than you have ever worked
1591199 many of our people i think have never faced the fact that the real struggle in the world today is not just a struggle of power of military power it is a struggle of economic and cultural power and we will have to study and meet the other forces in the world that think differently than the way we do
1591200 actually as far as world peace is concerned you will achieve steps you will prevent wars you will begin to find methods which you will use for instance now we face the question of disarmament now if you will do away with force youve got to find something to take its place and what are you going to have to take its place law thats alright thats an awfully nice thing to just say but when you set to work to really build world law youve got quite a lot to do and this is just one of the things that has to happen if youre going to come to real disarmament which is the only way of insuring world peace and it also means of course that there must be total membership in the united nations everybody must be under the same rules you cant leave one great nation armed outside when the others are all disarmed and under the same rules
1591201 you cannot do away with military armaments til youve built something to take the place of force and so theres a long way before us and the united nations is becoming more important everyday because its only through the united nations that you can take these steps that you can really achieve the objectives that ultimately we want to achieve
1591202 this is the only machinery we have if people of different backgrounds of different religions work together they do achieve results and sometimes very impressive results
1591203 im particularly moved by his belief that women are the caretakers and educators of our future citizens and society
1591204 i have always believed that women have a unique role in society
1591205 women have a special capacity to lead us to a more peaceful world with compassion affection and kindness and there is no more important time for that than this moment
1591206 friendliness means that one develops amity toward all beings and this counteracts feelings of hatred
1591207 compassion is developed when seeing the sufferings of others so that one wishes to share their troubles and to help them this being opposed to the attitude of callous indifference
1591208 you need tremendous will power and determination right from the start accepting that there will be many obstacles and resolving that despite them all you will continue until you have attained your goal
1591209 it is the nature of human beings to yearn for freedom equality and dignity if we accept that others have a right to peace and happiness equal to our own do we not have a responsibility to help those in need all human beings whatever their cultural or historical background suffer when they are intimidated imprisoned tortured or discriminated against the question of human rights is so fundamentally important that there should be no difference of views on this
1591210 weneed to cultivate a universal responsibility for one another and the planet we share
1591211 our rich diversity of cultures and tradition should help to strengthen fundamental human rights in all communities mere tradition can never justify violations of human rights thus discrimination against persons of a different race against women and against weaker sections of society may be traditional in some places but because they are inconsistent with universally recognized human rights these forms of behavior should change the universal principle of the equality of all human beings must take precedence
1591212 when i look at birds and animals their survival is without rules without conditions without organization but mothers take good care of their offspring thats nature in human beings also parents particularly mothers and children have a special bond mothers milk is a sign of this affection we are created that way the childs survival is entirely dependent on someone elses affection so basically each individuals survival or future depends on society
1591213 remembering the kind influence of my own mother i pray that women working for inner peace and through that peace in the world may be blessed with success
1591214 in studies conducted in many of the counties of liberia in 2004 a large percentage of women and girls reported that they were victims of various forms of violence and abuse international organization reports show that a large percentage of these women were raped
1591215 in 1985 after challenging the military regimes failure to register my political party i was put in jail with several university students who also challenged the military rule this house came to our rescue with a resolution threatening to cut off aid to the country unless all political prisoners were released months later i was put in jail again this time in a cell with 15 men all of them were executed a few hours later only the intervention of a single soldier spared me from rape
1591216 ensure that women and girls receive real protection from sexual abuse
1591217 i stand before you today as the first woman elected to lead an african nation thanks to the grace of almighty god thanks to the people of west africa and of africa generally who continued to give hope to my people
1591218 in the campaign months i traveled to every corner of our country i trudged through mud in high boots where roads did not exist or had deteriorated past repair i surveyed ruined hospitals and collapsed clinics i held meetings by candlelight because there is no electricity anywhere including the capital except from private generators i was forced to drink water from creeks and un sanitized wells all of which made me vulnerable to the diseases from which so many of our people die daily i came face to face with the human devastation of war which killed a quarter of a million of our three million people and displaced most of the rest hundreds of thousands escaped across borders more who could not fled into the bush constantly running from one militia or another often surviving by eating rodents and wild plants that made them sick and even killed them our precious children died of malaria parasites and mal nourishments our boys full of potential were forced to be child soldiers to kill or be killed our girls capable of being anything they could imagine were made into sex slaves gang raped by men with guns made mothers while they were still children themselves but listening to the hopes and dreams of our people i recall the words of a mozambican poet who said our dream has the size of freedom my people like your people believe deeply in freedom and in their dreams they reach for the heavens i represent those dreams i represent their hope and their aspirations i ran for president because i am determined to see good governance in liberia in my lifetime but i also ran because i am the mother of four and i wanted to see our children smile again already i am seeing those smiles for even after everything they have endured the people of liberia have faith in new beginnings they are counting on me and my administration to create the conditions that will guarantee the realization of their dreams all the children i meet when i ask what they want most say i want to learn i want to go to school i want an education we must not betray their trust young adults who have been called our lost generation do not consider themselves lost they too aspire to learn and to serve their families and their communities we must not betray their trust women my strong constituency tell me that they want the same chances that men have they want to be literate they want their work recognized they want protection against rape they want clean water that wont sicken and kill their children we must not betray their trust
1591219 acts of violence usually murder committed by male family members against female family members who are perceived to have brought dishonor upon the family
1591220 honor killings seem to be excused by the words culture and tradition but nothing should sit above justice and law if a country is to be considered contemporary or developed the honor killings in europe are a problem as well
1591221 we have been working on the killings for a long time all of us all of the womens organizations
1591222 we have been writing articles in the papers in magazines
1591223 it just does not seem to go anywhere when this recent killing in bashika happened i think it woke us all up to realizing look if we do not do something this is going to continue and its going to get worse
1591224 put simply how women fare in a society is an indicator of the direction that society is taking
1591225 sixty percent of all houses in bosnia and herzegovina half of the schools and a third of the hospitals were damaged or destroyed 70 percent of farm equipment and 60 percent of livestock were destroyed
1591226 in 2006 women for women international facilitated the exchange of more than 70 000 letters between sponsors and their sisters the stories the women share help to educate sponsors about the dynamics of conflict injustice and social exclusion while inspiring many to become active in their own communities on behalf of the women and the challenges they face
1591227 sherezada a 15 year old girl spoke in front of her mother and her mothers newfound friends
1591228 we want every home to be a zone of peace we want all forms of violence to cease
1591229 war is not healthy for children and other living things
1591230 we decided to send a mothers day card to washington
1591231 for my mothers day gift of this year i dont want any candy or flowers i want an end to killing we who have given life must be dedicated to preserving it please talk peace
1591232 most of all we want an end to economic violence exploitation and inequalities
1591233 this campaign will make visible the peace work of women which have kept communities alive which have created and protected lives in the face of extreme violence
1591234 this partnership campaign opens up great opportunities for debate learning and public advocacy
1591235 its not just my voice its everyones voice education is a human right and a foundation for a better life
1591236 lisa marie wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1591237 it is impossible to be unhappy while reading the adventures of jeeves and wooster and ive tried
1591238 when ian ashbee takes the armband for hull city this season he will have captained the club through all four divisions
1591239 has any other player achieved this in england or abroad
1591240 i believe the late joe kiernan captained northampton town in all four divisions way back in the 60s
1591241 i think he captained them in the second and then the first division then they were relegated right down year after year into the fourth division with joe still in charge
1591242 the captain of the swansea side who won promotion to the first division in the early 1980s
1591243 may have also played in the fourth division in the 1970s or after their subsequent relegation back down to the basement
1591244 when fiorentina were declared bankrupt in 2002 di livio was the only player to remain with the club or join the new club if you prefer when they were entered for serie c2 b
1591245 fiorentina won the league by a country mile and were promoted with a slight reorganisation of the league system in italy in 2003 a controversial decision placed fiorentina in serie b where they were also promoted at the first opportunity again with di livio as captain he remained in this role for his final season as a professional 2004 05 in serie a therefore di livio captained fiorentina in the fourth second and first divisions of italian football
1591246 who was the last player to score for england sporting a proper moustache
1591247 i think it was viv anderson but a friend of mine is convinced it was kenny sansom
1591248 i recall one episode of jimll fix it where a young lad asked jim to fix it for him to become a football referee
1591249 i cant remember the sides involved i suspect they were two sunday league sides the plucky young fellow had some link with one of the sides which showed in his refereeing as he sent all of the other side off
1591250 i remember four players forming a wall being sent off for not being 10 yards away from the free kick
1591251 which naturally had been awarded for a red card offence
1591252 in the gothenburg v malm game this saturday home defender ragnar sigurdsson accidentally headbutted malm goalie jonas sandqvist obviously manager roland nilsson yes ex coventry gaffer was reluctant to lose his goalie and referee martin hansson halted the game for 10 minutes to allow a local physio tailor to get both players sewn together has anyone ever had a longer spell of treatment and carried on playing

1591256 i remember tony book being something like 29 when he signed for manchester city but he may have been a pro in non league football before that
1591257 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1591258 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1591259 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1591260 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1591261 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1591262 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government
1591263 i detest what you write but i would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write
1591264 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1591265 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1591266 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1591267 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1591268 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1591269 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1591270 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1591271 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1591272 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1591273 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1591274 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1591275 i think that he had some problems with the terms of allowing animal control unlimited access to his property without warrants and allowing them to trap his dogs
1591276 we pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital
1591277 she was not glued she was not tied she was just physically stuck by her body

1591284 chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the uk
1591285 up to 70 per cent of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms and could therefore remain undiagnosed
1591286 this means that they are at huge risk of serious long term health complications including infertility and ectopic pregnancy
1591287 it seems like the main targets of this proposed new legislation are web sites offering unauthorized chaku uta ring tone or music downloads
1591288 the message they seem to want to bring across is that downloading from those sites is illegal
1591289 however although the scope of this legislation seems small its effect is huge it affects basically everything that we do on the net

1591305 only our individual faith in freedom can keep us free
1591306 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction
1591307 above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women it is a weapon our adversaries in todays world do not have
1591308 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

1591320 this is the only way youll see me from now on
1591321 i went out there and grabbed it and i was like oh my gosh that cant be gold it is and then i ran up to my dad and i showed him
1591322 i was like come one come all there has got to be more
1591323 i was going to go slew some gold to go to the senior prom and about second shovel a four ounce gold nugget rolled right in the tip of my shovel
1591324 i stuck it in my pocket and ran to town
1591325 we only know that he stopped and that there has to be a reason
1591326 he was examined and were going to know more after everyone has a chance to talk
1591327 and i need to do something more intense than i was on the days im not pitching its all to keep me healthy
1591328 well get him out there as much as we can but theres other guys competing so its not like its all about juan
1591329 just build his legs up and give him enough swings to see what kind of hitter hes going to be just about keeping his legs healthy
1591330 you take what you think is classic human nature and then you make exceptions if you have a guy
1591331 i think ank is going to take the same at bat wherever he goes
1591332 thats why i did it because the teams were struggling starting in 2000 we were winning enough that i didnt feel like it last year we struggled and when you struggle you do something different it still remains the same i think it gives you more chances to score
1591333 if there was one single motive it was probably money
1591334 if i was the same pitcher he knew when both were braves i would have struggled and been out of the rotation within a month
1591335 a pitcher is supposed to be a lion on the mound not a lamb i used to be a lamb
1591336 if he can do what he did last year and the year before then hes mentally tougher than the people who doubted him
1591337 im going to be the first one to say i thought they were making a big mistake taking him out of that relief role i was saying oh no and it worked
1591338 the goal should be to hold on until they get here what does that say about us if thats the case
1591339 duncan said hey you dont appear to be attacking the hitters you dont appear to be aggressive
1591340 as a pitcher that is the one thing that you want to portray to the hitters is that im aggressive im going to attack you and you better be ready to swing
1591341 if i dont look like it then i must not be aggressive
1591342 i have to be careful how i say this but it was one of the more regrettable trades weve ever done because the guy we got j d drew was here only one year im happy for wainwright all of sudden hes pushed to the front of the line
1591343 it was something i played with for a while but it gradually got worse
1591344 youve got to ease into everything with surgery its not the type of thing where you rest and then its good and all of a sudden you can go out and sprint its a gradual process
1591345 the night game before my back tightened up i felt like i was getting a lot closer
1591346 not playing in september then recovering from surgery left me feeling for my swing i was just trying to take consistently good swings slowing the ball down stuff like that
1591347 there were certain pitches i couldnt get to before that i feel like i can handle now
1591348 mark is my idol but hal is the person who sees me every day and has done the most to make me a better hitter
1591349 mark has helped me with the mental aspect of hitting but hal has done a lot to help me make adjustments and become a better hitter
1591350 when youre hurt sometimes you have a tendency to fall into some bad habits
1591351 im just trying to get back to where i was at the end of 06 and the start of 07
1591352 its tough for me to talk about because i wasnt doing good i felt like i was good enough to play and that i could help the team so i kept going out there
1591353 because i didnt play well it makes it tougher for me to talk about that it sounds pretty weak
1591354 it took a little while for my speed and agility to come back
1591355 i think im capable of doing what i did in the first half last year over a season
1591356 the thing for me is to get comfortable with my swing and stay healthy
1591357 i know everybody out there is going to say why keep playing
1591358 the window of opportunity is only so big and i realize im getting towards the end of that i still enjoy playing i still enjoy the whole experience of it
1591359 in the end i think it was hard to overcome the comfort factor in st louis
1591360 no 1 this is still about his ability what he has left
1591361 but he also adds a charge to the team on a different scale leadership wise even as a backup you can still have that influence at that position
1591362 more because of the mental aspect just because of the unknown of the concussion
1591363 all these concussion reports i kept reading on the internet and studies i kept reading in magazines his name was on a lot of those reports
1591364 i said just give me an impartial opinion what you think
1591365 thats the first thing you look at is finding players to fill those spots and compete and play at a championship level
1591366 then its time to start bringing guys who have redshirted and guys who have been in the program its time to start bringing them along and develop them and get as many of those players to play at the level it takes to win at a championship level
1591367 what we really try to do is look at ways to teach it better ways to execute it better and maybe some technique changes on how were coaching or trying to do certain things
1591368 but for the most part we do what we believe in and we just want to get better at what were doing
1591369 this hearing cost far more in tax dollars than my monitorship will cost because it did not cost taxpayers one thin dime

1591374 i am looking forward to working with western college to enable closer alignment of training to industry needs and most importantly better employment outcomes for people in western nsw
1591375 there are a number of areas where the two training organisations complement each other and there is potential for future partnerships to help match peoples skills with industry needs
1591376 resource sharing and pooling our initiatives will have the best outcome for the community
1591377 anything our organisations can do to enable more people to gain skills and take advantage of new opportunities for employment in various industries throughout the area will be welcomed
1591378 it taught us not to be afraid to stand out in a crowd to be proud of who we are
1591379 we learned leadership skills and made lots of friends even lifelong friends

1591403 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police

1591411 hell would have to freeze over for us to sell dean to a major rival
1591412 i was sitting with michael carrick and owen hargreaves and we said to each other that we wanted to go out and achieve it again as soon as possible rio ferdinand recalled yesterday
1591413 we just said we had to get back there again
1591414 i remember seeing the great clubs that won the european cup back to back
1591415 if we can win it again we can start talking about being a really great team as of now we are a team who have been successful but we still have a lot more to give the manager has spoken to us about it but he doesnt need to the players understand it anyway
1591416 we were very successful in the last two seasons and when you achieve these things it becomes an addiction
1591417 if you look in our youth team we have some very talented young guys fraizer campbell is getting headlines and has a good future jonny evans has done well at sunderland and there are a lot of clubs wanting to sign him danny welbeck has also done well and has a great future
1591418 i am not sure the talent is coming through as fast as it was watching the foreign teams and seeing the touch their kids possess and the way they take the ball its a lot different to our kids its just a comfort on the ball
1591419 we bring other things to the table in terms of desire energy and will to win so if we can marry the two together we will have a great mix
1591420 the game is much more of a business now when i was at west ham harry redknapp was putting three or four kids in every year dipping them in and out of the team would he do that now at portsmouth i dont think he would the risks are too great money wise
1591421 they want to get all the information they can out of you and see how you conduct yourself what you eat what you do
1591422 if some players go too far we can still recognise the benefits of a quiet word being applied but we also want referees to stand and deal with confrontation not back away

1591431 whats supposed to be the most happy occasion of your life has been ruined
1591432 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
1591433 the only thing that will get them to change their minds is public pressure
1591434 wrapit made me so angry and i cant believe the mess they have now left so many couples in whats supposed to be the most happy occasion of your life has been ruined
1591435 i now cant look at any of my wedding presents without thinking i hate wrapit thats not the way its supposed to be
1591436 if we hadnt complained as much as we did i feel positive we would be caught up in this mess now there are so many people who entered the process at the same time as us and now have nothing to show for it
1591437 up to 70 per cent of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms and could therefore remain undiagnosed
1591438 chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the uk
1591439 up to 70 per cent of people who have chlamydia have no symptoms and could therefore remain undiagnosed
1591440 this means that they are at huge risk of serious long term health complications including infertility and ectopic pregnancy
1591441 todays move means that symptom free people diagnosed with chlamydia and their partner will be able to get convenient effective treatment from their local pharmacy
1591442 adverse weather conditions and increased demand had kept local charcoal prices 20 percent higher than in the first quarter of the previous year
1591443 the shortage of supplies compelled the company to import charcoal incurring additional costs in the period reviewed and the weaker us dollar continued to adversely impact the companys profit

1591448 he is a pretty good player i think there would be 15 other clubs who would like a player of the quality of alan didak
1591449 we had in place special behavioural criteria as part of an existing contract and for a period of time he was bound by those
1591450 at the end of that period of time when we signed a new deal he was bound by the codes of every other player in the afl and he has breached those codes
1591451 one of the regrets is taking those boundaries away and maybe that sent the wrong message
1591452 they were calculated parameters and during that time his life was at a peak and in a lot of ways we started to turn him around
1591453 most of us were here from the early hours of the morning and its only in the last hour that its been resolved
1591454 due to hip injuries and now my shoulder the time has come where injuries have got the better of me and it is time to move on
1591455 i had an interrupted pre season and i ended up stewing on this decision pretty much all year
1591456 once i reached the decision the realisation was quite overwhelming
1591457 to be able to just sit and watch the boys in the derby at the weekend knowing that i was on the sidelines was actually quite a relief
1591458 the camaraderie and those times at training and at the club when you are just hanging with your mates thats what ill miss most
1591459 enrolment for another clinical phase iii study for laquinimod started during the period and complete phase ii data was published in the respected medical journal the lancet the planned interim analysis from the first part of the phase ii iii trial for the anyara cancer project presented positive data and the pivotal phase iii study commenced in may we now have two phase iii projects and three clinical phase ii projects consequently we have further strengthened active biotechs position as a company with a balanced and mature project portfolio
1591460 the list of fastest growing destinations is significant because young travellers often set the mainstream industry trends for the future south america is the hot destination this year and we have seen volume to destinations such as san jose and lima grow by as much as 39 over the last year
1591461 we have also seen changes in the way young people approach their travels more and more gap year travel is becoming shorter and better planned to get the most out of their time abroad the once carefree spontaneous year of travel is now a three to six month carefully researched trip often involving voluntary projects learning a skill and earning money along the way
1591462 the opportunity to present the results of the deep study at the isshps world congress reflects the considerable scientific and medical interest in this important study in pre eclampsia as this is the first time a drug has shown a clinical benefit towards improving an end organ function in pre eclamptic patients this study will advance efforts to identify the underlying cause s of this life threatening condition
1591463 we are delighted that the deep study results will be one of the leading presentations at this prestigious meeting discussions with key stakeholders about how to progress this important programme continue and we are encouraged by the interest shown in the programme to date we expect to give a further update on next steps towards the end of the year
1591464 as everyone who has been to a meeting knows they are very paper intensive events
1591465 each piece of paper used in a meeting has the equivalent carbon emissions of burning a 60w light bulb for 1 hour as such a meeting of 10 people will typically have emissions of around 1 6kg of co2 equivalent to driving a typical 4x4 for 6 miles
1591466 the meetingpod is a paperless electronic meeting system which is much more energy efficient than using paper and uses a fraction of the energy used by laptops it holds all the meeting information that each attendee can view on their separate meetingpod this means that they do not have to print agendas minutes from the last meeting or any other information relevant to that meeting even separate presentations can be viewed on the built in screen making meeting room tables more efficient and easier to layout and use
1591467 venues are starting to look at their corporate social responsibility policies very closely
1591468 by not having a strategy to reduce their carbon footprint many meeting and conference venues are telling us that they are starting to lose business
1591469 they have to show us a verification regime that we can trust this is a step by step process
1591470 i cant predict the north korean leaders decision making i dont know what he is going to do but i do know that the best way to solve this issue is for five other nations to be saying the exact same thing
1591471 it is going to require action on the leader of north koreas part it just doesnt automatically happen

1591481 one researcher recently reported that in december 2007 a record 10 billion videos were viewed online the largest us broadband provider says consumer broadband traffic on its network has doubled in the last two years alone and broadband customers are using 40 percent more bandwidth per year
1591482 more interesting than the data and high level inferences in this
1591483 wimaxcounts is a unique web based service that tracks wimax operator deployments and provides detailed information on the worldwide wimax ecosystem maravedis launched the service in may 2007 covering 100 wimax operator profiles across 36 countries today we are proud to announce that wimax counts currently profiles over 260 operators across 90 countries
1591484 i would say the 2 5ghz band is generating a lot of interest around the world for mobile deployments the lower the frequency band the better the propagation characteristics
1591485 even with an increase of more than 19 in wimax subscribers in the first quarter of 2008 operators are still waiting for the tipping point that will lead to acceleration of wimax adoption and deployments
1591486 the key factors mainly center on certification of mobile wimax equipment a reduction in cpe pricing and the emergence of a device ecosystem
1591487 of the 1 988 million broadband wireless subscribers in the world more than half of which are on a network using a proprietary broadband wireless network such as motorolas nextnet or canopy or alvarion or aperto networks pre wimax kits of the 602 000 customers on wimax gear 509 000 have fixed wimax service networks based on the ieee 802 16d standard while only 193 000 are using a true mobile wimax ieee 802 16e network and of those the vast majority 145 000 are on korea telecoms wibro network which gained certification under the wimax forum this year

1591496 een aanrader voor mensen die pas reiki 1 hebben gedaan je zult aan de hand van ervaringen die je in dit boek kunt lezen tot de conclusie komen dat het helemaal niet zo gek is dat je soms een tijd niets meer voelt of in eerste instantie helemaal niets voelt dat je een tijdje geen zin meer hebt in reiki dat je gaat twijfelen aan reiki enz enz
1591497 gewoon zijn zoals ik me voel jaren heb ik me laten leiden door mijn omgeving alles wat op mijn bordje werd gelegd ruimde ik op door de reiki voelde ik dat ik anders met mezelf om moest gaan ik voel me intens dankbaar dat ik zoveel door reiki ontvang de rust die ik door reiki ontvang kan ik naar mijn medemens uitstralen ik verbaas me soms nog over mezelf laatst zag ik een boom waarvan ik afgelopen winter dacht die is dood overal kwam toch weer jong groen uit onverwacht stond ik tegen de boom te praten
1591498 ik ben beter in balans evenwichtiger heb meer geduld slaap veel beter beheers mijzelf beter het is voor mijn gezin ook wel even slikken geweest zon verandering van arrogante klootzak tot iemand die probeert mensen te helpen probeert met ze te praten

1591501 thuiskomen in mezelf ik ben mezelf ook meer recht gaan doen of beter gezegd eindelijk recht gaan doen niet anderen hun belangen altijd maar laten prevaleren maar mijn eigen belangen niet alleen anderen hun grenzen erkennen en respecteren maar ook die van mijzelf anders gaan denken gaan leven alles eigenlijk anders heel geleidelijk aan ben ik gaan veranderen meer mezelf geworden hoe groter de beproeving die tot me kwam des te groter de les de waarde van de les die ik er uit leren mocht angsten loslaten verdriet pijn boosheid frustratie loslaten wel voelen maar ook weer laten gaan in de wetenschap dat die dingen gevoeld mochten worden maar mijn dag niet verder hoefden te kleuren ze dienden slechts om me opmerkzaam op iets te maken en wanneer ik opmerkzaam was gemaakt vloeide dat gevoel ook weg want het had zijn doel bereikt
1591502 bij mij is het besef gegroeid dat ik de macht over mijzelf heb dat ikzelf verantwoordelijk ben voor hoe ik dingen interpreteer dat ikzelf degene ben die een ander niet toe kan staan om mijn leven of stemming te verpesten een paar zinnetjes maar een proces van jaren
1591503 dat leren en het ervaren wat reiki met zich meebrengt dat gaat bij mij in vlagen een periode met veel reiki met veel inzichten ontdekken ontwikkelen et cetera en dan weer een periode van minder reiki meer bezig zijn met andere dingen zoals de tuin een konijnenren maken kittens grootbrengen de was doen boodschappen en ga zo maar door maar ook bij die dingen zit reiki

1591510 iran already stopped nuclear enrichment at the behest of europe for more than a year a reference to tehrans suspension of enrichment between late 2003 and mid 2005 to allow negotiations with the european union and what happened nothing
1591511 to place a verifiable cap on iranian enrichment and other nuclear capabilities well short of weaponization
1591512 the americans when they need the npt they talk about it when they dont need it they throw it away you dont do that with an international treaty
1591513 no evidence that iran was working actively to build nuclear weapons
1591514 with the shah we also came to the conclusion that iran was in great need of nuclear energy because our population was steadily growing and our gas and oil will run out thats why even though i was in the old regime i should be fair to the new regime because they are following the same line to speak frankly with its bellicose behavior the west is pushing iran towards nuclear weapons even if they dont want them now
1591515 the europeans say stop enrichment and well talk but the iranians already did that and nothing happened
1591516 at the time of the shah we signed contracts with both france and germany and even then they didnt deliver if i were in the current regime i wouldnt trust the west they dont even give iran civilian airplane parts which is costing hundreds of lives why should they believe that they will give them enriched uranium

1591623 ofcom considered that these breaches of the broadcasting code were very serious
1591624 in each of these cases the bbc deceived its audience by faking winners of competitions and deliberately conducting competitions unfairly
1591625 the investigations found that in some cases the production team had taken premeditated decisions to broadcast competitions and encourage listeners to enter in the full knowledge that the audience stood no chance of winning
1591626 in other cases programmes faced with technical problems made up the names of winners
1591627 overall ofcom found that the bbc failed to have adequate management oversight of its compliance and training procedures to ensure that the audience was not misled
1591628 although viewers and listeners paid the cost of their calls to take part in these competitions the bbc did not receive any money from the entries
1591629 ofcoms decisions today relate to cases considered by the bbc trust in 2007 which led to remedial action by the bbc and significant changes in the way the bbc compiles competitions and programmes
1591630 the trust regrets that these serious breaches by the bbc have led to a financial penalty being applied by ofcom and the loss of licence fee payers money as a result
1591631 we recognise that the penalty in these cases reflects that the breaches were serious deliberate and in some cases repeated
1591632 these editorial failures were serious and through our work we are confident they have been taken seriously by those involved
1591633 our concern now is ensuring that the highest editorial standards are maintained to safeguard the publics trust
1591634 we accept ofcoms findings we have taken these issues extremely seriously from the outset apologising to our audiences and putting in place an unprecedented action plan to tackle the issues raised
1591635 this includes a comprehensive programme of training for over 19 000 staff rigorous new technical protections new guidance to programme makers on the running of competitions and a strict new code of conduct
1591636 ofcom has recognised that neither the bbc nor any member of staff made any money from these serious editorial lapses
1591637 whilst we must never be complacent and must remain constantly vigilant audience research suggests the comprehensive action we have taken is rebuilding the trust of viewers and listeners
1591638 that means a proper and rigorous approach to testing so that everyone has a fair chance everyone has a fair go and that our athletes are on the same level playing field literally as everyone else
1591639 so the ioc has got a big responsibility on its hands to make sure that these games are as drug free as possible
1591640 on the border between two states we have higher crime rates than neighboring cities and wanted to protect our citizens by adding a high speed public safety and wireless video security network to increase the eyes on the street immediately following installation we already saw a decrease in crime as the network is a visible deterrent to theft and other crimes
1591641 we turned to ips and belair networks to deliver a truly mobile network that can stream video in moving police vehicles and to the headquarters we have been extremely pleased at the results and how it has improved productivity and efficiency after weeks of deployment
1591642 temple was looking to upgrade security and turned to the latest wireless innovations and we developed a highly flexible network to meet their requirements of reducing crime in key hotspots
1591643 after looking at competing solutions only belair networks was able to offer the mobility we were looking for meeting the citys requirement of supporting the high speed transmission of video footage and voice applications while traveling at highway speeds
1591644 innovative cities like temple are leading the charge by bringing next generation wireless technology to the brave men and women who keep their cities safe and these advances can also help make their work more efficient
1591645 we need to think of ways to bring wireless fidelity applications to the developing world so as to make use of unlicensed radio spectrum to deliver cheap and fast internet access

1591739 while an entertaining article for those lower on the chain of the internet it makes the ones a little bit higher in the hierarchy cringe a bit it makes the movie bootleggers stand with their mouth wide open that such information would be released to the general public it explains about there being double agents in these topsites guess what now every major topsite knows that there are security holes in their network and they start being a little more careful about who gets access and go back and check over the people who already have access

1591907 they took him off of steroids and that caused the problem
1591908 if you get a horse used to those for their recovery the benefits that provides for muscles and the things that steroids do for them and you take it off of it there is a letdown
1591909 and even though the horse wasnt on an abusive dose of steroids it could have still caused an effect that was certainly detrimental to them
1591910 if it had been on a year then off for six seven months his body would have been used to not having them
1591911 but because he quit them in that time frame theres this kind of letdown then i think thats certainly possible it was a mistake

1591926 oh its a big project plan so its sure to fail
1591927 without doubt id keep him hes 25 i think hes their best player by a mile
1591928 i dont condone what hes done but i would keep him why wouldnt you
1591929 theres 15 other clubs that would chase him and why are they any better to think that they could probably straighten him out
1591930 these players are so educated that has really shocked me theyve been just told and told and told
1591931 dids has ended up having to face the music over the last couple of years and unfortunately hes in that boat at the moment
1591932 whos more to blame in this instance the guy driving or the passenger is he guilty by association
1591933 he got into the car i understand he was in the wrong place at the wrong time but in the end if there was blame to be put on here i know who id be spanking moreso than the other
1591934 theres 15 other clubs that would take him on tomorrow and the ones that wouldnt take him on its because they couldnt probably provide the proper trade to get him across the line
1591935 that sized player and type player weve got plenty of so i think if were looking for a player from another club
1591936 he would very much like he said to see england before he died and spoke with much interest about the great things to be seen there when i told him of that chamber in the british museum wherein are preserved household memorials of a race that ceased to be thousands of years ago he was very attentive and it was not hard to see that he had a reference in his mind to the gradual fading away of his own people
1591937 he was a remarkably handsome man some years past forty i should judge with long black hair an aquiline nose broad cheek bones a sunburnt complexion and a very bright keen dark and piercing eye there were but twenty thousand of the choctaws left he said and their number was decreasing every day
1591938 a splendid hotel and were as handsomely lodged as though we had been in paris rather than hundreds of miles beyond the alleghanies
1591939 the interval after breakfast we devoted to riding through the town which is regular and cheerful the streets being laid out at right angles and planted with young trees the buildings are smoky and blackened from the use of bituminous coal but an englishman is well used to that appearance and indisposed to quarrel with it there did not appear to be much business stirring and some unfinished buildings and improvements seemed to intimate that the city had been overbuilt in the ardour of going a head and was suffering under the re action consequent upon such feverish forcing of its powers
1591940 looking far more like a dame school than any police establishment for this awful institution was nothing but a lazy good for nothing front parlour open to the street wherein two or three figures i presume the magistrate and his myrmidons were basking in the sunshine the very effigies of langour and repose it was a perfect picture of justice retired from business for want of customers her sword and scales sold off napping comfortably with her legs upon the table
1591941 here as elsewhere in these parts the road was perfectly alive with pigs of all ages lying about every direction fast asleep or grunting along in quest of hidden dainties i had always had a sneaking kindness for these odd animals and found a constant source of amusement when all others failed in watching their proceedings
1591942 and we went on board where we shortly afterwards had a new kind of visitor in the person of a certain kentucky giant whose name is porter and who is of the moderate height of seven foot eight inches in his stockings
1591943 he had a weakness in the region of the knees and a trustfulness in his long face which appealed even to five feet nine for encouragement and support he was only twenty five years old he said and had grown recently for it had been found necessary to make an addition to the legs in his inexpressibles at fifteen he was a short boy and in those days his english father and his irish mother had rather snubbed him as being too small of stature to sustain the credit of his family he added that his health had not been good though it was better now but short people are not wanting who whisper that he drinks too hard
1591944 christened the little rifle and displayed outside a shop window it would make the fortune of any retail business in holborn when he had shown himself and talked a little while he withdrew with his pocket instrument and went bobbing down the cabin among men of six feet high and upwards like a lighthouse among lamp posts
1591945 wed lost many times to transport utd but we learned from our mistakes and came prepared to play this final
1591946 the purpose is to document our entire process of democracy up to the parliamentary elections and for historical reference
1591947 it was also found that 10 of voters did not know how many parties were involved and another 40 did not know that there would be an elimination round in case of more then two parties
1591948 there were also pockets of people in sangay ngedups and jigmi singyes constituencies who assumed that even if the two former ministers lost the local elections they would still be appointed ministers
1591949 we also found that among the parties pdp ended up spending more money then dpt

1591951 we were able to convince leaders on the appropriateness and the merit of bhutan as the venue
1591952 there will be floating of equities and its possible that banks like adb and world bank may participate were talking about a major financial institution here
1591953 wed like to start working on the framework immediately come to an agreement on how it should function
1591954 the institution arrangements that have to be put in place and how the funding will be organized well do it by employing experts within the country as well as consulting those of member states
1591955 aside from contributing to the saarc process the bank itself being located in bhutan will create many employment opportunities as well as help in establishing bhutan as a major financial centre
1591956 the saarc leaders were unanimous in coming to an agreement on his majestys proposal and accepting bhutan as the venue for the sdf
1591957 they were paying tribute to his majesty and also welcoming bhutan as a democracy
1591958 these were examples all the leaders admired and so sdf was in a way a gift to young democratic bhutan
1591959 this was something his majesty foresaw many years ago and its now for us to ensure that its realised

1592018 dot should not be taking action to increase flights at newark liberty when congestion there has continued to worsen despite the imposition of caps on flight operations
1592019 moreover dot doesnt have the legal authority to conduct auctions which will get tied up in litigation by a broad spectrum of opponents who are focused on solving congestion
1592020 every day huge amounts of fuel are wastefully burned and thousands of passengers are inconvenienced due to delays and congestion at liberty and in the new york airspace
1592021 auctions of flight operations are nothing more than an illegal taking and a disguised tax and will do nothing to reduce delays and congestion

1592041 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1592042 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
1592043 instead of calling on his partys leadership to return to congress and carve out an all of the above approach to americas energy crisis barack obama would rather tell commuters to inflate their car tires
1592044 you remember george bushs energy policy which was basically to turn to dick cheney and say here dick
1592045 and so dick in his inestimable wisdom decided hed meet with the renewable energy groups once and then hed meet with the oil and gas companies 40 times and so not surprisingly the laws he came up with were very good for the oil and gas companies but they werent so good for you
1592046 senator mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook hes offered a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1592047 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into

1592095 sen obama has said expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote
1592096 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
1592097 supports safe and secure nuclear energy however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1592098 i saw sen obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions
1592099 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it sen obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1592100 i think all of us sometimes choose to hear what we want to hear
1592101 but under the parameters we were given for the federal law we didnt have a choice
1592102 it was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds
1592103 virtually none of the evidence we wanted to present was presented
1592104 in that sense its not that surprising that the jury came to the decision it did
1592105 were pleased with the fact that the jury followed the law

1592107 the white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
1592108 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohamed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
1592109 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort

1592111 embargoes are contrivances designed not to protect the contents of the book but to create a media feeding frenzy when a book comes out often the entire purpose is to protect some kind of exclusive arrangement with a particular news outlet thats not about news its about publicity and it implicates the news media as part of the publicity juggernaut reducing us watchdogs to lap dogs

1592130 the bottom line is the criminal justice system is based on accountability and consequences
1592131 by allowing authorities to assign inmates to appropriate methods of serving their sentences these new provisions have the potential to eliminate the necessity to release inmates early thereby increasing their personal accountability and enhancing public safety

1592133 we are getting an increased volume of calls from people of all ages who are short financially
1592134 but we are seeing a very definite increase among seniors
1592135 they are asking for assistance with things like utility bills food closet referrals free transportation and housing they are having some type of emergency in their lives and the issue usually is money
1592136 people are complaining to me that theyre just not making it
1592137 this economy is hard on everyone but it is really hard on seniors right now
1592138 their incomes are fixed when things keep going up and up what do you do
1592139 i like the idea of free beans and rice at a food bank because it seems like every time you go to the grocery store things are up 10 cents or 15 cents
1592140 i dont waste trips sometimes ill park the car and take a bus
1592141 you just have to change your philosophy of living you have to change your habits
1592142 these are people whose incomes are very limited and are not rising with the cost of food fuel and medicine
1592143 what we often hear from clients these days is that they are having to pick and choose what they can pay for
1592144 are asking themselves whether their medications are more important than their other everyday expenses its a tough call for them but they are having to make those choices
1592145 the story on the first asian americans who moved here to build the transcontinental railroad and moved the waters in this delta to grow chinese pears in courtland and help california feed the world
1592146 when they finished building the railroads and got kicked out of the mines they knew how to build levees and grow crops
1592147 we dont really have a place we can bring chinese tourists unless you take them to locke
1592148 in the neighborhood of 6 000 per visitor per trip including 3 000 4 000 a person on hotels food and rental cars
1592149 sacramento will be one of the top destinations given the depth and breadth of our history and the cache of our governor and the capital
1592150 now if you do it yourself you have to have a relative here or some business or you can get an invitation from a university
1592151 the change is only for tour groups through some qualified travel agency but its a good first step
1592152 she was really influential in using a more eclectic approach
1592153 beth had beautiful eyes and a beautiful smile but she was never one to put on airs
1592154 there was no artifice about her she was a person of great integrity
1592155 if people dont pay attention before they know it there are not going to be any wild horses
1592156 horses are supposed to be protected if people dont pay attention before they know it there are not going to be any wild horses and i think thatll be a great loss
1592157 the bottom line is weve run out of things to do with these animals
1592158 there are pros and cons to each method but were not at that point
1592159 the potential for wholesale killing of thousands of healthy wild horses marks a complete turnaround in management policy
1592160 living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west
1592161 to set the record straight euthanasia is mercy killing thats certainly not whats being proposed here by any stretch of the imagination
1592162 its killing pure and simple to balance the books for an agency whose reckless management has caused immeasurable harm to a national treasure
1592163 is a long standing concern and must not be used as a death sentence
1592164 but it definitely sends a message to the guys on the street who want to live this lifestyle
1592165 it would be naive to say its the end of the trigga mob its part of that pervasive mind set out there that we constantly battle
1592166 who invested a tremendous amount of their time during the summer
1592167 they typify the type of gangsters who use violence and intimidation and if it means killing somebody theyre happy to do it
1592168 from my conversations with detectives he was the original suspect in that case
1592169 i can only say i am disappointed at the results
1592170 these compounds are quite stable and dont destroy organic compounds
1592171 this is an important piece in the puzzle and it is neither good nor bad for life
1592172 i had to go straight back to the textbooks to figure out what this material is
1592173 the interesting thing is perchlorate is a relatively inert oxidant
1592174 there are some microbes that use it as an energy source
1592175 depending on how much of it there is and where it is there could be widespread implications
1592176 its just as if it opened up a whole new research chapter for us
1592177 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1592178 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1592179 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1592180 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1592181 when you see big changes like that i think youre seeing more of a change in how adults are scoring the test than a change in how kids are learning
1592182 last year a lot of them made it this year they didnt
1592183 the scores reflect one data point along a spectrum of data points they dont tell the story of our schools or our students
1592184 that shows us where kids are and what theyre learning and thats more important than one test at the end of the year
1592185 we will study the results as an academic community to try to figure out which areas we need to bolster
1592186 my contention is that its such a snapshot and an inaccurate way of measuring a schools performance
1592187 if the state had stayed at 82 percent wed be really scratching our heads
1592188 we are concerned and we are going to address it
1592189 you try to go out and identify areas that need to be addressed districtwide and at individual schools
1592190 we look at each school we look at the district we look at the state
1592191 i believe the public wants a high school diploma to mean something and the public wants our high school students to be motivated
1592192 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
1592193 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
1592194 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred

1592205 even now i have my finger on the button of a device that can make the borders and all the cities of israel vanish in seconds
1592206 reward iranian goodwill gestures with stirring laudatory speeches and punish irans violations of u n resolutions with bold rhetorical rebukes
1592207 we know that president ahmadinejad wants to see israel wiped off the face of the map
1592208 of course the first step in negotiating is to determine what the other party wants that you might be able to provide
1592209 during the obama administration our words will mean that we are saying things by combining those words into sentences to express ideas about how we feel using dramatic phrases and dynamic cadences iran must never question our resolve to deliver speeches

1592261 when ian ashbee takes the armband for hull city this season he will have captained the club through all four divisions
1592262 has any other player achieved this in england or abroad
1592263 i believe the late joe kiernan captained northampton town in all four divisions way back in the 60s
1592264 i think he captained them in the second and then the first division then they were relegated right down year after year into the fourth division with joe still in charge
1592265 the captain of the swansea side who won promotion to the first division in the early 1980s
1592266 may have also played in the fourth division in the 1970s or after their subsequent relegation back down to the basement
1592267 when fiorentina were declared bankrupt in 2002 di livio was the only player to remain with the club or join the new club if you prefer when they were entered for serie c2 b
1592268 fiorentina won the league by a country mile and were promoted with a slight reorganisation of the league system in italy in 2003 a controversial decision placed fiorentina in serie b where they were also promoted at the first opportunity again with di livio as captain he remained in this role for his final season as a professional 2004 05 in serie a therefore di livio captained fiorentina in the fourth second and first divisions of italian football

1592271 i recall one episode of jimll fix it where a young lad asked jim to fix it for him to become a football referee

1592287 stateless computing isnt about having no state its kind of a misnomer its about where that state is stored since the emergence of the pc in the early 80s we have stored the state on the physical computer and that has presented a myriad of challenges that has driven it costs through the roof
1592288 the key to this is the version the idea is to put everything you view whether its an application or library you put it into this file system so therefore you never have this problem of an it industry created problem of the software stack
1592289 if you placed every little thing that you had a config file everything into a version name space and then you were able to build your applications against that and all the dependencies for applications were referable in this file system there would be no need to ever build a stack because every application would inherently know what its dependents were and would all be retrievable through this global file system
1592290 each flower gives the honey a distinct flavor and color
1592291 if bees visit orange blossoms the honey has one flavor if they visit clover it will taste entirely different
1592292 weve found that honey bees actually have preferences for example if they are in an alfalfa field with an almond orchard nearby they will fly right past the alfalfa because they prefer almond flowers but if alfalfa is the only nectar source they will go to the alfalfa field

1592321 the depth of the anger in clintons circle became clear friday when mccains chief strategist compared his candidate to bill clinton and the clintons seemed to accept the analogy
1592322 say whatever you want about bill clinton but its deeply unfair to suggest his criticism of obama was race based
1592323 we knew it was coming in our direction because they did it against a president of the united states of their own party
1592324 i think the mccain camp watched our primary on the democratic side very carefully and they know that any accusation of racial divisiveness can be very very harmful for a candidates prospects
1592325 according to the survey neither presumptive democratic presidential nominee barack obama nor republican presidential nominee john mccain has secured a clear majority of women who have decided every presidential election since 1968 obama garnered 49 to mccains 38 and 6 of these women said they were only leaning toward a candidate with 90 days to go until election day 10 of women are firmly undecided indicating either candidate has a shot at becoming the next president hillary clintons legacy hillarys women supporters while the majority of women who voted for hillary in the primary are flocking to obama 76 nearly one out of five 18 says they will vote for mccain for president

1592330 studies have shown that microbes can survive the shock levels of being launched into space
1592331 and as more and more organisms are discovered under extreme conditions its become more plausible that things could survive in space for the time it takes to go from one planet to another
1592332 one hundred years ago people wondered if animals could go from one land mass to another
1592333 everything that is going on on earth occurred because the meteorites happened to land here but they are obviously landing in other places
1592334 if there is another planet that has the water and all of the things that are needed for life you should be able to get the same process rolling

1592343 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1592344 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1592345 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1592346 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1592347 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1592348 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1592349 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1592350 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1592351 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1592352 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1592353 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1592354 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1592355 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery

1592374 i just went out there and tried to focus on the mitt as much as possible and keep my mind down in the zone i came in here knowing that they were probably going to take pitches on me because im a rookie coming into a big stadium so i really tried to pound the zone
1592375 i dont care how much of a scouting report you have when you step in the box the ball is moving its different than words
1592376 he didnt throw the offspeed stuff until the second time around he threw all fastballs and one changeup the first time around he knew what he was doing
1592377 i told him to just stay in the hotel and dont come to the ballpark because ive got to make a move after the game and i really dont want people to start looking over their shoulder seeing which guys going to go
1592378 i think the consensus of opinion was that he wasnt given an adequate opportunity to prepare himself to come here
1592379 thats like asking if on halloween theyre going to have trick or treat
1592380 nancy pelosi has said no to a vote on a comprehensive energy bill
1592381 i find it incredible that the american public cant hear whats going on in the house of representatives because nancy pelosi chose to turn off the lights and microphones rather than have an up or down vote on a comprehensive energy plan
1592382 shes jetting around this country shes on a five week vacation the american people cant afford a vacation many of them nancy pelosi needs to call this house back into session and we need an up or down vote on energy policy
1592383 madam speaker what are you afraid of give us a vote
1592384 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1592385 it was pretty exciting to get on the floor to see it live
1592386 i like the idea that republican house members are raising the questions i think energy is very important to the american people right now
1592387 i was surprised there was no media coverage there were no cameras on so people can understand whats going on in our government
1592388 my understanding is that its going to be 50 miles out and not something that is obtrusive on nature in terms of the environment so im for it
1592389 house speaker nancy pelosi has the power to shut off microphones and still video cameras

1592395 barack obamas suggestion that we cant drill our way out of the current energy shortage but we can solve the problem through tire inflation has been the source of much hilarity
1592396 ive never seen such a huge chip on the shoulder take offense mentality and i think the majority of the american people is getting increasingly sick of it

1592427 they are being exposed to sex and to talk about sex before theyre even old enough to even think about having sex
1592428 young people who watch a lot of sexual content on television have distorted attitudes about sexuality that it must be that everybodys whos not married is going around having sex all the time and having kinky sex in all kinds of strange situations
1592429 the rise of sexually transmitted diseases and the increase in out of wedlock pregnancies and births
1592430 im not sure i accept the premise that negative effects arent happening
1592431 it has been going down and the rate s of out of wedlock births and of teen births have been going down but until they go down to zero we have to keep trying to promote these positive values in our culture
1592432 the truth is children think about sex whether we want them to or not there are groups of people out there who are devoted to scaring the heck out of americans i think it makes some people feel good because they say aha theres the enemy and if only we could do something about that everything would be better

1592514 first time buyers were faced with severe affordability constraints when property prices reached their peak last year and have been sitting on their hands since the start of the credit crunch
1592515 the reduction in prices coupled with rising rents has now caused them to show a renewed interest in entering the market particularly in the east south east and south of london
1592516 the rental market is still strong and is helping to underpin the housing market as demand for rented accommodation remains high with rents increasing again in july

1592519 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1592520 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1592521 our principal concerns in this environment have been risk management strict cost control supporting our customers and continued investment to support our long term strategic ambitions
1592522 our broad based and resilient revenue streams continue to provide a stable platform from which to achieve strong long term performance
1592523 i am looking at a number of measures and i am not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1592524 it is helping people that is important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1592525 the government shouldnt be trying to bribe people into buying houses in a falling market
1592526 with the economy grinding to a halt we are already likely to see a shortfall in taxation suspending stamp duty even on a temporary basis will only make this situation worse
1592527 this is the first real sign from the government that it is looking to take practical steps to help spearhead an economic recovery
1592528 if the burden of stamp duty is removed it will create renewed confidence in the housing market helping to halt the current downwards spiral
1592529 unsurprisingly sale and rent back continues to be a controversial issue
1592530 far from being an alternative to the many equity release products aimed at older people sale and rent back offers flexible tenure for those can no longer afford the costs of home ownership
1592531 for some becoming tenants will be a temporary stop gap while they get their finances back in order for others they will reap the benefits including cost of living in rental accommodation
1592532 as we have said before peoples homes are not like other commodities
1592533 we must act in order to ensure those consumers facing financial difficulty and imminent repossession are protected from rogue landlords
1592534 in some parts of the country like in the south of england it wont have much impact
1592535 even at 120 000 that would be too low in the south so the threshold should certainly be reviewed and maybe even its structure changed to give more help
1592536 its a very difficult task when theyve banded these big numbers around before the uptake has never really been what theyve hoped for partly because people dont really know of or understand the schemes but partly also because of limitations
1592537 housebuilders are being hit extremely hard as housing market activity and house prices crumble in the face of elevated affordability pressures very tight lending conditions and low buyer interest
1592538 the purchasing managers survey suggests the contraction could be even deeper in the third quarter
1592539 there can therefore be little doubt that the construction sector is now firmly in recession

1592544 they all said he had throat cancer an easy conclusion because he was well known for drinking smoking and using tobacco in fact he died of a very rare cancer
1592545 i used to see him as a giant on the field now i see him as a giant off the field
1592546 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back
1592547 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1592548 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it
1592549 i knew id like it here but i didnt know id like it this much
1592550 the girls didnt get a second chance why should he
1592551 were in a mode here of trying to win ballgames but also of trying to find out some things about what guys can do and what roles they can be successful in

1592553 i was kind of surprised because hed started swinging the bat well

1592555 the intention seems to be to use microphones housed on a console with voice recognition software for actions like analysing your voice to match you with a games character or recalling your personal config settings at the sound of your voice
1592556 theres even a suggestion that noise making gizmos could be packaged in cereal boxes with the specific noise they make triggering an unlockable item in game
1592557 the first second and third control signals are proportional to the amount of pressure detected along the associated first second and third axes
1592558 i cant do the team much good unless i get healthy weve been trying to treat it for the last couple of days and it hasnt worked

1592560 this is the best thing for his peace of mind
1592561 while there has been a big drop in demand there are some big regional variations
1592562 london and the south east with the olympic project and infrastructure projects like cross rail and thames link can offset the demand for private housing in particular
1592563 in these uncertain times we are committed to helping borrowers who are looking for either their first mortgage or a new competitive deal
1592564 we are giving practical support by providing lower rates on all our fixed and tracker mortgages and at the same time we still have discounts on arrangement fees of 100
1592565 because landlords have secured tenancies for this academic year already they have not been required to show an epc certificate
1592566 they should not rest on their laurels though and think they can delay obtaining an epc assessment
1592567 students look to secure property for the following academic year early so they dont have to worry about finding accommodation when they have the stress of summer exams so landlords without an epc for their property could find themselves missing out
1592568 letting to students can be lucrative as landlords typically charge on a per room basis and the tenancy usually comes with a parental guarantee but landlords have to comply with an increasing number of regulations
1592569 there is such a risk we will be left with the mortgage customers no other lender wants
1592570 there is no question that those customers who represent the better credit risks find it easier to get good alternative products elsewhere
1592571 and those that are perhaps poorer risk find it more difficult but we do expect over time that is going to increase the risk of our book
1592572 the end of the housing market boom with house prices dropping ought to be good news for first time buyers who can finally be in a position to afford the home that was out of reach
1592573 however with the mortgage market contracting lenders are getting tougher on how much they will lend and what level of deposit theyll demand which means first time buyers are yet to see much benefit from the house price slide
1592574 i guess crime didnt exist in australia before the internet
1592575 the reports latest figures show a continued decline in permanent placements which has now spread to the traditionally robust temporary jobs market this is a clear indication that the credit crunch has started to reach the jobs market
1592576 business confidence is low and as a result employers are becoming much more cautious in their approach to recruiting following years of a candidate driven jobs market the balance has shifted it could be argued that employers now have the upper hand in an increasingly competitive jobs market
1592577 us gently but urgently to search our own lives for our own lessons that is teaching at its very best
1592578 surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken smitten by god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace and with his stripes we are healed
1592579 well i hear what youre saying but i only have a few small ideas of where to begin

1592592 a great logo doesnt mean anything until the brand makes it worth something
1592593 the value of the logo is directly relational to the companys ability to reproduce a logo with the goal of becoming uniquely recognizable
1592594 it isnt enough for a company to have a great logo if the communications effort isnt carried out across the full spectrum of the companys interaction with its marketplaces

1592660 this shows the role played by the french in the genocide itself
1592661 it also highlights the role played by france in the aftermath of the genocide to protect the genocidal forces and to make it very difficult for them to be apprehended and brought to justice

1592726 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
1592727 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

1592740 you must have roughage to make the bowels move freely concentrated food processed foods and constipation go hand in hand and then pills laxatives are used more constipation and more pills it is a vicious circle with bad results dont be afraid of cracked wheat cornmeal cut oats raw cabbage onions and celery they are far better than refined flour and the package foods that flood the market they may save some labor in the kitchen but they produce constipation
1592741 how many bowel movements do you have each day or each week

1592748 he will continue to pay state employees their full salaries
1592749 it was just depressing down here and now theres life
1592750 so far customers have been very positive with us being here and they want to know that were going to continue being here
1592751 its a prime piece of real estate theres no question about that
1592752 the question is in this economy whats going to work
1592753 gas prices will cause a lot of pain and high fuel cost is a reality we will see for a while
1592754 the important lesson in this is that usually the best answer to short term problems is a long term solution people need to look for any opportunity to cut fuel usage
1592755 it feels weird wiring orders to places that i would usually think are pretty close like elk grove
1592756 but we are having to do that more and more often
1592757 weve become wise and conscious of where we are going we dont need to go to the same area twice in a day
1592758 we need to be more efficient with our deliveries and we are working harder to do better
1592759 of course we are affected by gas we make deliveries and the jump in flour prices has hurt us
1592760 a lot of people we know in the pizza delivery business just have to raise their prices though
1592761 it used to cost me 20 to fill up my honda and now it costs me 45
1592762 i thought i was smart to not have a gas guzzler but its not good enough
1592763 we dont charge people for a plate when they come into a restaurant so we cant put this extra money on them
1592764 thousands i guess ive lost count just dont swat at them and youll be fine
1592765 see there is a lot of activity plenty of cells are filled with honey and some larvae
1592766 one year the vines didnt produce any berries and when i mentioned it to our neighbor he told me it was because he had lost his backyard beehives there were no bees to pollinate the berry vines
1592767 i just got interested in it so i ordered some hives and some bees out of the sears catalog and ive been beekeeping ever since
1592768 there havent been as many flowers and water sources this year
1592769 a colony can become overwhelmed by mites viral bacteria or fungal disease or pesticides the colony might find themselves in a location where they cant find pollen which is the health food for them chemicals in the environment can also change the behavior of the bees
1592770 in the spring the colonies that made it through the winter have an extremely good reproduction potential
1592771 they can build quickly from 10 000 to 45 000 bees then they split off into another colony and continue reproducing so you can hear about the decline of honeybees but they do rebound quickly when conditions are right
1592772 you also hear about ccd colony collapse disorder which is the sudden disappearance of the worker bees
1592773 only about 25 percent of the beekeepers feel they have had ccd and it doesnt seem to be a problem with wild bees or organic bees overall id say honeybees are doing ok
1592774 the more oversight and review into cps the safer the children will be in the future
1592775 heartening that the county now appears to be taking this seriously
1592776 but it is distressing in the extreme that it took so much news coverage so many angry editorials for the county board of supervisors to do what every parent would do at the first hint of trouble not when it becomes a full blown scandal
1592777 the idea is not to have it be one of these year long projects but to be more strategic and timely
1592778 i think its important for ourselves and for the community to know its not just us looking at ourselves which were doing but that theres outside expertise
1592779 why should i worry about somebody that probably doesnt know me
1592780 if hes an expert he supposed to know who i am its not like i came off the bench ive been starting for three years
1592781 he can move like a 295 pounder as far as running stunts and rushing the passer
1592782 hes got that type of athleticism and quickness but the good thing on top of that is hes big enough and strong enough where he can stuff the run too
1592783 kelly has the potential to be a pro bowl guy i think by warren being here for a few years i think that helped him out to learn that position
1592784 when youre not winning youre not going to know about me
1592785 i dont worry about that you cant worry about what other people say i worry about what my coaches and teammates say and i go from there
1592786 when he did play in there at times before he was dominant he was extremely hard for guards to reach more of a knock back player hes an old fashioned head up and knock the guy straight backwards guy
1592787 keith he has a high regard for me keith was a great defensive player and hes worked with me every day for the last two three years so if he thinks i can get that i know i can get that
1592788 we wanted to focus on mobile technology and felt that most of the market was dominated by wap related applications we felt that mobile tv will take off
1592789 we had seen a lot of people try to bring in 3g solutions and slap it into existing networks and fail what we tried to do is to build a customised solutions which would work in clients 2g network and eventually evolve into 3g
1592790 funds are primarily going to be used to expand the team on the marketing front and for setting up the infrastructure we will work with each operator to take the product to the next level
1592791 we have developed a propriety technology of our own which basically does a progressive play of radio
1592792 the main focus for us was to build a platform and have the whole solution ready integrated with every operator so when 3g comes in we can exploit the market
1592793 we are in 3g trials with some operators right and expect to roll out the product in the next 3 6 months
1592794 ik heb niet 1 maar 2 levende chickies die ik flow het zijn ook nog eens zusjes

1592796 the worst offender may be poor ryder robinson who has axl roses hair at age four can someone please call child services
1592797 coders who explore technology through innovation and research play a vital role in developing and securing the software and hardware we use everyday yet this important work can be stymied by bogus legal threats
1592798 effs coders rights project will provide a front line defense for coders facing legal challenges for legitimate research activities
1592799 those of us doing research on computer security and privacy need to be able to discuss and publish our work without fear of legal threats
1592800 the coders rights project will give critical legal help to programmers and developers who do the hard work in keeping technology robust and users safe
1592801 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1592802 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1592803 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1592804 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1592805 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1592806 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1592807 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1592808 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1592809 more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the
1592810 takes its rightful place on the world stage north korea traps its people in misery and isolation
1592811 we who seek the abolition of nuclear weapons are the majority
1592812 last year 170 countries voted in favor of japans u n resolution calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons only three countries the united states among them opposed this resolution
1592813 we need to pass that message on to our childrens generation
1592814 saya masuk golkar setelah wiranto dan prabowo keluar karena partai golkar tadinya identik dengan militer
1592815 saya ini kan penulis setelah masuk partai saya akan lebih terinspirasi feeling saya untuk menulis tidak akan hilang

1592817 memang ada beberapa partai seperti pmb pan dan pdip yang menawari saya tetapi saya melihat pan selalu berubah ubah tahun ini mereka banyak menjadikan artis menjadi caleg sedangkan untuk pdip di sana ideologinya soekarnoisme saya tidak bisa saya harus menjadi diri saya sendiri
1592818 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1592819 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1592820 its amazing how much more accessible all these tail sports are that you would never see on air
1592821 these are events that are not in most cases big enough to warrant being on one of the main channels
1592822 that i think is going to help redefine the way that people experience sports online and any live content online

1593061 doing things weve never done can often seem very difficult and complicated until the day we actually try them out
1593062 children learn by playing and become the masters of the game and they do it just by having fun
1593063 when something more effective and easy comes along we let go of the harder way very quickly without being taught
1593064 friends share with us what they think and feel teachers teach us what to do and how to do it coaches ask us who we want to be mentors show us who we can be masters show us who we really are
1593065 when we held back our feelings and said things only to please others often we ended up upsetting someone later
1593066 there is no such thing as an unbreakable promise for the future
1593067 miracles are not accidents we create them through our choices
1593068 there are always reasons for everything to exist in this world and so called problems and issues only exist for us to see something beyond so that we get to experience the next positive transformation
1593069 if we count all the things we love in our life we may find the way to bring in more simplicity and joy into it
1593070 maybe its actually all very simple no worries tomorrow is just another day
1593071 actions and words dont always accurately reflect who we are every single one of us has had the experience of wanting to undo what we did or said
1593072 every single thing we do is to satisfy the need for connection
1593073 we cannot feel unhappy when we are feeling totally connected its impossible
1593074 connection is the core of everything thats what life is connection
1593075 we are designed to constantly seek ways to connect to each other and to a greater purpose
1593076 we can only truly celebrate the victory with others when we win together then we feel connected
1593077 this is the game called one the aim of the game is to connect we keep connecting until we all become one
1593078 solutions coming from fear and doubt may not be the most effective ways we end up feeling more and more disconnected from each other
1593079 there are so many things we dont understand in life in spite of that lack of understanding though we often enjoy experiencing those things
1593080 its very very clear that we dont need to know all of the hows and whys of life to keep living on this planet
1593081 the scientists are not here to reveal the truth because we are here to seek it forever they are actually here to complicate the game of life so that we can have more questions and enjoy the game longer
1593082 seeing is important but trying to figure out everything isnt necessary
1593083 when we give more and communicate wholeheartedly we have less insecurity both emotionally and physically
1593084 giving love is the only way to be generously loved
1593085 the people who give more time money kindness love ideas have more of these things because thats the balance and balance is the natural law of life
1593086 one key in the giving process is never to expect a return when we give
1593087 we can feel the real joy of giving when were doing something for others knowing that were simply doing it for doing it for our own joy
1593088 giving something to others is so much easier than trying to get it first
1593089 every single one of us prospers when we learn to give value to others first we are rewarded naturally
1593090 were not here to give in order to get were here to have more to give more
1593091 because we cant have scarcity when we are totally grateful
1593092 what if giving actually was as important as brushing teeth
1593093 giving is not just about helping others it is about sharing the joy we do it for our own joy first and we pass it on
1593094 so without denying the benefit of having more innovation because it feels good can we find the way to have more joy in our life if we can then we can go beyond the temporal gratification we can create a sense of permanent certainty
1593095 charity organisations are like our out sourcing agencies for the giving of our life
1593096 businesses and charities are actually the same thing someone started the organisation with the passion to do something to make a difference
1593097 the moment we start giving out of guilt we appreciate charities far less
1593098 the moment we perceive someone as poor our perception creates the poor feeling in the other person
1593099 the moment we believe we have more were saying others have less and our attitude creates separation
1593100 big is nothing other than a whole lot of smalls small things can actually transform the world
1593101 trying to fight the trade in black market tickets by emailing the guilty sellers and demanding they stop the auctions in some cases where the row and seat number were listed they were able to pinpoint the exact member and threaten to cancel their tickets were doing everything in our power to try and curb this kind of activity but its not something we can prevent said a spokeswoman for the rsc
1593102 like every subsidised theatre we do have a priority booking scheme but we have a limit to ours if every one of our priority bookers most of them people who are simply conscientious theatregoers who paid 30 to join it bought a seat they could still only fill about 40 of the house i think it gets dangerous if we arent letting the general public to have access to a majority of our seats those priority bookers took about 37 of the seats for othello leaving about 63 that went on sale to the general public so most of the people watching othello were not a theatre elite or rich
1593103 given the profile of the actors who are involved in our production of hamlet we understand that there might be a temptation to record or photograph parts of the production this can be incredibly distracting to actors and other audience members and can cause significant disruption to the performance we ask that you do not take photographs whilst in the courtyard theatre should anyone breach these conditions they may be refused admission or asked to leave during the performance
1593104 due to the huge amount of interest in the rscs current production of hamlet only royal shakespeare company or production related memorabilia will be signed by members of the company it is very flattering that there is so much interest in this production but the sheer volume of requests means that we need to set some limits which will be as fair as possible for everyone
1593105 doing these big plays you frankly ought to be under pressure the sheer act of getting through five acts of shakespeare requires such muscularity another celebrity wouldnt get through it but davids doing an incredible job but no matter how much the audience enjoy it it will be defined by what the critics say its a hall of mirrors

1593142 as democracy is perfected the office of president represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
1593143 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag carrying a cross
1593144 those who give up liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both
1593145 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
1593146 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
1593147 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public
1593148 our petrol prices are based on a seven day average of the market price in singapore
1593149 however even when the price decreases in singapore the petrol at the port augusta petrol station or any other outlet for that matter would have been bought at a previous possibly much higher price
1593150 however we have seen prices gradually falling and we fully expect the price to lower as cheaper fuel flows into the marketplace
1593151 a lot of students just didnt come to school at all monday
1593152 ten students in a school like us isnt the same as 10 students in an adelaide school
1593153 grahams a liberal and going out of office so im pretty sure hed put up a good fight for us
1593154 its looking pretty good that we will get what we want
1593155 some people might not even know they have family members there
1593156 walking through the cemetery you wouldnt even know that there were graves there so it was very hard for families to find members
1593157 the aim of the project is to improve the appearance of the cemetery and ensure as many graves as possible are marked
1593158 because of the enormous cost of the upgrade council is unable to fund the cost of the plaques and is asking relatives to contribute by purchasing a plaque for deceased relatives
1593159 when the new health care act was being commissioned pika wiya was given the option by the minister to see if they wanted to be under the country health care plan or go under their own
1593160 the service is encouraged by the department to become community controlled
1593161 country health sa are happy to be working with pika wiya in giving them every assistance to become a community centre
1593162 the co location has been an ongoing process in spits and spats for five years
1593163 suddenly its back on the radar and no one has really told us teachers anything
1593164 we pretend that we are one school but we are two different bodies of teachers operating differently
1593165 if the school burnt down today we could do it co locate pretty well
1593166 but do you want to do it pretty well or do you want to do it brilliantly
1593167 the wellbeing of students and staff is paramount during any major works project and every effort is being made to minimise any disruption to their studies caused by the co location
1593168 we dont want to be stuck with a school thats half baked
1593169 and its hard to think of anything like iit anywhere in the world it is a very unique institution
1593170 well i havent really thought about it too much it was just on my mind
1593171 now im starting to embrace it and it makes life easier
1593172 i worry that weve been around so long were not the new kid on the block anymore
1593173 how many wineries had every single wine they made reviewed not many that goes to the core of our strength products that you can rely on you dont find a bad bottle we dont make bad wine some people will have favorites some wines will outscore others but even our columbia valley wines are great value wines
1593174 as you move up the slope from seven hills you get a thinner and thinner deposit of loess windblown soil until its just about 3 or 4 feet at the top right over fractured basalt at the top we hit places where we were actually ripping into the basalt
1593175 could you provide some guidance on the best way to send food back to the kitchen
1593176 how do you tell your server the food is bad whats the best way to get problems with your meal taken care of
1593177 wait er how about some water over here and yo whats with this salt lick disguised as a chicken breast
1593178 excuse me but my proscuitto wrapped chicken with tapenade is oversalted would you be kind enough to take it back to the kitchen and have the chef prepare me another
1593179 hey you with the apron when did they reel in this daily catch during the reagan administration and whats with the embryonic veggies
1593180 pardon me but my 32 troll caught salmon tastes a bit off and those baby vegetables are just adorable but theyre also undercooked
1593181 ive always been appreciative when people let me know theres a problem
1593182 they should let us know theres a problem right away so we can have the opportunity to fix it right away
1593183 sometimes people dont want to create a problem at the table
1593184 theyll say i didnt want to tell you this at the restaurant but and then they complain about the food
1593185 flag the server down tell them its a little too much this a little too little that
1593186 any restaurant should want to send everyone out the door happy
1593187 the first priority even if were up to our elbows in alligators
1593188 it goes right to the head of the ticket queue
1593189 its the managers duty to run the fix out and make sure the guest is happy with it
1593190 we often have people send food back because they dont like it and thats sort of irritating theyll order stuff without carefully reading the menu and dont realize theres garlic or pine nuts or a certain herb they dont like
1593191 i generally dont have a problem remaking a dish if its not cooked properly you should send it back
1593192 but well take it back anyway and say would you like something else
1593193 leggiamo relazioni su torture persecuzioni e violenze contro le donne che cosa dice questo consiglio che cosa ha deciso niente
1593194 which is really too bad because our kids are the greatest kids in the universe
1593195 down syndrome children were institutionalized and left to die their life expectancy was 20 years and even if the child was not institutionalized expectations for them were very low
1593196 im afraid im going to need some financial help with gas money to continue to see mom and dad often ive calculated what it costs me to get there and back and ive split it into equal parts i hope youre willing to help me out here
1593197 i decided to follow these fortune cookies back to their source from the winners back to the restaurants back to the factory and the people who write the fortunes back to the very historic origins of fortune cookies

1593199 what was the first seed from which your book grew
1593200 this book was the idea of my lovely agent lucy luck
1593201 water rupert how about that you could write a book about water
1593202 literary agent julian alexander for thinking up the idea in the first place
1593203 it was nick hern who urged me write a book about orson welless theatre and kathleen tynan and leo lerman who persuaded me to go the whole hog and take on
1593204 i would like to thank my publishers for the initiation of this project
1593205 if he would be interested in writing a short book about harold pinter
1593206 not a book which i would have been reckless enough to propose writing
1593207 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington
1593208 they are making fun of a step that every expert says will absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1593209 a crime sir what happened is anyone hurt do you need an ambulance
1593210 no im okay but my sandwich isnt it doesnt have any sauce

1593213 um sir this number is for actual emergencies you know life and death situations unless someone at that shop has a knife or gun to your head this is not an emergency
1593214 you dont understand i wanted sauce and they refused to give it to me i want someone to make them do it right
1593215 dit onderstreept nog eens dat er internationaal grote interesse is in de aanlanding van lng in nederland
1593216 het aantal kilos verdovende middelen dat in beslag wordt genomen vertoont een dalende trend
1593217 deze trend hangt vermoedelijk mede samen met de afschrikwekkende werking van het nieuwe walradarsysteem en de zichtbare aanwezigheid van de kustwacht op het water
1593218 met het nieuwe walradarsysteem beschikt de kustwacht over een omgevingsbeeld van de wateren rond de benedenwinden dat een adequate en gerichte informatie gestuurde inzet mogelijk maakt ook beschikt de kustwacht inmiddels over een eigen luchtverkenningscapaciteit met de komst van twee nieuwe dash 8 vliegtuigen
1593219 hiermee heeft al het personeel een passende functie toegewezen gekregen in de nieuwe formatie na overleg met de vakbonden en de personeelsdiensten van de landen daarnaast is het personeelsbestand van de kustwacht uitgebreid van 198 naar 236 medewerkers deze uitbreiding is vooral gelegen in het onderbrengen van het steunpunt hato het voormalig militair vliegveld hato bij de kustwacht ten behoeve van de luchtverkenningscapaciteit
1593220 als alles naar wens verloopt is de aanzet van de nieuwe scheldebrug op 12 augustus zichtbaar
1593221 het blijft wel afwachten hoe het de komende dagen zal evolueren
1593222 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1593223 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1593224 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1593225 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1593226 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1593227 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1593228 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1593229 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1593230 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1593231 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1593232 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1593233 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1593234 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1593235 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1593236 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1593237 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1593238 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1593239 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1593240 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1593241 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1593242 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1593243 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1593244 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1593245 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1593246 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1593247 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1593248 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1593249 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1593250 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1593251 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1593252 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1593253 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1593254 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1593255 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1593256 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1593257 i feel like i need to be turning that water into wine
1593258 were telling our employees that using videoconferencing is beneficial not just for the environment but also for life balance
1593259 top management who fly a lot recognize that spending your life in airports can be really horrible
1593260 videoconferencing has become an integral part of corporations communication strategy over the last 18 to 24 months
1593261 the pace was unbelievable i mean ive been watching mls for probably 10 years and i think that was one of the best games ive ever seen being in the back i can say that i watched it because i wasnt in the thick of it the pace was good and houston is a great team and they kept coming at us
1593262 you try to play it cool but i knew the weight of it
1593263 im the new guy on the revolution so i wanted to make sure i hit the back of the net
1593264 igwe would tell you that he didnt hear us calling him off and he thought he had to clear the ball that stuff is going to happen hes a young guy who bounced back from that and played great

1593266 new foreclosures more than tripled in los angeles in july from a year ago with more than 2 billion of mortgages turning sour in los angeles alone propertyshark said the number of newly scheduled auctions of foreclosed properties in los angeles county rose 249 percent to 5 982 from july 2007 los angeles saw foreclosure activity start to spread to wealthier areas such as malibu santa monica and manhattan beach according to the report
1593267 we are still in the middle of a housing hurricane where foreclosure activity remains high home prices have declined and the number of sales transactions has fallen dramatically said ceo bill staniford
1593268 as much as one quarter of the single family homes in foreclosure in california have renters occupying them according to an estimate from the california apartment association gov arnold schwarzenegger signed a bill into law in july to extend the amount of time such tenants are given before they must vacate the house from 30 days to 60 days
1593269 homeowners who live in their house are only entitled to three days once the bank has repossessed the house before theyre evicted tenants get at least 60 days to stay there and they dont have to pay rent
1593270 even though its bad its really not as bad as it sounds said local attorney steven kellman who runs the tenants legal center
1593271 kellman has seen a spike in calls from tenants whose landlords are in foreclosure he said kellman attributed that trend to significant appreciation in the housing market this decade where homeowners bought second or third or fifth properties with hopes of renting them out
1593272 we had new landlords novice landlords coming in and going out they get to hold their property for two three years he said
1593273 the riverside san bernardino metropolitan area ranked second in the country in the percentage of properties with foreclosure filings realtytrac said there were 43 600 foreclosures in the inland empire in the second quarter
1593274 fontana has been hit very hard by the difficulties in the real estate market but roberto tavarez district manager of r amp r home lending in fontana said he believes the biggest hit has already been taken
1593275 tavarez said that after the tremendous plunge in home prices during the past two years buyers are now ready to check out the market again
1593276 some houses that were once in the 400 000 range are down in the 200 000s he said
1593277 there have been more than 1 000 home foreclosures in the last three months in tulare county leaving once full neighborhoods blotted with abandoned houses tracking down the former occupants isnt always helpful many during the mortgage crisis have simply walked away from their homes say real estate and community development officials
1593278 most houses in foreclosure come up with the banks as owners many are out of state banks and some are outside the country said tim burns neighborhood preservation manager for the city of visalia it can seem like nobody is willing to accept responsibility for a property within this foreclosure process burns said
1593279 dave and pat griepsma watched helplessly as weeds on their neighbors visalia property climbed to the homes back windows and took over the front yard
1593280 the home in the 3900 block of east oak avenue has been vacant for two years the for sale sign was long gone and the owner they knew his first name only was nowhere to be found
1593281 we didnt know who to call pat griepsma said recently
1593282 there were 515 completed transactions made through the mls in manteca as of july 29 within the city limits that number translates into an annual sales pace of 895 homes but if you look at the past two months when sales accelerated sharply the market actually is on pace to reach the 1 050 mark
1593283 that is more homes than what had been sold through the mls for the previous two years when 402 homes were sold in manteca in 2007 and 627 homes in 2006
1593284 the median sales price of those 515 homes is 260 205 or the same it was in mid 2002 prices of existing resale homes peaked in manteca when they registered a median price of 429 000
1593285 but that doesnt reflect the quirkiness of some foreclosure sales homes that need a lot of work back in 2002 with a strong market the homes considered less desirable still held value in a reasonable relationship with the middle of the market
1593286 now with the sub 250 000 market driving manteca and more forecloses becoming available each day banks are pricing those less desirable homes extremely aggressive to make sure they dont linger it has effectively driven prices of such homes back into the late 1990s levels
1593287 eight out of every 10 homes in manteca are selling under duress there are 457 existing homes currently available for sale in manteca that number includes 178 bank owned homes 170 short sales and 109 homes not under duress
1593288 alameda county assessor ron thomsen has delivered the 2008 2009 gross local assessment roll of 207 2 billion reflecting a 9 6 billion increase 4 87 percent above last years assessment roll
1593289 the 2008 09 assessment roll accurately reflects assessments of more than 490 000 taxable properties including the 44 212 properties that were provided reduced assessments due to recent market value declines thomsen said

1593291 its like they just threw these places together said laureen emmons who has lived in clover springs with her husband bob since 2000

1593295 willo cq rose a real estate agent who lives in clover springs said her house has problems with mold and one of the windows is cracking if i were to sell the house id have to replace the linoleum she said
1593296 lanette zootis a real estate agent in windsor said the soft housing market has been tough on her family and caused her to do everything she can to squirrel away money for a rainy day ironically that means more shopping not less as she hunts harder for the best deals
1593297 its not so much that we have financial problems but the job stability is just not there she said
1593298 zootis was back to school shopping with her daughters at the meryvns department store in santa rosa last week when her 8 year old karley rejected some clothes as so totally not my style
1593299 the state department of real estate wrapped up its arguments monday in the mortgage fraud proceedings against david crisp and carl cole but not before fleshing out some details in the case
1593300 joe carrillo a senior deputy commissioner with the department of real estate testified he wore a wire for the fbi while interviewing cole at a real estate office in may 2007
1593301 former crisp cole amp associates employee janie jj stockton received at least 20 000 from crisp in exchange for using her name as the purchaser on loan documents carrillo said
1593302 she signed everything that david crisp gave her to sign carrillo testified
1593303 during cross examination carrillo said gary crabtree brought discrepancies in the values of properties to the departments attention crabtree an appraiser said monday afternoon in a phone interview that he wrote a letter about transactional anomalies to the bakersfield association of realtors executive committee
1593304 former tower lending employee jayson costa testified that both cole and crisp knew he wasnt a licensed broker he was encouraged to get his license but during the boom there was such a backlog at the state to get people licenses he said
1593305 costa now lives in lompoc and works at a dodge dealership
1593306 luke martin of the department of real estate testified that when he interviewed crisp in 2005 the real estate salesman brought magazine articles that detailed his success the private jet the designer clothes the fancy cars
1593307 during a hearing recess costa said he missed the real estate business i know carl and david are getting in trouble a lot of other people benefited from this boom we just made more money than everybody else costa said
1593308 something you can expect to read about more here and elsewhere is the opportunity exporting provides businesses of all sizes in helping to push us out of recession
1593309 larry sharp president and chief operating officer of arrowhead credit union and lori van arsdale a city council member in hemet dropped by the newspaper monday morning to talk about a major conference thats taking place in palm springs in october to encourage small and medium size businesses in particular to take advantage of export opportunities
1593310 new foreclosures more than tripled in los angeles in july from a year ago with more than 2 billion of mortgages turning sour in los angeles alone
1593311 kellman has seen a spike in calls from tenants whose landlords are in foreclosure he said kellman attributed that trend to significant appreciation in the housing market this decade where homeowners bought second or third or fifth properties with hopes of renting them out
1593312 we had new landlords novice landlords coming in and going out they get to hold their property for two three years he said
1593313 i could sell it today but i have to wait until the lease is up
1593314 a backyard pool was one of the many reasons matt reeves and his family thought a peoria home was ideal
1593315 carreon and his family moved in soon after that meeting
1593316 its like they just threw these places together said laureen emmons who has lived in clover springs with her husband bob since 2000
1593317 long term we have to get out of our dependence on housing to drive our economy sharp said
1593318 well as long as the drapes match the curtains its all good right
1593319 zootis was back to school shopping with her daughters at the meryvns department store in santa rosa last week when her 8 year old karley rejected some clothes as so totally not my style
1593320 ooyaah at 8 i wore jcpenney jeans levis didnt even exist black high top keds and a white t shirt standard 24 hr gear and a black crown top lunch box that was livin

1593330 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
1593331 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
1593332 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1593333 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1593334 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1593335 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1593336 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1593337 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1593338 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1593339 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1593340 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1593341 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1593342 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1593343 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1593344 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1593345 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1593346 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1593347 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1593348 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1593349 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1593350 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1593351 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1593352 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1593353 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1593354 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1593355 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1593356 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1593357 i just need to maintain what ive been doing all along
1593358 this cannot be the time that i give away all i have achieved at this club what matters is not what i have done in the past but what i still want to achieve
1593359 that always keep me on my toes that is why after i play a game it immediately becomes something of the past even if i did well my hunger just grows
1593360 since i arrived at sundowns the club has been recruiting exceptionally talented players at the start of every season
1593361 this motivates me to keep working hard at my game players like jabulani mendu and tebogo mokoena came in i respected them competed with them and benefited from their talent
1593362 ive always had respect for the competition in the team but this season it will be very interesting
1593363 however its not for me to say things about other players in the team because i respect every player who joins the club
1593364 i must just continue to give my best at training regardless of who im competing with whether he has been promoted from the development side or has come from europe
1593365 to be honest when i first arrived i never thought i would be here after four years
1593366 i always aim higher giving myself two year targets and with regards to an overseas move i havent achieved that target
1593367 i was hoping to have moved abroad by now but im not discouraged because i have knocked on that door before
1593368 just like many other players i dont want to end my career here and the president motsepe knows it
1593369 but life goes on and i will continue to give my best because i havent given up on my dream of playing abroad
1593370 performance matters more than age in football as long as i continue doing the job the right way doors will always open for me
1593371 the reason the squad was made bigger is because we will be facing difficulties this season
1593372 we will require a big squad to deal with injuries suspensions and a possible loss of form as we play league and cup matches and in the caf competition too
1593373 i do not know how much money we have spent
1593374 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1593375 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1593376 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1593377 i skate around in skates and tights its not that big a deal
1593378 from the 40 000 i donated we raised over a million
1593379 i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1593380 despite the complexities of the fighting thats going on between the rebels and the government there are 2 1 2 million men women and children who have been driven from their homes by a government that doesnt want them there the un needs to get peacekeepers into the area there should be 26 000 troops in there
1593381 athletes should have the right to say there are things in this world that are not right and we need to address them
1593382 one of them is darfur and china is the host country and its keeping those people from fulfilling their dreams theres potential olympians there
1593383 im not stunned that a non democratic government that doesnt endorse individual rights would be heavy handed
1593384 now we look at china it seems like theyre clamping down more and more and more in every single regard
1593385 everyones so desperate to do business in china that nobodys calling them on it
1593386 china has great economic ties with sudan so they back the sudanese
1593387 they dont really care what happens it seems like to the people in darfur
1593388 peace in darfur would be a much more huge accomplishment infinitely more satisfying
1593389 as soon as i put my skates on i thought this is what i want to do
1593390 when i was 15 i watched the 1994 lillehammer olympics and saw norways speedskater johann koss win three gold medals
1593391 youd have the worst insomnia because youd be worrying about am i going to be able to skate the same times i skated yesterday
1593392 i skated the best 1 000 meters ive ever skated and got the bronze
1593393 it is of course fantastic and a big relief but the biggest realization i had was basically that i had just pushed myself to manic depression and had been miserable and then when i did it i looked around and thought this is it the sun rises the same way and i still had to train seven hours a day
1593394 i realized you have a real shot to do something and not just win a medal and feel good about yourself
1593395 i decided next time not to do just a puppies and ice cream interview
1593396 so much of the news in the us is absolute garbage
1593397 its easy to say im not going to watch anything serious ill watch this garbage on britney spears
1593398 i dont blame the media as much as i blame ourselves if thats all you know it erodes a lot of what makes this country as great as it is
1593399 do i think its wrong that britney spears got 10 million more minutes of air time than 300 000 people in africa getting slaughtered yeah i think its bad but i try to focus on what i can do
1593400 as an american citizen if things get rough i can always pack up and go somewhere else
1593401 what infuriates me though is when you see people willfully supporting the dictator that enables this or giving the arms to one group of poor people so they can slaughter another slightly poorer group of poor people that infuriates me
1593402 olympic committees in the united kingdom belgium or new zealand countries that enjoy the same freedoms that we do tell you its not our place to be talking about this thats someone elses issue and no one else is solving it that infuriates me
1593403 it is great that mr cheeks voice is raising awareness especially at this time
1593404 the situation in darfur has cried out for international attention for years the suffering continues and still requires human intervention and protection for millions of civilians who are displaced
1593405 it is our hope that more athletes use the platform to shine the spotlight on human rights china needs to be pressed on their involvement in sudan
1593406 but not a lot of people are attacking the idea that these 2 million people need protection they may want me to go away but you cant assail the fact that these people need our help
1593407 the company will launch iphone 3g in 20 additional countries on august 22nd bringing the total to over 40 the remaining 30 will be ready before the end of the calendar year
1593408 porque viendo los resultados creo firmemente de que si hay un dios tendr a que ser hombre
1593409 por si no lo notaste el tono de este post es totalmente ir nico etc etc
1593410 a china se concentrou em fortalecer a seguran a e a prote o em volta dos locais de competi o ol mpica e da vila ol mpica
1593411 declarar responsabilidade administrativa dos funcion rios p blicos envolvidos em il citos administrativos
1593412 t m que admitir que agora na venezuela as coisas mudaram e os delitos contra as coisas p blicas s o sancionados
1593413 por anos o governo chin s tem tentado utilizar a olimp ada para legitimar a ocupa o ilegal do tibete
1593414 jornalistas s o proibidos na rea controlada pela pol cia de fronteira mas os dois desobedeceram a ordem
1593415 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
1593416 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world
1593417 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1593418 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1593419 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1593420 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1593421 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1593422 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1593423 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1593424 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1593425 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1593426 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1593427 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1593428 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1593429 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1593430 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1593431 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1593432 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1593433 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1593434 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1593435 who are open to doing something on the production side
1593436 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1593437 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1593438 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1593439 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1593440 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1593441 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1593442 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

1593446 could it be possible that such measures would last longer or even be permanent
1593447 not only do foreign athletes need fresher air we need that too
1593448 most of these measures are long term ones and will remain after the games not all the temporary measures will be retained after the games but they may provide clues for our future work
1593449 beijing has made a lot of effort but these are temporary measures

1593452 its actually not like the great adventure its not so much a quest movie its more of a war movie well okay its absolutely a war movie cultures grinding up to a horrible moment where it just all spills over and gets out of control less of an adventure party quest type situation more of an armies building to an inevitable conclusion type situation
1593453 while my heart lies with the horde and thralls an interesting character from a movie making standpoint a blockbuster movie its a little rough to try and tell it from the perspective of this green looking dude
1593454 we are starting those conversations were going to be looking for someone of zak snyder 300 or chris nolan the dark knight batman beings calibre
1593455 i can tell you that this is the one thing about running a studio and making these things thats hard you want to not compromise and have the right level of intensity the story and the directors vision is whats ultimately going to dictate that personally one of my favorite movies of all time is lord of the rings which has a pg 13 rating
1593456 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority

1593463 mike and i agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be
1593464 like you i find these camps intolerable but i find equally intolerable the use made of them every day in the bourgeois press
1593465 its one of the reasons we tend to hold asset managers
1593466 there is a limited number of them and they are attractive takeover targets there wont be many independents left
1593467 it gave us appeal in the minds of potential acquisitors
1593468 they kept their own identity they kept their own investment style and also portfolio management team
1593469 mackenzie has great credibility as far as we are concerned
1593470 the process covered half a dozen or so potential buyers
1593471 we have 50 million of annualized revenues and we have 30 million in cash so there was not a problem with the company back then or even today
1593472 mackenzie has got roots there whereas saxon was trying to grow roots in that area
1593473 their funds have not been doing well because of their value style
1593474 one of the things that abitibis working on is refinancing
1593475 we have experience with that weve gone through it ourselves and weve helped others through it as well so where we can assist we will but were not looking to be activists
1593476 getting calls from everywhere from people who make widgets for conveyer belts in the u s midwest to canadian companies that are name brands
1593477 the banks arent lending and generally the private equity folks arent there theres not many players in the space right now to go and help these folks
1593478 if we think we can get 1 for 50 cents if theres intrinsic value then were going to go for it its never going to be going in to try and change the way things are being done in the company
1593479 it think its largely a commodity price story especially as weve seen oil prices start to look like they are on a downward trend
1593480 i think youre seeing some of that strength reverse as a result youre seeing some weakening in commodity based currencies including the canada
1593481 generally were in an environment where the u s dollar seems to be on a bit of an upswing and thats adding further fuel to this depreciating trend for the canada
1593482 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that weve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1593483 thats shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canadas growth prospects and thats a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1593484 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive
1593485 unfortunately theyre also dealing with a u s economy thats looking very much to be in recession
1593486 if it stays down it probably will relieve some of the pressure on manufacturers and exporters
1593487 the big question mark is is this a bet that the u s economy is going to rally in which case that is extremely good news for canadian manufacturers

1593489 the material that was in the container has been tested and its of no danger to anyone
1593490 the preliminary testing thus far is showing that it is not a substance of concern
1593491 it was supposed to contain screws which it did but it also contained a note and an unknown substance
1593492 it was a very simple note and from what i heard it wasnt even that rational
1593493 the probability of it being a hoax or not we dont even go there we just assume in every case that the threats serious
1593494 i think you have to ask yourself the intent and where did it come from
1593495 thats all part of the investigation of trying to determine that i dont have those answers for you today but thats where the investigation is going

1593521 we had a chance to use him in a less pressure situation but he wasnt effective
1593522 this is the best thing for his peace of mind
1593523 i kind of refused and they gave us one more year at fort tilden which was last year
1593524 in our talks with them we were convinced they were going to go ahead and hold the concerts
1593525 it would be a hike especially if you are handicapped
1593526 we really did feel it was a much better benefit to have it at riis park
1593527 the pieces of artificial jewelry are there but the gold and the diamond jewelry is gone
1593528 my gold my citizenship documents my degrees are gone my new crockery is gone
1593529 try and find out who did it and see that they get punished for it
1593530 they said they were going to be a family restaurant
1593531 the noise the disruptions throwing bottles all around parking in peoples driveways its terrible
1593532 it was like going to an evening social every night
1593533 there are so many things i learned during my years at the parks department
1593534 i learned how to climb trees because i was taking the climbers and pruners test i look up and see hawks soaring and i know they arent pigeons i can identify some trees and plants i would have never known this if i had stayed at the phone company
1593535 insofar as the postponement of the armm elections we can no longer postpone because the senate is not moving
1593536 we hope we can ask the plenary to come to a vote but we are not of course sure whether we would be able to pass this on second reading
1593537 but we will do our best based on best efforts principle because we know we understand the present situation that even if we pass this on third reading nothing will happen to this bill because nothing is moving in the senate
1593538 we need to express or manifest our goodwill to our muslim colleagues to our muslim brothers we want to prove our sincerity even if what they ask or they are asking from us may not be able to get the desire results
1593539 but just the same we want to express very clearly that we share their desire for an attempt to achieve a final peace settlement in mindanao
1593540 we had to learn on our own how to become ourselves without losing each other
1593541 the olympics are a great forum for me to use to get my message out
1593542 im saying not to kill innocent animals theres nothing negative that goes into that
1593543 i go to the office in a swim suit im comfortable with shedding a few more items of clothing i dont think its too crazy or risqu
1593544 you have concerns im not out here taking my clothes off were doing it in a very positive way
1593545 im not trying to be in everybodys face and be harsh or negative i want to be calm and yet get my voice out there im doing it for all those animals who dont have a voice
1593546 i think some people were scared of what this might become
1593547 i think they tried censorship but it was not successful amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced
1593548 im hopeful things will change here but im not optimistic this is a message for the world
1593549 but things are changing five years ago you would never have considered doing things like this
1593550 there is always negative everyone has the right to their opinion not everyone is going to say shes a great woman shes doing a great thing that has never stopped me im a strong willed woman

1593553 extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances cannot be ignored because of conclusions made by the different investigative agencies saying that the military had certain levels of responsibility
1593554 its not a done deal as far as we are concerned but indeed we have a meeting of the minds
1593555 our official position is that the agreement on ancestral domain has been signed so its a done deal
1593556 not until then can anything be implemented sa katunayan kahit mapirmahan iyong comprehensive compact agreement ay kinakailangan ang mag usap in fact even if the comprehensive compact agreement is signed there is still a need to talk
1593557 hindi nangangahulugan na kung sakali nagkapirmahan ng moa on ancestral domain ay iyan na ang kasunduan it doesnt mean that if the moa on ancestral domain is signed that is the agreement
1593558 the moa on ancestral domain was just one of three major agenda items with each agenda hoping to strengthen the final agreement there is still a need to send it to congress for a new law that will effectively implement it
1593559 competing at an olympic games is something that has motivated me since the age of 10 and 11
1593560 on friday at the opening ceremony i will experience something astonishing i never thought i would be chosen to carry the flag but maybe its happened because a lot of athletes identify with me
1593561 i loved my sport from the moment i played my first game and i still enjoy training
1593562 ive only been here 12 days but dirk has waited 12 years for this to happen
1593563 i cant even imagine the emotions that he must be feeling at this moment
1593564 we have really huge expectations because four years ago we came with a big mission and we took a few medals back home
1593565 the conditions are really tough with the pollution and its really hot we dont have too many days to adapt so i hope to be much better than today
1593566 its a great honor its the first time ive seen an olympic ceremony so i will be very proud
1593567 this is a serious grave and tragic event there are a number of undisciplined military commanders and ethnic cleansing could happen
1593568 we have an milf force of about 11 000 mostly headed by undisciplined commanders now fast track it five years when you have now a state belonging to the milf in whatever form it is the military force of the milf will now have legal status five years from now we will have an milf security force that is probably well armed
1593569 ang temperament dun mainit nasasaktan ang mga tao the temperament there right now is volatile the people are hurt they are enraged by the way they handled the problem in mindanao
1593570 but there was never an order giving offensive against the milf
1593571 the initials only served to check the accuracy of the document it is no way considered a final signature
1593572 yang peace agreement na yan that peace agreement has nothing to do with solving the problems in mindanao it would never give lasting peace to mindanao the problem of peace in mindanao lagnat lang yan that is only fever
1593573 its not about territory its not about land areas its about addressing the real problem that is poverty
1593574 blame the government because they dont understand how precious the peace process is for the moros to the government its simply politics but for the moros who have for centuries had the determination they know the stakes are very high

1593577 expectations of higher u s interest rates diminished slightly after the fed meeting but the dollar is likely to stay on a steady footing as equities have gained
1593578 it will be hard to dislodge the dollar from these levels
1593579 but note that the dollars strength is not owed to the u s economys robustness but rather due to the fact that other major economies are faring worse solid u s macro fundamentals will be necessary for the dollar to retain long term support

1593589 the spot dollar rupiah is still heavy and todays government bond auction will drag further rupiah inflows
1593590 with oil prices falling the global economic picture is now changing were seeing a better investment climate
1593591 the big rally in the united states and other overseas markets
1593592 the main catalyst has been the oil price it has dropped quite a bit in the last two weeks
1593593 the market is always forward looking while inflation may have passed the consensus forecast in july if oil goes down then the inflationary pressures will ease that is why the market is going up
1593594 the mood is better after oil prices declined but credit seems to be lagging equities a little bit
1593595 investors are still looking at oil and seeing if it goes up again
1593596 commodity prices are still higher than a year ago and did costs go up for these guys no not really they are still making money

1593599 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1593600 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1593601 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people

1593619 when they told me i was speechless this new organization has done some wonderful things for this team and to induct me into this ring of honor is unbelievable

1593621 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1593622 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1593623 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1593624 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1593625 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1593626 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1593627 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1593628 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1593629 more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the
1593630 takes its rightful place on the world stage north korea traps its people in misery and isolation
1593631 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future

1593641 the trouble is that farmers generally dont know what they spend on grain drying
1593642 often the grainstore and house will all come off the same meter and they havent traditionally taken a lot of notice of diesel use
1593643 but the rise in energy costs means were looking at a doubling of drying costs compared with two years ago so its gone from an average of 50p t to take out each 1 moisture two years ago to 1 t now
1593644 that means the cost of taking out 3 moisture from a 1000t of grain has risen from 1500 to 3000 people forget that while 60 70 of a farms energy use comes from field work like cultivating drilling and harvesting the other 30 40 comes from grain storage and drying
1593645 its now got to a critical stage where people are saying there must be something they can do about it but theres no magic wand you can wave it can often be difficult to do anything yet you can find that one farmers drying costs can be twice those of his neighbours
1593646 we find that once the dew starts to fall theres a tendency to think you have to pack in however if you slow down but carry on after an hour or so the dew seems to soak into the stems and you can speed up again

1593653 wir haben uns f r ihn entschieden weil er wie kaum ein anderer die olympische idee verk rpert seit jahren ist es f r

1593656 es wird ganz schwer sich den gro en traum von gold zu erf llen
1593657 wir sind weiterhin der ansicht dass die atp dem hamburger turnier den masters status zu unrecht entzogen hat
1593658 das turnier am rothenbaum war immer eines der h chsten kategorie und der masters status ist uns zeitlich unbegrenzt zuerkannt worden solange wir die regularien der atp erf llen m sste dieser statuts jedes jahr erneuert werden
1593659 es h tte f r uns bei der auslosung sicherlich besser laufen k nnen
1593660 atletico madrid ist eine gute mannschaft die in der sehr starken spanischen liga im letzten jahr vierter geworden ist und ber starke spieler verf gt wir m ssen den gegner nun genau beobachten und versuchen uns im heimspiel eine gute ausgangsposition zu verschaffen
1593661 schalke ist sicherlich nicht der beste aber auch nicht der schlechteste gegner f r uns trotzdem gehen wir optimistisch in die spiele tatsache ist dass das r ckspiel in madrid ist und das ist ein vorteil f r uns
1593662 das ist ein hammer los der schwerstm gliche gegner f r uns das ist eine paarung die man sicher eher f rs achtel oder viertelfinale erwartet aber wir wollen um jeden preis in die gruppenphase und m ssen deshalb auch diesen gegner schlagen
1593663 in der qualifikation zur champions league gibt es keine leichten spiele aber wir haben in der letzten saison bewiesen was wir in der k nigsklasse leisten k nnen f r uns ist die partie gegen madrid ein super spiel und auch sicherlich f r unsere fans schon zu beginn der saison ein h hepunkt

1593669 in einem schwierigen wirtschaftlichen umfeld das weiterhin durch stark steigende rohstoffpreise und einen schwachen us dollar gekennzeichnet war erreichten wir ein sehr erfreuliches organisches umsatzwachstum
1593670 das organische wachstum wurde von allen unternehmensbereichen getragen es stammt insbesondere aus unseren wachstumsregionen w hrend die entwicklung in westeuropa verhalten war das bereinigte betriebliche ergebnis konnten wir weiter steigern die integration der national starch gesch fte die uns einen deutlichen umsatzschub brachten und die umsetzung des effizienzsteigerungsprogramms zur nachhaltigen verbesserung unserer wettbewerbsf higkeit verliefen planm ig trotz der schwierigen rahmenbedingungen sehen wir der entwicklung im weiteren jahresverlauf zuversichtlich entgegen

1593686 when i first got to the board relations between the county and the city were at an all time low
1593687 we have begun discussions on water conservation issues in the same way we began talks on the rta
1593688 the only thing we have is the bully pulpit and our congressional delegation
1593689 i still believe that common sense dictates that there was a security risk

1593693 we scratched and we clawed and we pulled some runs together ive been talking about that all year long the will to fight
1593694 it feels like youre hitting on sound at that point in time
1593695 hes one of those guys that obviously throws a very plus plus fastball in that situation all i was really trying to do was put the barrel on the ball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you hit it solidly which is going to go a long way
1593696 i can count probably four other times that its been like this
1593697 going back to seattle five hundred homers 600 things like that and now here and cincinnati the first time
1593698 when you need two outs to win the game its a tough loss
1593699 what can you do were all professionals here turn the page
1593700 everything was right i dont know what happened at the last moment
1593701 am i being told something is it time to go to pack it up
1593702 theres always been some doubt with all the things ive been through all the health issues
1593703 i just kept pushing to get to this point im at today one thing ive learned through this whole process is dont take anything for granted cherish every single one of them
1593704 he had the super duper sinker going he was just outstanding hopefully hes not too sore tomorrow its been a long time since hes done this the bulldog was on the attack getting ahead of hitters its big for the team to get mike a win
1593705 he was getting up there as far as his pitch count and he started elevating a little bit and thats a dangerous club over there they swing the bats
1593706 im pretty excited to get one it feels great ill have a chance to reflect on it the next few days
1593707 i went to pull the leaves out of her fur and her tail came off
1593708 she jumped up and i saw all the blood in her dog bed
1593709 the vet said she had 50 lacerations multiple puncture wounds from teeth
1593710 one day i was pulling weeds close to the fence when i noticed they have food out and they had a raccoon eating cat food from a dish there
1593711 theyre not little raccoons theyre huge and theyre very territorial they come home to roost and sit in the backyard like they own the place
1593712 they need to realize these animals are nothing to toy with
1593713 i threw it for a strike and he was able to put enough on it and find a spot out there
1593714 im sure every closer would rather go out in the ninth but were down here in august and were in the middle of a race and its whatever it takes
1593715 were not scrapping for first place but i think playing those type of games its intense
1593716 he wont come up with first base not occupied if he ever did that wed just walk him theres your answer
1593717 hes hotter than a match it seems like if we make a good pitch on him he hits it hard we make a bad pitch he hits it hard
1593718 its that time of the year the road is going to be hard we know that we want to win games on the road
1593719 sieht nicht unbedingt toll aus aber f r olympia macht man doch einiges
1593720 authentischen begeisterung f r die olympischen spiele seiner vorbildfunktion f r die jugend

1593722 am abend bleiben wir immer ein bisschen l nger sitzen und quatschen
1593723 die zeit nutzen m glichst viele sportler kennenzulernen allzu viel wei ich nat rlich nicht von den deutschen medaillenchancen
1593724 mir ist klar dass das schon ein kleiner traditionsbruch ist schlie lich bin ich zum ersten mal dabei ein staffellauf w r auch witzig gewesen jeder l uft ne viertelrunde oder so
1593725 da spielst du dann airhockey gegen irgendeinen pakistani der war richtig gut
1593726 wenn ich zum training nach bamberg muss fahre ich ein bisschen schnell das h lt die fahne nicht aus
1593727 ob ich da als erster oder letzter reingehe ist egal das ist der moment von dem ich getr umt habe seit ich zehn oder elf jahre alt bin seit ich olympia schaue so m ssen wir nicht stundenlang im stadion rumstehen sondern k nnen hinten noch ein bisschen zusammensitzen und dann volle power einmarschieren und dann wirds mir eiskalt den buckel runterlaufen
1593728 wir m ssen aufpassen dass wir nicht als selbstbesch ftiger angesehen werden
1593729 ob dies eine r ckkehr zu den verhassten prinzipien der agenda bedeuten k nnte
1593730 today we are here to celebrate j rgen mangors 50 years with us but we are also celebrating the evolution of copenhagen airport if we look back at 1958 there were 300 employees today we have 1900 back then the airport served about 1 4 million passengers per year and 5000 passengers on the busiest day of the year today we have more than 21 million passengers a year and 79 000 passengers on a busy summer day however there are also areas where things have gone downhill in 1958 we had 133 acres of farm land and harvested 1200 tonnes of grain per year so weve had to say goodbye to commercial revenue from that source
1593731 if we continue to grow at the same pace as we have done over the past 50 years copenhagen airport will be serving 340 million passengers in 2058 and fuel that is co2 neutral will have made airline tickets even cheaper than they are today of course it is difficult to predict things especially the future but that tells us something about how long 50 years actually is
1593732 i handled my first vip job when i was young and worked as an airport officer this led to good relations with embassies all over the world as well as the danish royal court and the police some of the biggest events at the airport i was involved in were visits to denmark by bill clinton george bush and nelson mandela during my 50 year career at the airport i have held at least 20 different positions the airport has always been a major part of my life as well as my hobby

1593738 we want to educate the public about the value of advanced care planning documents
1593739 the point is if you cant speak for yourself what would you like to have happen
1593740 the gundersen lutheran program is not just filling out a form its creating a plan
1593741 there have been studies conducted testing the model and there has been a very good success rate with it
1593742 weve all been shooting to get these kids in earlier but only god knows exactly when theyll get in
1593743 this situation is developing on a minute by minute basis
1593744 that requires us to make decisions on a minute by minute basis
1593745 do you realize the cost youre facing if this fails
1593746 itll be worst of a bad situation we need to get this building finished at all costs and if that means a little extra money and a little extra time thats okay
1593747 i think that the restaurant from a design point of view will be very exciting and cutting edge
1593748 it should really do an awful lot for that riverside community
1593749 its going to be different from the delamar in many ways
1593750 this is a place that a younger guest who is more on a budget would enjoy and that would apply to the business traveler too
1593751 i think that we tried awfully hard to make the delamar as good as we could given the constraints on the site and what we were allowed to do from a planning and zoning standpoint weve learned a few things
1593752 we are confident that earnings enhancing acquisitions and further organic growth can be achieved discussions are currently underway with several targets
1593753 this is one of the most mismanaged projects in the history of the town its pathetic
1593754 i would be surprised and shocked if theyre done before thanksgiving break
1593755 we want it to be done just as much as they do
1593756 it would be good to have the full service library back
1593757 its just an inconvenience because sometimes they dont have the books here
1593758 i am determined to resolve the difficulties in our u s life business and to return it to a proper level of profitability
1593759 as a result of the recent slowdown in the television advertising market the board has taken some tough decisions which are reported here today
1593760 as far as possible predators are concerned great interest centres on sky news owner bskybs controversial stake in the firm
1593761 rumours have been fuelled by an appeal court ruling due shortly which could force bskyb to sell its controversial 17 9 stake in itv to less than 7 5
1593762 big brother producer endemol the german parent of five rtl and italys mediaset are all seen as possible buyers
1593763 the one thing they cant do without the initiative is the one thing theyre not telling the voters about the repeal of the sunset provision
1593764 id go around every payday pay all these lenders just to extend the loan
1593765 i got in the payday loan roulette wheel i couldnt get out of it
1593766 i guess theyre doing it legally but people are going to get trapped
1593767 theyre almost all willing to work with you when youre in a budget crisis
1593768 i found all this out after it was too late
1593769 people know at a gut level that 400 percent interest rates are bad for the consumer and bad for the economy
1593770 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1593771 cases like these send a clear message to those who might be tempted to abuse our computer networks to steal information and harm law abiding people and businesses
1593772 even if it becomes a consolidated subsidiary sony bmg would make a negligible contribution to this years operating profits as it has current year restructuring costs of 140 million
1593773 the russian company will build a tire plant with an initial annual capacity of around 4 2 million car and industrial vehicle tires
1593774 i am still a buyer at much below 120 on a 12 24 month view we may see 150 this winter but i would be more confident about that on a two year view
1593775 we could see 100 in the next two months at the rate were falling
1593776 short of problems in the middle east or hurricanes i think were going to continue to fall
1593777 i think below 100 could be a possibility in the next two months
1593778 its dropped nearly 30 so far from the highs so its only got to go another 18
1593779 we expect the downward correction to continue in the near term before fundamentals reassert
1593780 we believe that the crude price could test levels closer to 110 or below in the near term
1593781 within five years or less the federal government must develop a mandatory system that works uniformly across all 50 states
1593782 97 year old people have the right to vote think a little before you start hating
1593783 the law is unjust and needs to be written in a manner more responsible and responsive
1593784 it takes big men to talk down to an old woman
1593785 leave it to a democrat to wait until the last possible moment to work things out then blame it on someone else
1593786 in order to get beyond racism we must first take account of race
1593787 john mccain has always been opposed to government mandated hiring quotas because he believes that regardless of race ethnicity or gender the law should be equally applied
1593788 we believe that the arizona racing industry should provide revenue for this purpose
1593789 had never filed arizona individual income tax returns and c amp z management lllc had never filed arizona partnership income tax returns
1593790 according to the latest balances exports are seen at 17 5 million tons
1593791 we have a sharp increase in grain supply and the exports should be encouraged but on the other hand the government is trying to support local prices
1593792 we have about 23 million tonnes of wheat and most of it is feed wheat
1593793 due to a different interpretation of standards no one can say how much food grain ukraine has
1593794 the standards must be upgraded from today we must guard against any chaos
1593795 its a disaster and poses an even greater danger than floods in western ukraine
1593796 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
1593797 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1593798 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1593799 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1593800 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
1593801 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
1593802 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
1593803 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
1593804 we did find some areas where although he initially resisted he came around
1593805 it was a classic strategy of giving the president things he doesnt want in bills he has to have
1593806 in the eighth year of the presidency and in this environment bushs veto was pretty strong
1593807 he had to compromise and he had to do it in two ways either they negotiated out a compromise or he was pushed into a compromise politically because of where the votes were
1593808 the president doesnt get involved much with what goes on around here
1593809 talking about a second stimulus package right now is premature
1593810 well fight if we must but wed much rather dance
1593811 i cannot think of a more misguided irresponsible suggestion than tom sanders idea of reducing the cost of cigarettes for our military personnel cigarettes are dangerous and habit forming price is a disincentive that helps preserve the tenuous health environment in which they live and fight we now are seeing the tragic results of cheap cigarettes during world war ii with the epidemic of lung cancer emphysema and heart disease among our veterans would we subsidize cocaine and other dangerous drugs hopefully the responsible health officers will put a stop to such foolishness david r sanderson m d scottsdale higher expectations u s could do worse good lord obama has raised expectations
1593812 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1593813 i am not a racist ive never made a racist comment and i didnt attack obama personally
1593814 played the race card and played it from the bottom of the deck
1593815 a significant decline in the number of less educated hispanic immigrations
1593816 there is good evidence that recent immigration enforcement efforts are a key factor causing the decline
1593817 he is a very healthy and strong five year old goat with a clean white coat long beard and good pair of horns
1593818 maddy and claiming to have been taken from her mother was seen in
1593819 tragic this kind of information should only be released now
1593820 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on he said
1593821 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1593822 if that hasnt been done that is exactly the kind of information that the private investigators are going to follow up
1593823 kate was not aware of these e fits nor is she aware of what happened to the dutch sighting they were never told anything about it or whether any of these sightings were followed up properly that is the most frustrating thing
1593824 all this information which could be used by the investigators could also help the abductor the friend said
1593825 what other country does this in a criminal case it is quite amazing that they have done this
1593826 there are a lot of people that still have a view of kate and gerry and it is a concern

1593831 at certain times this season i had my problems when it came to getting the maximum out of the car
1593832 but it is beneficial having the data and knowing that robert gets on very well with it it is also good seeing that in the races my performances have quite often been similar to roberts i would call him a good benchmark at the moment
1593833 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
1593834 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1593835 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi
1593836 it seems that the american political leadership has now determined to deal with pakistan in a more substantial way
1593837 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
1593838 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi
1593839 what is at stake is itvs position as one of the three pillars of uk broadcasting alongside the bbc and bskyb
1593840 robert peston does a sterling job of explaining complex issues in a simple manner
1593841 i dont normally post on uk issues or economics but this interview by robert peston of jean claude trichet is well worth a read
1593842 as ever the bbcs robert peston gives us some of the most incisive comment
1593843 an interesting article by robert peston argues that banks may be too private
1593844 the most important announcement by itv today is that it has halved its interim dividend to 0 675p the painful cut
1593845 i agree with allmymarbles and those who have pointed out that obama hitting back is not frankly a very impressive
1593846 the police in chinas xinjiang region can serve a very good cup of tea at two in the morning i
1593847 theres no way they could be sisters and exchange clothes
1593848 you use accessories to make your wardrobe more exciting if youre not buying new clothes then youre investing in new jewelry even if its costume jewelry
1593849 both michelle and cindy are channeling jackie o they wear streamlined clothing with pearls
1593850 you can look severe and bare if youre not wearing a necklace which makes you look feminine and elegant
1593851 a necklace should fit into the neckline of the dress the green with the mixed pearls looked good but the neckline is too high and theres too much detail around it
1593852 thats a phenomenal dress and the pearls too theres just a little bit much going on between the pearls and the belt
1593853 im not sure if pearls are the best choice because i dont think of her as being traditional
1593854 if you have on a major belt stay away from a big necklace and dont wear a huge earring with the huge necklace
1593855 theres always usually a feeling of coming back to a tournament youve won once or even more times like in this case
1593856 you always feel pretty good about your game so in one way it is surprising for myself but on the other hand maybe you dont want it as bad as winning another title
1593857 the summer by my standards hasnt been going that well
1593858 i felt i had a lot more expectations for myself and i wasnt doing that well to get a win here and to beat someone of his caliber is great
1593859 a lot of double faults started to roll in i have been up on a player like that before but i hadnt closed it before it was just different territory for me
1593860 were actually quite pleased with the momentum at myspace for q1 were pacing well against internal expectations
1593861 key thing id say we believe that we are still in a scale game business
1593862 our expectation is that we will continue to grow our margins in the fim business in 09
1593863 asias potential and that of its people will be rewarded many many times over
1593864 on an absolute level the user or user generated content is competitive we live in a world of infinite choice our job as programmers is to make sure that our programming is compelling i dont want to pretend it doesnt exist but its just one more competitive drop in the bucket others are video games mobile
1593865 were working very hard to offer advertisers segregation opportunities so they dont have to advertise
1593866 one of the things we feel good about is the growth of hulu were now a top ten site 3 million uniques i dont necessarily look at hulu as competitive with the broadcast networks
1593867 we are still reviewing the ruling we were part of the ruling that appealed the original ruling so we obviously had a strong position historically you could assume we werent in favor of it

1593957 i see the olympics and the opening ceremonies as a chance to symbolize an important transformation in chinas self image
1593958 for most of the 20th century china viewed itself as a weak and vulnerable country that has been denied its historical place in the sun
1593959 it was bullied by foreign powers and it drew upon the legalist tradition to ruthlessly strengthen the state and mobilize the people for that purpose now that its more powerful and has begun to re establish its deserved place in the sun it can relax a bit and the traditional confucian ways of soft power can begin to reassert themselves

1594014 he was our scrapper theres no question about it he always seemed to be on base always seemed to be pushing the edges trying to take another base he scored more runs than anybody in the league he did everything youd want out of a leadoff guy
1594015 if i had to pick one guy who had the most just big hits in games to turn the tide of the game

1594041 we will take the scores into consideration and make some adjustments

1594595 ayurveda believes poor nutrition is the main cause of disease so food is used to heal and prevent illness
1594596 theres a methodology of structured diets according to an individuals specific metabolic function
1594597 the reason ayurveda is successful and i think this is the teleological aspect of it is that it doesnt try to fit the nutritional aspect into a one size fits all category
1594598 thats the difference between ayurveda and other nutrition systems out there its not just saying this is good and this is bad for everyone out there its a very individualized diet program for every person that walks through the door

1594602 only a fraction of shipments of iron ore and coal are handled by south african shipping companies
1594603 with the support of african renaissance and our co investors mbc will be able to expand its involvement in iron ore and coal shipments of close to a 100 million tons per year
1594604 it will offer mcs the opportunity to expand its job creation programmes while in the dry bulk operation of mbc it will strengthen our relationship with the mining sector
1594605 the fact that they do not even know that a bigger customs union is being planned shows that their ideas have not been solicited
1594606 this is because these smaller members of sacu do not benefit much from the protective function of the external tariff regime because almost all the industries protected by the tariff regime are located in south africa which is the dominant member of sacu the revenue sharing formula is therefore being used to appease the blns countries so that they do not make noise about the skewed distribution of industries within sacu
1594607 the establishment of a broader sadc customs union is bound to impact positively on the blns countries in two important ways first it will enable the blns countries to diversify sources of their imports currently these countries get good proportions of their imports from south africa because of the current protective tariff wall created by the sacu external tariff regime
1594608 we will have access to a bigger market a bigger customs union will bring about stiffer competition among producers of goods and services which in turn will lead to higher productivity and efficiency the scales of production will be in favour of everyone in the region
1594609 sacu led to the integrated and coordinated economic development of its members even though a certain polarisation whereby big businesses are concentrated in south africa took place revenue shared among sacu countries has not just helped those countries fiscally but has given them the chance to develop economically it is up to the political leaders in those countries to use the revenue to develop their countries
1594610 this is the reality of the situation and until there is a bigger union there is no use trying to against thunder however i think this polarisation will end once there is a bigger customs union but sadc countries need to develop the skills of their people and do something about their production capacity to survive the impending competition
1594611 south african products are cheaper than products from smaller sacu countries which have relied on south african products to satisfy their domestic needs it is therefore impossible for products from smaller sacu members to compete with south african products even in their own domestic markets leave alone the south african market
1594612 theoretically a broader regional integration will increase the market and increase prospects for economic growth and development

1594634 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1594635 broader action beyond retailers alone is required to protect consumer data banks and the us payment card industry must join retailers and work together
1594636 there are thousands of conduits to customer data security isnt working and tjx is the poster child of a big data breach
1594637 what is needed is a different approach to secure that data far more directly where it lives
1594638 we instituted significant system upgrades and we are continuously employing measures to help protect data against the ever increasing sophistication of thieves

1594647 we admit that some things at the show didnt go according to plan initially we wanted to help less privileged children and after we had questioned ourselves how we would go about doing it that is how we finally settled on hosting this fundraising show
1594648 i could tell that some of the artistes performing at the show were not happy about some things although they didnt say it out but we hope our second show will be better than the first one
1594649 we cant say we managed to fulfil the objective to some extent considering that the turnout was very low to say that we raised such and such an amount would be a blue lie but all i can say is that we incurred a lot of expenses we paid some of the artistes while some performed for free

1594654 yes i have been up on the top floor of high rise condos and seen sharks lined up like cord wood 500 yards out just beyond the second sandbar
1594655 yes ive seen a few but the ones that come in close are usually small nurse sharks trying to travel from point a to point b so just get out of their way besides they only feed at sunset so if you dont go in the water when it is getting dark you will be ok
1594656 but just to be safe leave your shiny jewelry on the beach
1594657 yes they are around but at the beach you stand a better chance of being killed by a falling vending machine than by a shark
1594658 vern look at that honey in the red thong think toppling this coke machine will get her attention
1594659 yes i have been up on the top floor of high rise condos and seen sharks lined up like cord wood 500 yards out just beyond the second sandbar
1594660 yes ive seen a few but the ones that come in close are usually small nurse sharks trying to travel from point a to point b so just get out of their way besides they only feed at sunset so if you dont go in the water when it is getting dark you will be ok
1594661 but just to be safe leave your shiny jewelry on the beach
1594662 yes they are around but at the beach you stand a better chance of being killed by a falling vending machine than by a shark

1594664 i told him it was something i wanted to do and he supported it it was a great relief
1594665 i actually feel pretty good i dont feel too bad its hard to figure because im swinging at good pitches im just not making consistent contact like i was earlier this year
1594666 you dont see him struggle for long long periods of time you have not seen that berkman swing i know a lot of it is he just hasnt had time off
1594667 i guess im susceptible to these streaks in my career
1594668 im not sure why but its certainly one of those things that makes you scratch your head you cant go out there and try to hit the ball out of the ballpark you try to make good swings usually you run into droughts here and there but i havent done that in a while
1594669 obviously theres been injuries that have been very scary with people getting hit in the face with baseballs and stuff like that
1594670 as far as weather you have to consider this one the scariest
1594671 you dont think about that stuff when youre out there playing you dont think about how hard it is because once you start thinking about it and everything else youre immediately taking yourself out of the game because youre worried about slipping
1594672 im still a little sore but i felt better i took fly balls felt like i could move from side to side better
1594673 a friend of mine was killed by lightning this year any of us could have gotten hit and i wasnt going to play again so i sprinted off the field
1594674 everybody was at risk everybody its not like it was just a slippery field and the players had a chance to get hurt everybody was at risk what if that had hit the stands
1594675 our job is to try to get the game in
1594676 you do the best you can do at the time i understand players dont want to be out there i dont want to be out there
1594677 there was no need to be out there when the lightning is that close
1594678 theres really only two options if youre out in something like that you either have never seen a lightning storm before or youre a complete idiot
1594679 i dont want to accuse the people that were hanging out in the stands and stuff of being idiots but i guess theyve never seen lightning well think about it people get killed by lightning strikes all the time its not likely to happen but its a heck of a lot more likely if youre standing outside in a lightning storm its one of those things where if a tragedy ends up happening its because people dont have respect for it nobody thats ever been struck by lightning probably thought theyd be struck by lightning
1594680 once berkman told me about biggios friend i was worried
1594681 look im back there with all that equipment out there
1594682 no matter what decision you make somebodys not going to be happy to me bell did an incredible job
1594683 im not trying to put in on cubs general manager jim hendry or anything like that but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1594684 youve got reports of severe weather youve got to keep some perspective here
1594685 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that but at the same time dont lose your mind youve got tornado sirens going off and severe weather all over the place theres no reason for it theres no reason to put fans at risk theres no reason to put players at risk
1594686 you put umpires in a bad spot because everybodys like well its on them theyve got to make the call i mean theyre getting all kinds of pressure so i dont blame them
1594687 i think somebodys got to step up in a situation like that and say look yes we all want to win a world series here we all want to make the playoffs but there comes a point and time when youve got to just say stop i guess in our modern day of technology people say oh well the radar says this well im standing outside there and i can see the lightning hit the firehouse 100 yards behind the stadium so i dont need radar to tell me that
1594688 as a matter of fact it acted like the first foul ball the first fastball that he fouled off
1594689 it was at 90 mph or 91 mph so i know i overthrew it i missed my spot he got it
1594690 i didnt feel comfortable on the mound but in the last three innings i felt better
1594691 chris just got some balls up there in the seventh to give up those two base hits
1594692 other than that i thought he pitched well if he stays down hell be really good for us
1594693 we couldnt make some pitches there in the seventh and it came back to haunt us a little bit but we keep battling we had an outstanding day from an offensive standpoint
1594694 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
1594695 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
1594696 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

1594723 a draft report by the national institute of standards and technology made public today reaffirms my belief that there are serious questions about the security and reliability of paperless electronic voting machines it further demonstrates the importance of moving forward with new legislation to require that there be an independent paper record of every ballot i plan to introduce that legislation at the beginning of the new congress and hold hearings soon after with the intent of moving the bill to the senate floor as soon as possible as weve seen in where officials have been unable to account for about 18 000 undervotes in the congressional election it is crucial that there be an independent record that can be reviewed by election officials one third of voters cast their ballots in the midterm election using new electronic voting machines and problems arose not only in florida but in various jurisdictions across the country we must do everything we can to restore confidence in the outcomes of elections by helping to ensure that every vote cast by an american citizen is recorded accurately and that every eligible voter can in fact cast a ballot

1594752 the ratings on lebanon were raised to reflect the easing of tensions between the march 14th coalition which dominated the government and the opposition that in may had taken lebanon to the brink of civil conflict
1594753 the doha accord which has delivered the election of a president and the formation of a national unity cabinet augurs well for lebanons immediate political stability
1594754 this reduces the risk that depositors will withdraw funds from the lebanese banking sector which in turn lessens the governments near term financing risks as banks are by far the governments largest creditors
1594755 the ratings will be lowered should political tensions escalate to the extent that they seem likely to shake the long documented resilience of depositors in the lebanese banking sector
1594756 the ratings could be raised if the political compact strengthens to the point where the government begins to make progress in advancing the program of economic reforms pledged at the paris iii conference

1594799 the biggest pair of policy bums the country has ever had
1594800 not made one valuable structural change in the 12 years he was treasurer
1594801 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister howard stay there for so long he said
1594802 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have to go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader
1594803 friendly takeover if dr nelson stands aside according to news ltd reports
1594804 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party mr keating said
1594805 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us
1594806 peter costello stated his intentions at the end of last year and if he seeks to change those intentions hes entitled to do so but he can do so in his own time mr turnbull told abc radio

1594812 apparently bild a newspaper in germany hires 14 year old starry eyed fan girls as reporters instead of serious grown ups or at least one would be excused in thinking this reporter was a rock star struck teeny bopper upon reading her gushingly immature account of having an exercise workout with barack obama on the german leg of his trip

1594840 the problem becomes even stickier in film criticism with a feminist point of view where the delights of the specialist often collide with the despairs of the ideologue the critic and the feminist in me join hands to protect their respectability against a romantic a slobbery atavistic soul ready to sabotage all their deliberations with a few convulsive sobs

1594843 one of broadway historys more peculiar entries a crossbreed of high culture and low the music which included the songs stranger in paradise and baubles bangles and beads was adapted from the symphonic scores of alexander borodin but the story a florid fable set in baghdad at the time of the arabian nights was replete with groan worthy double entendres and staged with grand spectacle and lots of leggy harem girls
1594844 i ask you therefore will you love her honour and keep her and be faithful to her so long as you both shall live
1594845 with regards to the pakistani intelligence services i think thats been historically an issue in that country there are signs that it remains so and we our collect our two governments are working to deal with those problems
1594846 very very small numbers of us special forces are operating in a training capacity in pakistan not out on joint missions but on a fixed site training pakistani forces at the invitation of the pakistani government
1594847 we have seen and continue to see pakistani military operations in the fata and we are pleased to see that but this needs to be a concerted and consistent effort to go after the militants to prevent them from either creating training grounds and safe havens within pakistan or going into afghanistan and causing trouble there
1594848 so there clearly are increased military operations weve seen that we are pleased by it we need to continue to see it and we need to see probably even more robust efforts on the pakistans part
1594849 the australian federal police afp was in the process of compiling a public version of its submission devoid of sensitive information supplied to the afp by the london metropolitan police service
1594850 my understanding is that they are trying to comply with clarkes request
1594851 they have said they are working on it but i have no idea on timing or anything like that
1594852 we would not want to do anything including authorising the publication of any documents which could potentially compromise the integrity of those proceedings
1594853 it is also likely that some of the information that is currently protected will be disclosed during the course of the british prosecutions
1594854 you cant hide behind this smokescreen of the secret british information imagine if the boot was on the other foot

1594857 dont worry about the people or things from your past theres a reason that they didnt make it to your future
1594858 there is going to be from mid afternoon some scattered thundery showers and it is possible the conditions will be right for a few isolated tornados
1594859 but generally in this country tornados are not that big and do not cause that much damage
1594860 there will be wind sheers in the upper atmosphere and that helps to generate the risk of thunder storms and they could create some very gusty winds that might not necessarily be classed as a tornado
1594861 we could see an inch of rain falling as a result of a thunder storm in one place while there could be only a half inch a few miles away these are going to be very localised but the ones that develop could be very heavy suffolk homes
1594862 due to the rising price of fresh meat we are unable to offer the steak on our menu at present
1594863 we are also unable to offer the fresh fish ipa platter we are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause
1594864 its a great pub and i love coming in but there are not many pubs who do food and dont offer a steak i have enjoyed some absolutely beautiful cuts in pubs and people will expect it
1594865 most of them come frozen in this day and age a few may have fresh meat delivered i cant see any sense in not serving them
1594866 trade is bad enough these days for pubs this is a traditional choice if people have it they feel they have had a good meal people always want them i love my steaks and they are very popular
1594867 i cant understand this but i am sure if people enjoy the pub they will find something else to eat the proprietors may change their mind in time
1594868 this was a decision made by an individual house manager and it was not a business directive from the company
1594869 we continue to offer steak across our managed estate but we also give house managers the flexibility to alter their food offering depending on the particular requirements of the business
1594870 in respect of the fish platter this was taken off the menu because of a problem with the pubs equipment suffolk homes
1594871 police are following up four enquires from members of the public as a result of the alleged incident all of these people will be spoken to and information will be collected and then we will decide on the next course of action
1594872 he was not very nice i was shocked because i had my daughter there and there were other kids around in the same area
1594873 from our point of view we are aware of an alleged incident if we are asked too we will give 100 cooperation to the police
1594874 we will help the police if requested too but at the moment we have not heard from them if we are contacted by the police we will act accordingly
1594875 were keeping all lines of inquiry open but records have shown that in cases where school fires have been started deliberately a high proportion have been started by ex pupils
1594876 we used the turntable ladder as a kind of water tower the crews worked extremely hard
1594877 the main job was to not make the incident any worse and ensure the safety of fire fighters and that no one was injured
1594878 we have asked scenes of crime investigators to visit the scene which is standard practice but a fire of this severity is unusual and we are keeping all options open at this stage
1594879 i have been trying to speak to as many members of staff and the governing body and everyone is saying that the school seems beyond repair on a personal level i am devastated as both my children went to the school there is this sense of immense sadness and loss

1594890 the petrol fg falcon sedan range has been judged by ancap as being the safety leader amongst locally manufactured vehicles cementing fords long standing reputation for safety leadership in australia
1594891 we design our cars to deliver real world safety benefits for our customers this result is a resounding third party endorsement of the extensive safety development program undertaken for the all new fg falcon
1594892 not only is the fg falcon the safest vehicle ever produced in this country it is also competitive with the safest sedans in the world
1594893 these safety test results add further validation to the extensive crash simulation process and physical crash test program conducted by ford australia for the fg falcon which was the most comprehensive in the companys history
1594894 now leads the pack in safety for the large australian made family car
1594895 this is an improvement on the previous falcon but there is still plenty of room for improving pedestrian protection

1594911 more than a dozen christians in saudi arabia who were accused by government officials of worshipping in their homes have been ordered deported
1594912 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
1594913 a few of my friends and i thought too much was being made of this olympic torch business it was being treated as a god whereas in fact it was originally invented by the nazis for the berlin games in 1936 so we got a chair leg some silver paint and an old plum pudding can and we made our own torch

1594941 like all other armies mk umkhonto we sizwe had rules about dealing with mutineers
1594942 despite the fact that one of the mutineers had hunted down wounded cadres the morning after the mutiny began finishing them off
1594943 in a drunken state they randomly shot at shoppers at a local market killing two angolan women and seriously injuring another woman and child
1594944 unfortunately this kind of problem is a very difficult one it is a kind of problem that manifests itself in places such as camps that are very far from home and isolated in hostile areas
1594945 the confinement of men and women resulted in these abuses
1594946 i think it is understood what is meant by favours
1594947 any abuse of women that took place was not part and parcel of every day occurrence this is something that would have been hidden
1594948 when it was brought to our attention that certain abuses were taking place behind the scenes we took action
1594949 these young girls were abused by the officers mostly the administrators they used to call them to administration and then do what they wanted
1594950 some of the trainees came with their girlfriends and wives even those wives were abused
1594951 when chris hani was appointed army commissar we thought here is someone who will listen to us but we were never given a chance to speak to him we were always told he was in a hurry

1594959 if south africas vicious farm murders had occurred in zimbabwe these would have been world news but these only occurred in south africa and so the rest of the world remains oddly silent post apartheid south africa is apparently immune from the usual investigative journalism being conducted in the rest of the western world
1594960 why has the south african farmer become the worlds most endangered species
1594961 why are south africas few remaining commercial farmers now most at risk of being murdered in the whole world
1594962 more than 1 million hectares less maize is also being harvested this year the entire region with its 120 million people is also plunging headlong into widespread famine and all these facts are not unrelated
1594963 imagine the uproar if afrikaners were to start chanting kill the xhosas kill the blacks
1594964 the situation is out of control where are these farmers going to run to
1594965 it might indeed be a good idea for the u s congress to hold hearings on the farm killings and extend visas to the boers to go live in the united states
1594966 we dont care about what you are doing wrong but i am right and im going to put up with your wrongness because thats the spiritual thing to do

1594970 the groups technological infrastructure has been fundamentally overhauled by our technology partners scientific games and orbis

1594977 what constitutes the proper experience needed to be a career expert

1594979 it is not good for children to get personal information in that way

1594983 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1594984 initially we intended to use the roof to support the 18 separate cable trajectories radiating from the central hub
1594985 but instead we designed our own custom towers to support the net
1594986 we worked out all the sequencing movements and timing using 3d modelling and a computer animation produced by gareth lowe
1594987 then once we had it right we downloaded the animation program to the winch control computers and we were ready to go
1594988 we had a huge area to cover yet the system had to be physically discreet so as not to impede sightlines we opted for the kf860 861 horn loaded virtual line array solution for the simple reason that there is no other product in the world that does what they do in clusters of two
1594989 to achieve the same pattern control and output using conventional line array technology would have necessitated an unacceptably tall array of a minimum of four and possibly even six loudspeakers per stack
1594990 as it was we achieved superb results using just a two cabinet array that met all of our requirements in terms of power output and audio quality and yet remained physically unobtrusive
1594991 we went for the bh760 subs because the greek artistic director wanted to achieve a heartbeat sound effect that would be felt in the 80 000 seat stadium as well as heard and bh760 is second only to the kf960 super sub for delivering what he wanted
1594992 the entire system performed flawlessly from start to finish of both ceremonies

1595016 the idea of a wednesday opening means that you have a jump on the competition
1595017 there seems to be a plethora of them right now

1595021 the dubstep scene grew up on jungle garage drum amp bass and what we all have in common
1595022 its the u k soundsystem culture thats the heritage of the scene and i think were all on quite a futurist vibe but i guess my sound is more jungle inspired more bass driven
1595023 im afraid that i have to admit that im a fan of the jonas brothers
1595024 their tunes are really catchy i embarrass my kids by humming their songs around the house the jonas brothers already are big and theyre going to be huge
1595025 i started watching them with my daughter on the disney channel
1595026 but i didnt buy tickets for the concert until i started to like their music i told my husband that rachel wanted to go to the concert he said no you want to go he got me there
1595027 we were talking about this in the office just the other day
1595028 one of my colleagues is in her late 20s and she says that her friends of the same age are obsessed with the jonas brothers maybe its just a way to relive their youths to remember what it felt like when they were in high school and had a crush on the members of a boy band i grew up in the 80s and i loved duran duran when the original five members reunited a few years ago i was thrilled
1595029 i dont think the songs will be among the hundred greatest songs of the 21st century but its not total fluff its more than just disposable pop
1595030 you definitely need talent too the jonas brothers are sincere about their musical tastes they clearly have their own opinions and history their own aesthetic
1595031 i have a son who is older than both nick and joe grown women can get away with being fans of boy bands if a man my age went to a hannah montana concert people would think he was a pervert
1595032 the fab four initially were considered a palatable parent approved alternative to the rolling stones

1595052 ich erwarte nicht zu gewinnen aber wenn man nichts unternimmt gibt es keine chance die welt da drau en die wahrheit wissen zu lassen es ist eine gelegenheit ber die ungerechte behandlung von tibetern ber die jahre zu sprechen
1595053 sie hat sich auf unbekanntes terrain gewagt ich glaube kein tibeter hat sich je so offen gedruckt oder in den medien ge u ert
1595054 als sie anfing ber diese dinge zu schreiben nahm wohl jeder an dass sie diese haltung nicht lange beibehalten k nnen w rde aber sie hat nie gewankt
1595055 da standen dinge drin die das gegenteil von dem waren was man uns lehrte

1595065 wir m ssen jedoch klar sagen dass dieses ergebnisziel mit unsicherheiten behaftet ist
1595066 herr schlarmann sollte wissen dass die union nicht mit absoluter mehrheit regiert sondern in einer koalition mit den sozialdemokraten frau merkel kann deshalb gar nicht anders als immer wieder auch kompromisse mit der spd einzugehen
1595067 frau merkel hat nach und nach viele christdemokratische positionen aufgegeben und sich als kanzlerin st rker mit der politik der gro en koalition identifiziert f r den bundestagswahlkampf kann das f r die kanzlerin zum problem werden um glaubw rdig f r eine b rgerliche koalition zu werben
1595068 die pauschalen angriffe auf die kanzlerin sind falsch und nicht zu akzeptieren
1595069 die politik mit der spd liefert sicher nicht nur ideale ergebnisse aber man darf auch nicht alles verunglimpfen

1595073 on saturday aug 2 i got to wondering about mac versus windows pc pricing after seeing two hp notebooks on sale at the local target one of them a 14 inch model the hp dv2946nr sold for 699 99 and packed 4gb of memory and a 320gb hard drive capacity for both features is twice that of the 1 299 macbook and shared graphics is 356mb compared with a meager 144mb for the macbook i wondered if vista notebooks are selling for so little and packing so much how does this compare with mac desktops and notebooks today i contacted stephen baker npds vice president of industry analysis about computer average selling prices at retail that hp notebook is right on mark asp for retail windows notebooks is 700 mac laptops 1 515 yeah right theyre more than twice as much but theres more the asp for mac desktops is more than 1 000 greater than for windows pcs and mac desktop asps were higher in june than they were two years ago
1595074 officers are continuing to look through hours of cctv footage which covers the local area in an effort to gain further information on the attack

1595080 do i think we should have a team representing football in the 2012 olympics yes
1595081 we have to respect their views but this is an olympics that is going to take place in london in four years time and i think youll get from my view that theres an appetite for us to have a team
1595082 didnt we win a hockey gold medal in 1988 with all english players and one northern irish player there is precedent
1595083 while it is still somewhat unclear what assumptions are driving marvels film production guidance the contribution from the film slate in 2008 and lifetime appears to be about 60 of what we were expecting on a revenue basis and at a lower margin
1595084 like most crops truffles need water and warmth and thats what weve had this summer there are lots of truffles and we have found them up to 500g each bigger than cricket balls
1595085 we had a look at some three weeks ago but they werent right they had grown slowly because of the spring cold however since then we have had lots of rain which has helped them grow and it has also been humid so they are doing very well
1595086 they have got a couple of really old trees in the garden and we were just clearing out this wooded area when i came across this truffle it was about 7cm long as we carried on working we found about nine to 10 truffles
1595087 i would think there would be more in the garden and there are some more beech trees in neighbouring gardens i think it would be worth looking
1595088 it would take you a day to find a kilo of truffles in france
1595089 the key is we dont dig the truffles out we wait until they come to the surface and we only pick 30 or 40 of what is there
1595090 ich glaube es wird schwierig auch wenn es ein komplett neues reglement gibt
1595091 es kann im kommenden jahr verschiebungen geben aber ich habe noch nie ein auto gesehen welches in einem jahr ganz hinten war und dann pl tzlich im darauf folgenden jahr das gesamte feld von hinten aufgerollt hat
1595092 es geht nur schritt f r schritt es ist so unglaublich schwierig die l cke zu schlie en egal ob es um die aerodynamik den motor oder die reifen geht wo auch immer deine probleme liegen wird es extrem hart die l cke zu schlie en
1595093 mal ganz ehrlich es wird schwierig die topteams zu berholen und ein auto zu bauen welches besser ist als deren wagen
1595094 sie sagen viele gute und positive dinge und ich erkenne das an aber ich konzentriere mich immer noch auf dieses jahr wir werfen noch lange nicht das handtuch sondern werden bis zur letzten runde k mpfen
1595095 alles in allem ist die finanzkrise noch nicht zum stillstand gekommen und wird auch das zweite halbjahr 2008 beeintr chtigen
1595096 angesichts weiter volatiler m rkte gehen wir nach wie vor davon aus dass es ohne ber cksichtigung des steuerertrags sehr schwer werden d rfte im gesamtjahr das gute ergebnis des vorjahres zu erreichen
1595097 it can be total hassle when youre organising a bunch of friends to go to the theatre or on a holiday someone has to play the role of organiser and sometimes they have a very hard time sorting the money side out often they have to pay for everything upfront and then what happens if people pull out
1595098 we needed cost effective but good developers because were not just a soft and fluffy website we have a hardcore payments platform behind it so we were specific about the type of expertise we needed to find
1595099 we looked in lots of different places china india various places in eastern europe the uk the guys in bulgaria referenced very well and weve had a really good experience working with them
1595100 its very common to have an offshore development team because having it onshore is so much more expensive when youre a startup you dont have a lot of money to spend and you become very cost conscious
1595101 oh brother is this guy for real or is he all about the press leading many many readers on

1595103 we want candidates with criminal records to be barred from contesting elections for that the government has to pass a law which has not been done yet there is a need to do a lot more to see criminals are barred from elections
1595104 its like the practice in chinese tradition of having all parts of the world come to pay tribute
1595105 the olympics also lets your own people know that the rest of the world confers legitimacy on and supports the government
1595106 knowing that the chinese would take stock of those decisions very few statesmen could avoid showing up
1595107 the chinese leadership has signaled that coming earns points for the countries concerned
1595108 we feel better at least there is someone around that you can trust and knows how to help you
1595109 if you look around and see the soldiers you automatically feel safer
1595110 i believe we are on the right track to guarantee more safety for citizens to give them the feeling that the state is there and it is serious about fighting crime
1595111 the soldiers make you feel safer but its sad that we need them
1595112 i think it is a good measure as long as it is temporary
1595113 if it lasted longer it would give me a sense of militarization
1595114 no one is afraid of the military but to use them in cities is a media move to cover up the cuts to security forces
1595115 our soldiers are highly professional but they are not trained to maintain public order
1595116 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1595117 this accident is a very sad and disastrous event in our mountaineering history
1595118 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1595119 to the extent that people arent able to do that people arent able to worship freely is you know i think is a mistake
1595120 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons
1595121 i really dont know i dont think either of us knows
1595122 i have faith we will be able to move to the verification process then to the next step
1595123 fully verify the extent to which he has had a highly enriched uranium program
1595124 theres still more steps to be done on the plutonium program
1595125 in order to get off the list the axis of evil list the north korean leader is going to have to make certain decisions
1595126 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists
1595127 they are committed to helping north korea integrate into the international community and thereby partake in the peace and prosperity on the korean peninsula and in northeast asia

1595137 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1595143 del resto che altro potevano fare i miei con un malaticcio come me
1595144 non potevo correre e affaticarmi non potevo giocare quando faceva troppo caldo non potevo fare niente mi portavano a scuola mi riprendevano mi davano da mangiare e poi non mi rimaneva che la sala buia e fresca dei cinema del quartiere io adoravo i film di qualsiasi genere e quando poi giunse il technicolor per me fu un momento magico ancora di pi di quando arriv il cinecolor tutto quello che avrei fatto dopo nel cinema io lo vedo come un costante ritorno alla memoria sensuale di quella magia che emanava il grande schermo quando assistevo ai primi b movies di hollywood con il colore ancora sgranato e lerba che blu come i campi di barbabietole quella magia che ancora adesso mi seduce e ammalia
1595145 pi che un giallo uno studio caratteriale e il racconto di un periodo fondamentale nella psichiatria
1595146 il film ambientato negli anni 50 perch in quegli anni almeno in america avvenne lo scisma tra due scuole di psichiatria diametralmente opposte una faceva perno sullaggressiva medicalizzazione del disturbo psichico inclusi lelettroshock e la lobotomia a new york cera perfino un laboratorio ambulante per eseguire lobotomie seduta stante laltra scuola quella progressista rappresentata nel film dallo psichiatra interpretato da ben kingsley si opponeva a questi metodi barbarici e allutilizzo di droghe pesanti considerati lequivalente di un suicidio dellanima lapproccio scientifico di questa scuola ha trasformato la psichiatria da quella sorta di tortura medievale che era prima a una vera e propria terapia che umanizzava la cura dei matti insomma per me questo film aspira ad essere un dramma umano con suspense ma a sfondo scientifico

1595177 the big attraction for me was that bangor is closer to home
1595178 the travelling was becoming an ordeal for me it was absolutely starting to grind at me and i wasnt enjoying it
1595179 i was eight and a half years up and down the frosses road and thank god unscathed i just felt that it was time to move on its a lot handier for me now at bangor
1595180 its a new challenge for me at bangor and its the type of challenge i like
1595181 i came through a lot at coleraine and i think i came out of it pretty well
1595182 i know i have left the club in a pretty good state and memories of a few irish cup finals albeit the one in may was a defeat but i have very fond memories of a club that i have a lot of time for and people that i have a lot of time for
1595183 like many things in life i move on and i have accepted the challenge from bangor and the challenge is to keep the club in the premiership
1595184 were not going to kid ourselves thats what its all about for us this season
1595185 the club is very enterprising and very supportive i couldnt ask for anything more
1595186 like everyone else in the league well be aiming for the top six but i see us being in the bottom four
1595187 it will be a good achievement if we stay in the division and i am confident we will but getting into that top six well that will require a miracle
1595188 the party scene involving multiple sexual partners is definitely back in london and probably in most european cities there is metrosexual mixing involving gay bisexual and some heterosexual cases we estimate new hiv infections in gay men in london are running at 3 per cent a year
1595189 people could pop a pill on a friday night and be covered for the whole weekend
1595190 at the moment we are desperate to demonstrate any biological intervention that can prevent hiv that will give us something to work with the numbers of hiv infected people on drugs are increasing which is fantastic but the burden of treating a growing population of hiv infected people is bad enough in the uk and unimaginable for a developing country
1595191 todays move means that symptom free people diagnosed with chlamydia and their partner will be able to get convenient effective treatment from their local pharmacy
1595192 the mhra is keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so and we wish to move on to new areas such as prevention and chronic disease management we know many pharmacists are ready for this too
1595193 for people who are already testing themselves at home it is a really positive step forward
1595194 to pretend we can ever get hold of this without dealing with that the idea of unprotected sexual relations with unlimited numbers of partners i think would be na ve
1595195 you can get the universal treatment the moneys there now if we spend it most effectively but we dont have the health care systems

1595199 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1595200 we believe that this squad is full of quality and plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1595201 im at base camp im truly happy to be here finally and to be alive
1595202 i now realise that theyre all dead theyre all dead
1595203 now i just want to take off my shoes since my feet are hurting something awful
1595204 we hope to arrange a meeting with wilco van rooijen on sunday and we have a list of questions that we want to ask and hopefully well get a full debriefing
1595205 his mother wont have him back but were trying to give her the feeling of love and respect that people in ireland and all over the world had for ger
1595206 in the meantime were fighting off the boredom by playing chess reading sowing repairing stuff chatting with the new neighbours and such like for the most part then we retire in the early evening to the solitary confines of our tents for some lonely ownsome time
1595207 looks like shes lost an amount of weight equivalent to a half dozen micelets and i suppose in the not too distance future we can expect some offspring to be frequenting the dining area
1595208 some of us have taken to serenading her with the ramones sheena is a punk rocker although she seems indifferent to our efforts
1595209 personally i found myself decorating the snow intermittently from camp two to three with ungodly amounts of rejected breakfast more than i remembered consuming
1595210 and by the way thanks to all who sent mail to basecamp thanks mother got the holy water and the sweets the summit couldnt have been a success without it
1595211 the meeting had a humorous tone spirits were high hopes are high it was joked that the next meeting would take place at camp four let luck and good fortune prevail fingers crossed
1595212 everything was going well to camp four and on summit attempt everything went wrong
1595213 everybody has his own responsibility and then some people did not do what they promised
1595214 its a blow in every aspect including the financial side and everything that comes with it
1595215 we just have to face it and get on with it we have a job on our hands to pick everyone up
1595216 there was always a hope that we could pick ourselves up for this game and there was also a matter of pride of playing in europe again
1595217 we enjoyed the run we had last season but we are not going to get one this season and thats a disappointment for us
1595218 the championship is a long way off after a night like tonight ive got enough problems picking everyone up for falkirk on saturday
1595219 you can use all the excuses you want but there should have been enough left in the team to handle this
1595220 no disrespect to kaunas they set their stall out well in both games and there are things we just have to take on board its a huge disappointment for everyone
1595221 as things look at the moment i would say yes but we just have to sit down in the morning and see what happens
1595222 that was the first time my players had played in glasgow with an atmosphere like the one at ibrox
1595223 the first leg for us was the dangerous one because we dont have 40 000 supporters we wanted a good result and 0 0 was a good result for us
1595224 the team always believed it was possible in their home park but rangers were still the favourites before this match
1595225 they are a very strong team and kaunas are a small club our championship is not a very strong championship its very different from scotland
1595226 i must congratulate my players because they have worked fantastically for the last few weeks
1595227 as things look at the moment i would say yes but we just have to sit down in the morning and see what happens
1595228 nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in ledgers home or his body
1595229 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1595230 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss my thoughts are with his family
1595231 everyone has been very eager to help saying what a great guy heath ledger was everyone except mary kate who has refused to speak
1595232 if he had a bottle from a friend was it taken by someone else before police responded that is what is trying to be determined
1595233 there have been some good performances over the last few weeks
1595234 i felt we were really good against southampton we got a great win against porto and then the feyenoord game was excellent
1595235 the different formation worked well against feyenoord weve used it in a few games now and the boys looked comfortable with the system
1595236 myself and massimo donati sat deeper in midfield and that allowed scott brown to get forward with aiden mcgeady and georgios samaras to support jan vennegoor of hesselink
1595237 im sure its given the manager something to think about for the season ahead
1595238 the shape was good and against certain opposition especially in europe it could be really useful
1595239 the manager wanted us to play like a three up front with jan the point sami left and me right
1595240 it was not a free role but you were allowed to drift in when it was on to get on the ball i was happy doing that i played that role when i was younger and i enjoyed it
1595241 we did play well and the midfield were able to get good balls into the strikers and into me as well
1595242 you dont want to go overboard about the result because it was just a pre season game but there was a lot of heart to be taken from that performance
1595243 when you are building up a route the first priority is to build up traffic
1595244 the belfast base is performing well and performing to expectation
1595245 we are where we want to be and quite satisfied
1595246 the damage that was caused to our reputation in the shannon area during three or four months of last year
1595247 recent instances of mps employing their children have raised public concern and dented public confidence
1595248 mps must have the resources to do their work effectively and they must command the confidence respect and trust of the public
1595249 the question is not so much about the technology but what one does with it we have quite definite laws about where cctv can be used but of course with uavs you have much greater ability to gather material in private spaces and this would lead to concern
1595250 if they are used to simply hover to gain random information then that would obviously be a matter of worry and a civil liberty issue
1595251 closely involved with the development of procedures and regulations which allow uavs to operate in national and nato airspace but the committee indicates that the ministry should do more
1595252 in the response to our report we expect the mod to set out why it supports the astraea programme only in an observer role and its future plans with regard to this programme
1595253 satellite images can be affected by clouds and lack of light with uavs you can avoid that by choosing the height at which you fly there is now also google earth but these are often old images out of date there is tremendous potential in material gathered by uavs
1595254 there will obviously be implications for privacy human rights etc that is something the government will have to address and i imagine that there will be protests from some quarters but you certainly cannot blame police and intelligence services for wanting to use them

1595285 i was going there to support athletes and be part of the olympics
1595286 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1595287 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur

1595319 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1595320 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1595393 we have decided not to buy any product from traders in jammu and instead buy products directly from other markets like delhi and amritsar
1595394 we will not cooperate with the traders of jammu anymore we are not going to buy any goods from them we have decided to boycott jammu traders
1595395 we will be directly recruiting about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board
1595396 the direct recruitment for intelligence operations means these staff will be deputed for intelligence gathering only they cannot be transferred for policing duty
1595397 we are yet to decide about the number of officials to be directly recruited at higher levels than sub inspectors
1595398 we have to device a foolproof recruitment procedure for selection of people to create a first of its kind intelligence cadre in the state
1595399 what we want in candidates is they should have an aptitude and inclination for intelligence gathering as they will have to do on that field only
1595400 as stocks open sharply higher there will be tendency to book profits at 4650 or beyond in the nifty or booking profits in the nifty futures and buying the 4700 or the 4800 call may be a better bet real estate banking and power psus will do well

1595402 we will not cooperate with the traders of jammu anymore we are not going to buy any goods from them we have decided to boycott jammu traders
1595403 the situation in the aftermath of economic blockade of the valley and attacks on minority community in jammu has made it clear that it is part of a well thought out conspiracy and the centre is involved in it
1595404 we will continue our struggle for an alternative route to the valley
1595405 four foreigners gathered illegally and we express our strong opposition to that we firmly oppose any attempt to politicise the olympic games
1595406 we are so happy to represent our state and city it is exhilarating to have a national contest of this magnitude jai maharashtra
1595407 the contest was very well organized they were the clear cut winners in mumbai too here too it was neck to neck competition but it was their confidence that got them through
1595408 a quiz based on olympics is a fresh idea it will definitely improve our general knowledge about the olympics
1595409 its a great way of developing an understanding and curiosity about the games im glad children are so excited about such a contest
1595410 its fantastic to see the enthusiasm of the kids and such terrific responses from the teams

1595416 there isnt any blood flowing into the tube everyone seems to be bone dry today
1595417 i guess well have to do the other arm but drink some water first
1595418 im sorry but this is very funny to me i used to be really terrified of needles i would sob and throw tantrums if anyone in a white coat came near me with a needle but now its very funny that i was so scared
1595419 i wouldnt be shunned by the doctors for my hobo like appearance would i
1595420 there are certain factors both domestic and external which may add to slowdown the growth rate but we still think that the growth rate would be between 7 5 to 8 per cent
1595421 i think inflation would moderate by the end of march 2009 it would come down to about 8 per cent by the end of this fiscal
1595422 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardise future treatment for mothers and infants
1595423 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
1595424 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales
1595425 it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
1595426 we have learnt she is not participating after failing a dope test
1595427 i am innocent and i am being targeted this according to me is politics played by shailaja along with the association i wont make such a mistake at all because i dont want to end my career like this
1595428 i have never touched any illegal substance and i have never failed a dope test in my life if all these claims are true i would even go to the extent of ending my life
1595429 she shailaja has played dirty politics with me how can the association recommend her name after she has been dope tested positive almost five times i have had 30 tests and all the tests have been negative these are all tactics adopted by the association to forbid me from participating at beijing
1595430 we did not have any sort of intimation on the withdrawal once a members name is given to the olympic association he or she cannot be substituted only she will go and nobody else can go
1595431 we dont have a copy of the report and the air tickets for the games has also not been provided she has been kept away from getting her ticket and all this is unfair on her part
1595432 la suspension de ce sommet a t d cid e en raison de ces actes de violence de provocation et dintol rance soutenus par des bandes de groupes fascistes conservateurs et r trogrades
1595433 cest un massacre et la responsabilit en revient au seul pr sident evo morales
1595434 ces manifestations ont un fond politique ils veulent que morales perde le r f rendum
1595435 but i think the captaincy might curb his flair as a player
1595436 youve got to look at who will make a difference in the dressing room i thought they might appoint a younger bloke like alastair cook and build him up thats what happened to me
1595437 i am not going to be a wimp and say im not going to do it
1595438 im going to accept this challenge and im going to give it a real good go like i give everything in my life a go
1595439 these players are aware what they need to do and they are right on track in terms of preparations the important thing is the awareness of the situation they know they have an opportunity to win the series
1595440 every guy is aware if he is not fully focussed for the next test it could affect the teams performance
1595441 there is a calm focus about the team and there is a humility about how we are going to go about our business there is no arrogance in the environment
1595442 we were happy with the teams response as they lifted their performance by at least 20 percent in galle
1595443 but the important thing is there is a real awareness about things to achieve in the next test and we have always believed that when this team is firing on all cylinders they can match the best in the world
1595444 there was a tremendous hurt in the team after the loss i think it all started with kumble and from there it filtered down to the rest of the team he is a fantastic leader and fighter
1595445 so to motivate the team to improve their performance by 20 per cent was not really difficult the big challenge now is to see that they maintain it in the third test since they have pulled one back
1595446 the success of any test playing side is how each batsman sticks to his own skill we certainly dont say that sehwag plays like this so the rest of he batsmen need to play like this he plays like that since he has the skill and ability to play like that
1595447 tomorrow is frans last day and were all chipping in to get her something did you want to contribute

1595465 4 000 u s deaths and just a handful of public images
1595466 death and carnage are not the whole story of war there is also heroism and frustration success and setback camaraderie and on occasion atrocity but death and carnage are part of the story and to launder them out of our account of the war would be a disservice
1595467 in 1985 13 year old karen patterson was shot to death in her bed in north charleston s c her killer was a neighbor who had already served 10 years of a life sentence for murdering his half brother charles in 1970 joe atkins cut the pattersons phone lines then entered bearing a machete a sawed off shotgun and a pistol karens parents were chased out of their home by atkins karens mom ran to the atkins home nearby where joe then murdered his adopted father benjamin atkins 75 who had worked to persuade parole authorities to release joe from the life sentence

1595470 what i dont get is why the hell i am out here in the first place can you answer that lucy
1595471 are you really against personal higene because no one can get their hair that glossy without the ability to deny that they smell like the inside of a dead horse
1595472 the easiest answer is your eyes they are rather unique after all not many notice which isnt suprising but you should really worry about those who do we happen to be the most dangerous
1595473 that power isnt just about portraying your mood through your eyes however there is so much more to it than that
1595474 there is enough to get the dark lord interested in you
1595475 apparently the books say that if you think hard enough you can kill someone point blank
1595476 youre destined to help the dark lord in his vision for where this world is to go while he is in command
1595477 all you have to do is flood anothers mind with the
1595478 i bleed all the time and no one gets hurt
1595479 why do you think that when you enter someones mind you pass out afterword
1595480 why do you think that this little gift of yours needs to be kept so secret
1595481 well others can use it against me i cant hurt anyone and i dont believe you you are just trying to scare me and it isnt going to work you low life piece of shit
1595482 take one of the mirrors you sleep with at night look into it and maybe youll see what a bloody prick but those words from her dry lips were enough for her captor to tighten one hand over her wrists and use the other to bring his wand to her throat
1595483 i might just slip and think a spell that you might not enjoy so much
1595484 now you will tell me right now what you know
1595485 there is no point in killing him if he doesnt know anymore than we do
1595486 we dont know and until we find out from him there is nothing more we can do unless we look for her ourselves

1595590 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
1595591 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
1595592 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
1595593 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
1595594 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
1595595 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
1595596 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
1595597 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
1595598 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
1595599 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
1595600 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing

1595606 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
1595607 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

1595613 the government in view of the rising inflationary pressure and the weight of steel in the wpi index is expected to ask the steel companies to keep the prices under check for some more time this move would put the margins of companies with low integration in raw materials like jsw steel under tremendous pressure in the short to medium term considering the raw material prices have shot up considerably

1595622 apollo tyres has tumbled almost 50 from the top due to obvious reasons high crude prices high rubber prices rubber prices has troubled over the last three years and crude has also gone up significantly so the margins were under pressure what one needs to keep in mind is the auto sales are slowing down the vehicle sales are slowing down but over the past six years the auto industry has done exceptionally well the vehicle population has more than doubled over the past six years so there is a strong replacement demand and normally one tends to replace truck tyres and passenger car tyres at about three and five year respectively so there is a strong replacement demand and thats precisely the reason why we saw the tyre industry reporting strong numbers almost 18 topline growth to about 23 kind of topline growth in case of apollo but apollo is the only player in the tyre industry which reported positive growth in the bottomline
1595623 mrf reported about 30 drop ceat was into losses jk tyre reported same profits as it reported in the first quarter of last year apollo reported 7 jump in the bottomline and based on these numbers and the fact that the crude and the rubber prices were at high and now have actually started softening we do expect apollo to report almost about rs 5 earnings so at about rs 32 downside is absolutely nil and the upside could be about 30 35 over the next 12 months we are looking at a price of rs 45 for apollo tyres over the next 12 18 months

1595627 the olympics are a place where you know you are going to reach more people than anywhere else
1595628 on some nights the olympics will draw more viewers than all the other networks combined
1595629 advertisers like that because it gives them an opportunity to meet some new potential customers
1595630 the ads are mostly high level corporate puffery that does nothing to mobilize consumers

1595647 we are extremely bullish on the tractor space this industry size is just about 3 25 lakh tractors that is what we sell every year in a country where there are 11 crore farmers the total tractor population is just about 40 45 lakh tractors so its like one tractor for every 25 farmers and i think the world average is 5 times that agri commodities are strong so the farmers are going to make a little more money we expect the government to increase the procurement prices over the next 6 12 24 months so we believe the farmer lob is going to be more prosperous thats the reason why we are extremely bullish on this industry
1595648 the second reason is the 100 construction subsidiary escort construction which is going to clock almost rs 40 crore of net profit for the current year and the management indicated that the company is going to get listed that construction company is equivalent to size of the listed entity and that is quoting at a marketcap of rs 700 crore the third point is the land at faridabad the management has clearly indicated and mentioned on one of the channels that they have about 100 acres of land at faridabad conservatively the value of that land should itself be about rs 1 000 crore
1595649 so about rs 1 000 crore of land about rs 700 crore of construction subsidy that works out to rs 1 700 crore and if one were to setup a plant like escorts with a capacity of 1 lakh tractors one needs at least minimum of rs 1 200 crore so rs 3 000 crore should be the marketcap enterprise value of escorts whereas today this company is quoting at an enterprise value of just about rs 1 300 crore so there is a substantial upside in escorts and i do expect it to touch the levels which it was quoting at in january a level of about rs 175 or so over the next 24 months
1595650 the main theme is the human element of forgiveness and someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1595651 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1595652 i feel it is a right of women to be able to give birth safely and when a woman is hiv positive the baby can obviously have the virus transmitted before being born

1595654 doctor yamada got divorced around mid june and after his divorce he came alone to claim the custody of the child
1595655 but according to indian laws a single father cannot adopt a girl child this is the major legal hassle arising in this case
1595656 but the question is when the child has 50 percent of its fathers dna where does the point arise of him having to adopt the child as he is her natural father
1595657 my son loves his daughter very much i shower all my love and affection on this baby tears keep rolling down my cheeks all the time

1595665 there is very little water in the system we are at historic low levels
1595666 there is not enough water in the system to do everything we want
1595667 there is not enough water in the system to bring down the sorts of quantities of water youd need to fill the lower lakes and to handle the evaporation in the lakes and transmission loss that is what youd lose along the way
1595668 even if we did make a decision to not give any allocations upstream there is insufficient water currently in storage less the critical human needs issue for us to viably manage the lower lakes with the amount of water that we have
1595669 that is extremely unfortunate and extremely difficult for the community down there
1595670 we have repeatedly said that were ready to have frank discussions with the state government at a moments notice and that offer stands
1595671 we are sitting patiently at the negotiating table waiting for the government to present a revised offer and hold genuine talks
1595672 we have also offered constructive compromises including asking the government to remove the contentious funding issue from the negotiations clearing the way for the enterprise bargaining process to move forward by focusing on the core issues of pay and conditions

1595677 it still grips me a year since the books publication

1595688 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1595689 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1595690 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1595691 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1595692 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1595693 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1595694 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1595695 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe

1595720 go ahead and pick out what you want ill be with you in a moment
1595721 i cant believe im doing this voluntarily whats wrong with me
1595722 nothing is wrong with you most people have a tattoo nowadays just relax and find a stitch if he has one
1595723 what if he doesnt what am i supposed to do get a flaming skull
1595724 skull panther bleeding heart cobra zombie who in the bloody hell would get a corpse tattooed on their body

1595731 whats the design you want me to put on your arm

1595733 oooooh god youre mother is gonna kill you and then shes gonna kill me
1595734 the tattoo is fine but youre mad as a hatter
1595735 keep this on for at least two hours and dont go swimming or soak in a hot tub for at least two weeks or the ink might fade dont bother the scab thatll form over it and try not to expose it to the sun for awhile because both of these things can also cause the tattoo to fade you need to keep it clean and you can put cocoa butter or lanolin on it to keep the skin moist along with using soap and warm water to keep it free from infection got it
1595736 well then congratulations on your first tattoo are both of you on the same bill
1595737 okay then you can have a seat over there or stand by him but its your turn now
1595738 because you love me and because youre doing something different from the doctor

1595740 until i get it through my head that i just let a strange tattooed man take a needle and put a disney character on my arm for the rest of this life
1595741 yeah well ill probably think its cute too after my arm quits hurtin like hell
1595742 come on ill take you anywhere you want to eat and thatll make you feel better about all this
1595743 because youve passed up a bunch of restaurants and i thought you might be angry at me for making you do this
1595744 if i didnt want to do it then i would have said no and put my foot down i did it for you and im not mad at you not in the least im just havent been thrilled with the restaurants weve passed i really dont wanna eat at mcdonalds or some fancy schmancy restaurant thats the only reason why ive been walking by them it has nothing to do with you so stop worrying alright i promise you if i get angry at you you will know it
1595745 in time i will like my stitch tattoo once i can see it that is but this was all for your benefit which is why i asked him to make it small enough to fit under my shirt sleeve and i hope to god the doctor doesnt come back here and see this because he will never let me live it down

1595777 it is interesting and i tend to agree in a perverse way that just about any application could be part of a uc experience once convergence is complete for all it services then the boundaries where a person communicates and where they are just using it systems will be hard to distinguish yet without clear definition of a label and what it applies to it is very hard for us to move a concept forward
1595778 my initial opinion is that the definition of uc should involve a key reference to presence which to me seems a key component of the uc
1595779 uc to the end user is about knowing who is available when and how and then having the tools easily available to reach them from within a unified interface and leveraging network and telephony infrastructures to utilize economies of scale to reduce costs
1595780 in a perverse way essentially every piece of equipment connected to the ip network is uc and any application running on those devices is uc
1595781 uc is a vision or philosophy that leads to solutions it is not a product
1595782 you cannot call a communications vendor and buy uc as a product no skus i know of
1595783 to be unified means the services are accessible not section 508 from any of the elements whatever the underlying technology used to support accessibility it is a set of services which make such interchanges work as demanded by the user

1595785 the greatest military genius our world ever produced was a brick layer from somewhere back of boston by the name of absalom jones everybody knows that if he had had a chance he would have shown the world some generalship that would have made all generalship before look like childs play and prentice work but he never got a chance

1595789 blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by the lord would be fulfilled
1595790 in her exultation mary prophetically declared in the name of the church my soul proclaims the glory of the lord and in fact marys hymn has spread far and wide and has become the prayer of the whole church in all ages

1595810 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1595811 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
1595812 yet somehow despite all this mccain remains in the game this is not easy to explain and it should cause a great deal of introspection at obama headquarters for all the many ways that the stars have aligned for obama he has yet to take full advantage of what historically has been a great opportunity

1595819 someone please convince me id be the happiest person in the world if i thought everyone was going to heaven but it doesnt seem to be the case i cant cope with hell the thought horrifies me and i almost lost my faith over it keep thinking surely if god is loving and powerful he could fix it for everyone it just seems so hard to have faith why would god make it so hard and uncertain if eternity hangs in the balance im just clinging to the possibility that god will do something as people die or maybe even in between death and the last day
1595820 in the long run the answer to all those who object to the doctrine of hell is itself a question what are you asking god to do to wipe out their past sins and at all costs to give them a fresh start smoothing every difficult and offering every miraculous help but he has done so on calvary to forgive them they will not be forgiven to leave them alone alas i am afraid that is what he does

1595946 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience

1595951 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation

1596027 if it was suicide what made these four children do it
1596028 there must have been something going on to make four apparently happy and healthy people do that
1596029 but i wouldnt dream of telling you what they are ive looked at all the available evidence in the way that nicholas blake did in his review my ideas hold no more water than his in my opinion unless you were standing there when it happened you dont know
1596030 the play is focusing on the parents quest for justice rather than speculating on what happened
1596031 they know their own children they were such happy go lucky boys and suicide wasnt in keeping with the way their lives were going they are adamant their children didnt commit suicide so it follows that someone else killed them
1596032 it was subdued after the first two deaths but it rose again in 2001 and 2002 when you have a similar situation mysterious deaths and more to the point no investigation that shows the culture in the camp is at the core of this
1596033 it is an appalling wrong in a civilised society that four kids can die and we can allow our government to dance around justice in the way that they have i dont think its something i can walk away from
1596034 its a great feeling and we are looking forward to seeing him play

1596075 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer
1596076 while british attitudes are more egalitarian than in the 1980s there are signs that support for gender equality may have hit a high point some time during the 1990s
1596077 when it comes to the clash between work and family life doubts about whether a woman should be doing both are starting to creep in
1596078 attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed
1596079 women still shoulder the bulk of caring and housework at home the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities the result motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are straitjacketed by gender stereotypes
1596080 many mothers tell us that in the first year of a babys life they want to stay at home but often feel they have to return to work too early because of financial constraints we need to do more to help mothers and fathers by increasing well paid parental leave and changing how it can be shared between them
1596081 the results are even more extreme in the us where the percentage of people arguing that family life does not suffer if a woman works has plummeted from 51 in 1994 to 38 in 2002
1596082 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1596083 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
1596084 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
1596085 in britain and the us however where support for equal opportunities for both sexes is much longer standing some people are now starting to have second thoughts
1596086 in most cases this appears to revolve around concerns that the welfare of children and of the family are being compromised the more women spend their time at work and find themselves lumbered with the double burden of employment and family care
1596087 we are still educating to confirm a gender role division that people thought was eradicated 25 years ago
1596088 at the moment in the uk we are heading in the wrong direction after a period when there was greater support at an ideological level for an equal division of labour
1596089 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
1596090 by making all roles flexible at every level ending the long working hours culture and challenging discriminatory attitudes women and men could participate in the workplace on an equal footing and live free from stereotypes about whose role it is to do the caring
1596091 when this happens business the economy and society as a whole will all reap the benefits
1596092 the british economy cannot afford not to have women in the workforce women make up 45 of employees in an age when we have significant skill shortages we cannot miss out on any part of the talent pool
1596093 our latest research shows 79 of organisations are struggling to recruit and 75 are struggling to retain skills they have to think how to address the need for more flexibility for women and men
1596094 a family does not suffer if a woman is in full time employment
1596095 it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children
1596096 our business plan consists of a dual platform multi technology service that exploits the full range of convergent technologies including ip and will offer consumers a competitively priced spectrum of entertainment and interactive services through a single service provider
1596097 we look forward to providing inspiring dynamic and refreshingly different programming for our subscribers
1596098 the goal for our next project is something very different

1596102 we received an initial report from the scene that the air force helicopter crashed and that all six officers on board were killed
1596103 its like the practice in chinese tradition of having all parts of the world come to pay tribute
1596104 the olympics also lets your own people know that the rest of the world confers legitimacy on and supports the government
1596105 knowing that the chinese would take stock of those decisions very few statesmen could avoid showing up
1596106 the chinese leadership has signaled that coming earns points for the countries concerned
1596107 we feel better at least there is someone around that you can trust and knows how to help you
1596108 if you look around and see the soldiers you automatically feel safer
1596109 i believe we are on the right track to guarantee more safety for citizens to give them the feeling that the state is there and it is serious about fighting crime
1596110 the soldiers make you feel safer but its sad that we need them
1596111 i think it is a good measure as long as it is temporary
1596112 if it lasted longer it would give me a sense of militarization
1596113 no one is afraid of the military but to use them in cities is a media move to cover up the cuts to security forces
1596114 our soldiers are highly professional but they are not trained to maintain public order
1596115 completed their investigation into a criminal sex case involving intercourse against the laws of nature

1596121 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1596122 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1596123 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1596124 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1596125 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1596126 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1596127 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1596128 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1596129 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1596130 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1596131 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1596132 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1596133 a close race down to the wire only one winner thanks i accept
1596134 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1596135 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place

1596153 we have a competitive advantage with a site that is at the confluence of these two roadways
1596154 i think a lot of the homeowners realize this is a good site and probably will be developed but i would just like a little bit of protection
1596155 giving a developer basically unlimited freedom to put nearly anything he wants on the property doesnt seem fair and it doesnt seem good for the community

1596167 offer a glimpse of the ripe market opportunity for linux based desktops to proliferate

1596169 the last time we took stock there were some 650 captives operating in india
1596170 from plain and simple cost arbitrage india is today offering tremendous value arbitrage
1596171 low cost does not mean low technology simple low cost solutions often require very complex technology
1596172 we often underestimate the innovative prowess of the domestic players and have so far been looking for technological innovations from the west
1596173 with the launch of innovative products like tata nano and hcl mileap an ultra portable laptop that perception is slowly but surely changing
1596174 the hcl labs serve as hubs of technological innovation and the design centres of future hcl products and solutions
1596175 india is emerging as an r amp d powerhouse its not that india is doing only simple coding work for the global products indian captives are today a major source of innovations
1596176 india has a very strong domestic market that is increasingly getting more prosperous unlike other economies india is not dependent only on exports
1596177 the solutions for india are very different from the solutions multinationals undertake for the developed world
1596178 these business pcs have a high performance machine that has the ability to withstand harsh indian working conditions and delivers productivity and efficiency consistently with a small form factor these desktops are ideal for organisations that struggle with challenges such as space limitations data security and power consumption especially in the ites it enabled services sector

1596182 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine the wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1596183 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1596184 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1596185 we are contacting the u s embassy to see what they know about it
1596186 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options

1596197 doctor yamada got divorced around mid june and after his divorce he came alone to claim the custody of the child
1596198 but according to indian laws a single father cannot adopt a girl child this is the major legal hassle arising in this case
1596199 but the question is when the child has 50 percent of its fathers dna where does the point arise of him having to adopt the child as he is her natural father
1596200 my son loves his daughter very much i shower all my love and affection on this baby tears keep rolling down my cheeks all the time
1596201 the grandmother becomes very emotional when she is told that the child cannot be taken out of india the lawmakers will have to find some solution for this

1596223 photorealistic is what live action movies are animation is an art its like and i uh this is an art philosophical discussion you either like photorealistic art that looks exactly like a photograph or you like something that actually tries to find the truth behind the realism to me animation is an art its all about design its all about style its not about making it look photo real photo real ive been making photo real movies all my life and they have a lot of animation in them but theyre still photo real thats not what animation is animation is something else entirely its a completely different medium
1596224 art is a technological medium all art is so a lot of it has to do with engineering and trying to figure out how to create what you imagine its also a medium that is dictated primarily by the amount of resources you have available to you if youre pharaoh you can build pyramids if youre a shaman you really only have a few pieces of chalk and the wall of a cave and you have to work within that
1596225 it used to be animation you had actors play the parts the secret is that a lot of people especially in television animation didnt hire really great actors and even in features they didnt so the idea of hiring a really good actor you know a tom hanks to play something was a really revolutionary idea it was mostly jeff katzenberg who said we need really top actors well there are a lot of top actors that arent movie stars partly they did it because they were great actors partly they did it because they wanted to use it for publicity so they could sit up here and talk to you and to be very honest with you i dont really think i need to hire an actor a big movie star to go and publicize my movie if the movie works and you like it you love it thats fine but i dont need angelina jolie here to have you guys come and say im only going to the press conference because angelina jolie is going to be there and i want to get her autograph thats what it comes down to thats what they do they have 2 days in a studio or 3 days in a studio and then they have like 2 weeks doing press so theyre mainly paid for the press theyre not really paid for the movie im sure im going to hear from jeff about that

1596237 but is anyone really willing to make the argument that quality can only be bought at a high price
1596238 if alienware overdrive pc hypersonic and voodoo were taking in such great margins then why have they all opted to integrate with other companies you referenced hps marketing prowess as a reason for voodoos decision but if the margins were there then they obviously wouldnt need hp especially when merging with hp would bring their own quality into question
1596239 one thing we do both agree on an overpriced gaming pc isnt right for me i dont go to the extreme of arguing that by offering a more reasonalbly priced gaming rig voodoo will be competing with hp no serious gamer would argue that hp makes a worthy gaming rig this is probably one reason for buying voodoo
1596240 you still seem to be relying on the argument that quality can be bought only at a high price and that a high price guarantees quality you also dont seem to be taking into account the changes taking place in the pc gaming market if the decision to buid and upgrade streets and highways were dependent soley on luxury car owners we wouldnt have very many streets or highways
1596241 hes a rookie but gosh hes had a lot of carries his whole career
1596242 as a running back hes a veteran it will be new for him playing against an nfl defense particularly that the patriots defense and it will be interesting to see how hell do
1596243 but id be surprised if hes not up to the task
1596244 he came out here and worked hard and took a ton of reps hes got a good feel for the offense i think were pleased with where hes at right now
1596245 punt returns are a little hard but kickoff returns are natural i always wanted to do that at rutgers

1596248 its just great to see his face the guys are kind of relieved and excited to have him back
1596249 i expect not to know what to expect and how its going to be like you talk about rookies and how theyre going to respond im interested in how im going to respond
1596250 i cant look at it that way i just go out there and play football i cant put so much pressure on myself to say i have to be perfect on every play i hope i am but if something goes wrong its not the end of the world

1596271 how i play in these games is going to determine who is going to be the starter
1596272 every one of these games is extremely important you get very limited reps so you got to take advantage of every rep that you have and every throw you have you got to do everything you can to win that job
1596273 i cant put so much pressure on myself that i need to be perfect every play
1596274 i hope i am but if something goes wrong its not the end of the world ive got to go out and do what i know i am capable of doing
1596275 i feel like each day gets a little bit easier my main thing is that the things i learn in each practice im not going to be perfect there are going to be balls that i throw that maybe i dont want to throw there but as long as i can correct them after practice then ill be going in the right direction

1596282 the story on the first asian americans who moved here to build the transcontinental railroad and moved the waters in this delta to grow chinese pears in courtland and help california feed the world

1596303 the biggest pair of policy bums the country has ever had
1596304 not made one valuable structural change in the 12 years he was treasurer
1596305 hes a guy without imagination and he is a guy without courage that point was proven by the fact he let former prime minister howard stay there for so long
1596306 its a liberal party so bereft of talent that they have to go to such a low grade performer as costello to come back as their leader
1596307 in national terms to have such a nong and he is in policy terms he is a mouse to have him back again speaks volumes about the liberal party
1596308 in labor party terms i sort of hope he does as he makes it a better pitch for us
1596309 peter costello stated his intentions at the end of last year and if he seeks to change those intentions hes entitled to do so but he can do so in his own time
1596310 as far as im aware his intentions are precisely as he stated them at the end of last year
1596311 it is impossible now to look after the baby boomers impossible
1596312 it was the labor government of australia that broke the back of inflation in the recession in the early 90s
1596313 in 1993 there was no risk to inflation at all but the bank gun shy shoved on the brakes and only released them after the howard government had been elected
1596314 this gave not the keating government the reward it was entitled to but howard and costello the biggest pair of policy bums the country has ever had
1596315 not made one valuable structural change in the 12 years he was treasurer

1596319 over the past five years the apparel industry has experienced remarkable changes generating challenges from intense competition to pricing pressures to season and line complexity to time to market
1596320 as a result apparel brands retailers and suppliers need a system to streamline their communication and make sure everyone is on the same page which ultimately benefits the overall business were proud to partner with global apparel industry leader zymmetry group to deliver the very first solution to address these demands by approaching product development and sourcing as a unified business process

1596322 industry consolidation the emergence of private equity the high cost of failure the reduction in operating margins and the substantial working capital required have all created demands that require the industry to force its way to a streamlined level of efficiency
1596323 if the garment industry or a brand organize themselves and concentrate religiously on creating and maintaining an efficient supply chain on specialization and on collaboration there is no doubt that profit and success will soon follow
1596324 based on my experience the franchise partner program has been a very effective channel program
1596325 its a win win relationship where dre helps cdc software expand in a new market while the company provides us the resources we need to grow and prosper
1596326 the franchise partner program has benefited isl in multiple ways such as having access to cdc softwares portfolio of innovative and award winning products such as platinum hrm and ross enterprise which complement our product line as well as the opportunity to leverage their global distribution network to resell our own products
1596327 the franchise partner program has become a key sales channel for our solutions globally and it is highly differentiated relative to the overall software industry
1596328 it is a low cost investment that bolsters our international distribution strategy especially in emerging markets we are looking at other opportunities to expand the franchise partner program including eastern europe as well as russia and other high growth emerging markets

1596333 i have been meeting chinese leaders for 7 1 2 years and my message has been the same you should not fear religious people in your society
1596334 as a matter of fact religious people will make your society a better place
1596335 ought to welcome people being able to express their minds and to the extent that people arent able to do that and people arent able to worship freely it is a mistake
1596336 but its also an opportunity to say to the chinese people we respect your traditions we respect your history
1596337 im concerned about north koreas human rights record im concerned about its uranium enrichment activities as well as its nuclear testing and proliferation and its ballistic missile programmes
1596338 the best way to appoach and answer the concerns is strong verification measures thats where we are in the six party talks
1596339 they have got to show a verification regime that we can trust
1596340 you can verifiably do what you say youre going to do or you continue to be the most sanctioned regime in the world
1596341 more clearly demonstrates the contrast between free and open societies and repressive closed societies than the korean peninsula
1596342 takes its rightful place on the world stage north korea traps its people in misery and isolation
1596343 the police have completed their investigations into the allegations of sexual misconduct involving anwar ibrahim according to the principles and the procedures of law within the countrys legal system
1596344 under malaysian laws you are only guilty when you are convicted otherwise being charged does not make you a convict or a guilty person
1596345 this is probably an attempt by the authorities to affect the election result but i hope they will be wrong that this will backfire
1596346 barring any unforeseen situation emerging in the next couple of weeks i dont think we are in for any surprise hes going to win the election by a handsome margin
1596347 the key thing will be the margin by which he wins and whether its bigger than his wifes margin as a barometer of how opposition support has improved or not since march
1596348 the government has been telling us that it was wrong for anwars wife to resign so soon after the general elections
1596349 however it is a non issue as far as i am concerned anwar is a capable leader who should be in parliament to fight for our rights

1596356 the situation will only be remedied by cuts to official interest rates however we are likely to need to see numerous cuts to get the banks to materially reduce lending rates in the current credit constrained environment
1596357 the poet in the act of constructing the balah poem constitutes himself as a tribesman capable of containing violence in the symbolic game of honor
1596358 rule over those who cherish their autonomy demands the art of persuasion not coercion for each person must be made to believe that he is a free agent
1596359 power persuasion and language a critique of the segmentary model in the middle east
1596360 cultural conventions of art are grounded in real world everyday practical activities of the society in which that art is produced
1596361 yemeni tribesmen think that poetry is too precious not to use for pressing public issues and that it can have a transformative effect on them as well hence it possesses considerable power
1596362 the two kinds of practices artistic and social are indissoluble to fashion a poem is to engage in social practice
1596363 khawlani tribes tried to avoid exercising a kind of deadly brute force in which blood was spilled and men were killed rather they applied symbolic force or a poetic representation of the real thing whose aim was to achieve honor and not necessarily the liquidation of the opponent

1596366 thats what i want to do help the team to win
1596367 hes one of the big stars in the game more than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he breeds success with charisma and character hes a huge part of what we are
1596368 if you look at the numbers in the course of a year they really jump after a day off and we have to continue to do that especially in this warm weather
1596369 when i went out to talk to him it was the first time he told me that he had had enough
1596370 thats something i have to get used to the heat and humidity and running the bases
1596371 i guess i have to learn when to run and when not to i did lose a little bit of strength in my legs but i have to make pitches no matter what
1596372 if we dont pitch well i dont care how many ken griffey jrs we can bring to the ballclub we got to start pitching well and getting people out then this ballclub will be fine
1596373 here this worked for me and itll give you a nice quality without creating enormous files

1596377 ive never even met him i just dont like his work
1596378 its a kind of deliberate ugliness which has been exploited as a gimmick this isnt a personal preference its a judgment
1596379 im very surprised its caused an upheaval in some camps
1596380 i didnt specifically hone in on this prize i just happened to have a work which i thought i should enter into this exhibition
1596381 i can no longer afford my loan since the interest rate reset to 28 or as you like to say in sanskrit navavi nshati percent

1596384 we received an initial report from the scene that the air force helicopter crashed and that all six officers on board were killed
1596385 right now theyre trying to figure out why his body rejects transfusions
1596386 i think thats the next step theyre to figure out theyre also trying to figure out if his sister is a bone marrow match so im just kind of taking it day by day
1596387 its nice to be able to talk to him about four days during his treatment i couldnt speak to him he had real bad side effects it feels good to be able to talk to him on the phone and hear his voice and hear him a little peppier than he was a few weeks ago
1596388 we have already recalled the product and we dont produce it anymore
1596389 to lower trade barriers decrease trade distorting subsidies and stabilize an affordable food supply for all nations
1596390 reasonable reforms to our crop insurance program and our system of countercyclical and direct aid payments
1596391 i cant do the team much good unless i get healthy weve been trying to treat it for the last couple of days and it hasnt worked
1596392 we had a chance to use him in a less pressure situation but he wasnt effective
1596393 this is the best thing for his peace of mind
1596394 we always ask our children when anyone and everyone is coming to visit because it is their home the only home they have and they heartily agreed
1596395 the children see him as a kind uncle coming to visit not in his official position
1596396 there are geniuses poets artists and physicians among the kids who call mercy their home and yet they are labeled as klong toey children and not the children who are worthy of proper education and jobs
1596397 the visit of mr uncle president is telling them they are of great value and not to believe any of the bad stuff people might say
1596398 yes things are tough here in thailand the streets and slums are rough we have been beaten up used and abused but today is fine and tomorrow is going to be even better and today we are going to have as much fun as we possibly can
1596399 i dont support agricultural subsidies no matter where they are
1596400 the farm bill 300 billion is something america simply cant afford
1596401 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1596402 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1596403 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1596404 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1596405 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1596406 were employing close to 2 000 people right now in iowa in the wind energy industry
1596407 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1596408 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1596409 president bush and i just had a good conversation about how critically important ethanol is and how iowa is positioned so well to lead the nation
1596410 i have no idea why john mccain doesnt support it it hurts him in indiana and missouri and ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1596411 iowa minnesota wisconsin and perhaps indiana are very important states mccain is behind and hes in danger of falling further behind
1596412 its like the practice in chinese tradition of having all parts of the world come to pay tribute
1596413 the olympics also lets your own people know that the rest of the world confers legitimacy on and supports the government
1596414 knowing that the chinese would take stock of those decisions very few statesmen could avoid showing up
1596415 the chinese leadership has signaled that coming earns points for the countries concerned

1596418 each of the idents feature a single piece of action and each of the logos react in a different way depending on their behavioural elements

1596430 if you the automated lamp is off turn on if not do nothing
1596431 its to further the mission that we want to see all of our students succeed
1596432 some are bored or they dont like the environment and some have been pressured to go out and work
1596433 let us help you find a way to get your education
1596434 the shoes we collect will be sent to an organization that recycles the shoes and sends them to third world countries that need them
1596435 we get paid by the pound for the shoes and all of those funds will go to our scholarship
1596436 we wont take flip flops bedroom slippers and shoes with holes mens shoes and sneakers weigh the most but we will take all lightly used shoes

1596445 they took a chance on me and ill be eternally grateful
1596446 youve got to manage the to do list dont just stick it in your pocket and forget about it
1596447 my goal with all of this is to show where we are what we have accomplished and what we have left to do
1596448 we had to get everything organized because it would become kind of a mess if we didnt have a structure
1596449 for the vast majority of them its a decision for the police chief to determine how he uses the resources under his control
1596450 this difficult decision comes as a direct result of the ongoing crisis in the housing and financial industries
1596451 the management would like to express our sincere thanks to our dedicated employees our vendors and the thousands who have trusted our company to build their homes in the triad
1596452 certainly sales are not what they were 18 months ago to 2 years ago
1596453 in most cases a builder borrows a certain percentage of the construction of the house including the land value
1596454 theyre anticipating a turnaround on the sale of that property within six months of the completion of the property
1596455 unfortunately it was a bit of a trend where builders were still building at the same pace and purchasers were not purchasing at the same rate
1596456 some of it is just plain economics that occur when you have builders that are building a lot of houses they have more on the line with the banks and banks have been a little less friendly with everybody
1596457 guys are selling drugs in broad daylight and you are afraid to walk out the door
1596458 the children cant get in to use the parks because of drug activity
1596459 our neighborhood organization is trying to put an end to all of the crime but its hard to keep up
1596460 its showing us in a different perspective than when we are going around arresting people
1596461 it gives people a chance to talk to us and for us to give them a better insight into what we do
1596462 we are hoping that the free food will bring people out to have some fun
1596463 ive met a lot of folks for the first time today
1596464 were here to educate kids on fire safety and prevention
1596465 our main objective is to let the kids and adults know about what services we provide while having a good time and creating fellowship he said
1596466 we hope we only have to come here to events like this instead of in times of need
1596467 a lot of the benefits are state required and it would be hard to put a figure on them
1596468 when youre negotiating a contract with a lawyer its always amusing
1596469 lawyers read things differently because of their training every word gets scrutinized but it didnt take us too long to come up with something acceptable to both sides
1596470 the board feels good about this mo feels good about this
1596471 partly its how good are they at following through with whatever approach they take
1596472 we were told by the consultant that we werent overstaffed at all
1596473 its determining what the priorities are and its what the community says the priorities are
1596474 if a government is impatient and they want really big savings really quickly thats tough
1596475 they can just slash costs but in all likelihood that will have a damaging effect
1596476 we would like to get everybodys input and incorporate that into the plans
1596477 im not opposed to it but its a mighty big complex to put in without municipal water and sewer
1596478 these are the standard things that we know were going to have to deal with and thats why we have these meetings
1596479 one thing we bring to the market is a sense of community involvement
1596480 if they come back to ask for rezoning then we will have a town open house then the planning board will have a public hearing and so would the council
1596481 i think its important for our students and our community to realize that whether youre for the war in iraq or against it you realize that these are our brothers and sisters that are giving their lives
1596482 we are honored to partner with the local high school to assist in remembering these brave men and women
1596483 the natural landscape and miles of sidewalk at mackintosh make the community the ideal place to hold a benefit run of this magnitude
1596484 the komen foundation sends you a training schedule that you do before the walk to prepare
1596485 you are supposed to walk so many miles four days and cross train one day and get two days off
1596486 my friends and i called ourselves the laker girls because we traveled to smith mountain lake where lynn had a house and wed all hang out
1596487 when i found out i had to walk 60 miles i was worried sure i do exercise and i was in the army for 23 years but that is a lot of walking
1596488 i was so happy i was able to help someone i donated 20 million stem cells after coming back from the trip
1596489 over the three days you laugh you cry and you make some new friends
1596490 last year there were 2 800 walkers we all slept in two person pink tents it was an incredible sight as you looked out and saw 1 400 pink tents
1596491 chris was diagnosed seven years ago and had a mastectomy on her left breast then she had a recurrence and had to have a mastectomy on the right side
1596492 i wrote a poem titled may you have and each line of the poem will be represented on each of the tents
1596493 our fuel costs have gone from being 14 percent of our costs to 24 percent
1596494 but ladies and gentlemen thats about like putting a band aid on an open wound
1596495 i think mr mccain has a more comprehensive solution to this problem than we got from mr obama
1596496 it scared me a little bit i didnt know exactly what was going on
1596497 but its nothing to worry about ill be back out there soon
1596498 i think this camp has gone better than every other
1596499 usually the scrimmage is a little bit uglier than it was this year
1596500 you definitely got to make sure youve got your fluids in
1596501 if they use money to import the bottles they have less for the medication
1596502 we help others in other countries simply by saving medicine bottles
1596503 share laugh play take risks and find our individual and collective voices
1596504 there be a bounty of grapes out of our very own vineyaaarrrd
1596505 there bein such small amounts they chambourcin aglianico carmine tannat merlot zinfandel and syrah were picked and processed together
1596506 when the bobcats hired him it showed me they were committed to making the franchise better
1596507 hiring larry brown an elite coach you have to take notice of that
1596508 larry brown he brings a certain dynamic and insight to the game that would make most teams better
1596509 i think hes a perfect fit for us our team is young we are hard working and he can give us that discipline and those little insights to the game that will take us to the next level
1596510 and its all thanks to the community groups individuals and businesses of guilford county
1596511 the amount of schools that we can realistically serve really depends on the community
1596512 thats a really great way a company could do some team building
1596513 teachers at every school need support when it comes to purchasing those items
1596514 youve got to go back a lot of years to see them being this aggressive
1596515 we are very much tuned into whats going on in high school football in the state of north carolina
1596516 you havent seen a group at duke thats working it this way in a long time
1596517 because of his familiarity with the state of georgia they probably hit georgia harder than they did the state of north carolina
1596518 he and coach norwood have known each other for a long time
1596519 if coach norwood tells me something im probably going to do it
1596520 one of the big things is that hes got a plan
1596521 hes been through it before if you havent been a head coach before there are going to be some things happening that youre just not prepared for
1596522 obviously that speaks volumes especially to quarterbacks and offensive players
1596523 everybody wants an opportunity to play for this coaching staff
1596524 i think overall in the state a lot of high school coaches believe that if duke can ever turn it around coach cutcliffe and his staff will do it
1596525 section 377c of the penal code for alleged carnal intercourse against the order of nature
1596526 with some other forms of mental illnesses you can make the argument that it could be for the better but not for depression
1596527 unlike other forms of mental illness depression is usually a state within which people withdraw from usual activities physically and emotionally they may not be as vested or as interested in the sport
1596528 better understand that what you see on the outside is not always whats going on in the inside
1596529 we all have bad days that doesnt mean a person has depression were looking at what has happened over a period of time to make that diagnosis
1596530 the lord put me on that corner for a reason
1596531 is that he is a player we like a lot
1596532 there are a couple of clubs who have approached us asking for uche but betis has not called
1596533 it is all very exciting for me especially since part of my family is spanish the move was completed on sunday night and i celebrated it with my wife and a bottle of champagne
1596534 it is a dream for me and my entire family
1596535 two weeks after the euros real madrid told soren lerby his representative that they were very interested the leaders of hamburg told me that i could leave next season but left the door open for before then and this has happened
1596536 the ideal position for me is behind the front two but also i can play on the left or right there are several options
1596537 a mild mood elevator and a mild anti anxiety drug with no dependence side effects
1596538 never respond to the reporter who promises you the chance to give your side of the story that means kiss me because i am going to rape you anyway
1596539 it really is a problem and im doing my best to give up drugs
1596540 this is a disgraceful decision and defies common sense there was clearly no intention on the part of the teacher to deliberately insult the islamic faith
1596541 we call upon the sudanese president omar al bashir to intervene in this case without delay to ensure that ms gibbons is freed from this quite shameful ordeal
1596542 i think what we shot for the cover was really very interesting especially where we used sheets and all and its just that there is a great sensuality to it i always think that minimal make up and no fuss hair takes away from everything and its all about the eyes
1596543 she has been in the industry for a while now she is very confident about her own self lot has been said about her dressing and all that but she is very aware about herself now and its a new vidya and its great to be a part of that new state she is in
1596544 nigerians are fighting corruption through which many of our leaders mostly men have stolen fortunes for their personal use they build colossal homes in london rome and new york because they have to spend money on women and have to hide them in these big homes
1596545 they are being misled every time by a naked woman
1596546 the police will have to carry tape measures around how will a policeman know that my dress is two inches below my neck if he doesnt touch me ill slap him
1596547 the bottom line is the little people are the ones who are going to be hurt
1596548 when this effort is complete 150 000 folks will have received a benefit from this program
1596549 its not a lack of projects or interest from the communities the need is here
1596550 this is one of the key elements of improving the health standards
1596551 all these waters are going to come and well be battling
1596552 our latest data shows that the number of hot spots on kalimantan island has nearly doubled
1596553 i dont know how it has happened so far the tests that took place hasnt shown any indications politics has been played with me so far four tests have taken place the results of these four tests havent come out yet a player will never commit such mistakes
1596554 which is the test that the officials are quoting four tests were conducted and the results of the last two tests are not yet out
1596555 i requested officials to send me to beijing and get the doping test done there shoot me if the result of beijing test is positive the procedures followed by the lab is irregular not only in my case but in other peoples case as well
1596556 there are all chances that samples could have been changed or samples could have been polluted as well we had informed the government in writing about the inability of the lab to conduct proper test
1596557 if she would have been allowed to come here it would have been a matter of shame for the entire contingent so it is good that she was not allowed to come here
1596558 the sentence is a mockery of justice and we consider gillian to be a prisoner of conscience
1596559 why are they assuming that the teddy bear was named after our prophet this is really stupid
1596560 unbelievable and totally outrageous more excellent pr for islam and the forward thinking rational muslim community
1596561 it is tokenism by the sudanese government if they had really felt she had insulted islam they would have sentenced her to much longer it seems they are scoring points
1596562 our government dithered over intervening and this is what happens we should have been a lot tougher a lot sooner

1596567 they made some adjustments to the things we were trying to do and they made them earlier than we had hoped they would
1596568 i know seven errors are a lot but it wasnt as though we totally gave them the game they took it
1596569 the last two weeks of the season winslow stepped in and did a very nice job
1596570 its been filled with some adversity and many opportunities for our kids and our team to say aww the heck with it its too tough
1596571 im very happy with the growth that we made and our perseverence
1596572 we ran into a very very solid billings scarlet team
1596573 it wasnt anything we werent trying to do it was just a matter of them being a solid team that we just couldnt beat
1596574 i have great hope this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship
1596575 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and took her
1596576 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of
1596577 these concoctions just show how the americans will stop at nothing to subvert justice
1596578 they say that she is an al qaeda supporter and that shes very dangerous yet shes left alone in a room with a weapon this is pure fantasy
1596579 this woman stayed there until she lost her mind until she became insane hitting the door and screaming day and night
1596580 in practice its next to impossible to get it done in canada
1596581 what places my health at greatest risk is the lack of a well functioning liver
1596582 its true that organs for transplant are in short supply but nonetheless those with hiv hep c or b can be equally good candidates
1596583 the cabin is a confined space and we have to be respectful of everybody
1596584 prohibit the use of a portable electronic device onboard an aircraft where the device may impair the functioning of the aircraft systems or equipment the regulations are for the safety of the aircraft and passengers due to the potential for interference
1596585 the technology has moved on from there especially if youre using a specialized frequency
1596586 the reason for the ban on cellphones is basically annoyance
1596587 the airlines have been in a bit of a tailspin over the last couple of years and have only now got around to fitting the equipment
1596588 so most of the equipment that we have sold really since the business took off in 2001 has been into military government and high end corporate aircrafts
1596589 obviously because theyre describing a black shoe this does not match with any of the running shoes that we have found so far
1596590 i dont rule that out being part of the ones they found in canada
1596591 once it hits the straits of juan de fuca and it had an outgoing tide if it was carrying it out to the open water and it hit a strong west wind it could kick it out
1596592 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry
1596593 the continuing strength in the retail businesses in the developing markets
1596594 if there ever was a time that a precariously close to inhumane work environment could go over the edge this new production ramp would be it
1596595 go to china steve look firsthand at just how apple products are manufactured well happily go along and vow to never raise the subject again if everything checks out
1596596 these results show consumers hungry for all varieties of blackberry
1596597 it appears like when it comes to the blackberry the adage if you build it they will come certainly holds true
1596598 the real losers in this smart phone battle will most likely be the second tier players who could find themselves increasingly pushed to the sidelines as the two goliaths battle for market dominance
1596599 we expect apple will consolidate its lead in the retail music market as cd sales continue to slow
1596600 amazons cd buyers tend to be older so they havent abandoned the cd format to the extent seen in the average music buyer plus amazons successful introduction of its digital download store will help the company improve its position in the future
1596601 in al doilea trimestru din 2008 am inregistrat din nou rezultate pozitive semnificativ imbunatatite fata de aceeasi perioada a anului trecut datorita performantelor operationale si favorizate de preturile ridicate la titei am facut investitii cu 74 mai mari fata de perioada similara din 2007 am mentinut productia de titei la nivelul la care a fost stabilizata in cursul anului trecut am crescut eficienta pe segmentul de rafinare si avem o crestere considerabila la vanzarile de produse petroliere
1596602 more than half of our customers are outside the united states so weve committed to making vuescan work with 95 of the languages that our customers speak we work with many of the major scanner manufacturers and theyve all requested that we support multiple languages
1596603 vuescan is very popular in germany and france and i am confident that native editions will have a big impact on these markets combined with support for more than 750 scanners and multi core processor support we are very excited about our future development
1596604 since thefind was launched in november 2006 weve continually improved our ability to help consumers as the leading shopping search engine for lifestyle goods known for our comprehensive search capabilities to find and purchase products in local neighborhoods
1596605 the key design point of our iphone application was to blur the lines between the desktop and the mobile phone creating a rich shopping experience for consumers with comprehensive information available at anytime from any location
1596606 the iphones location awareness faster downloads lower price and easy access to applications finally create mainstream appeal for mobile local search
1596607 as these new standards permeate the market a consumer use case will quickly grow around finding things to do and buy locally this will be especially resonant in the area of local shopping and finding out exactly what stores have what promotions and what products on the shelf right now
1596608 marketing got wind of it and nobody at apple is ever allowed to speak publicly about anything without marketing approval
1596609 while we believe apple is working on a lower end iphone form factor we do not think one will come until spring 2009
1596610 web developers all over the world are designing rich iphone ready websites
1596611 with freeway 5 2 its easy to create beautiful sites that take advantage of the iphones great features and since its freeway you know the code will be efficient and standards compliant
1596612 acum 3 4 ani o concesiune se amortiza in 4 5 ani acum se amortizeaza in 10 12 ani de ce au crescut foarte mult valoarea terenului manopera pretul materialelor in plus la un volum de 20 000 de masini vandute pe an trebuie sa ai in stoc la dealeri sau in vama in permanenta cam 4 000 5 000 de masini
1596613 we will be individuals as time goes on because i can talk to the other people and get to know them and not just rely on rex
1596614 im my own person and i dont want to be known as rexs girlfriend
1596615 look if you dont fix this youre not going to be here
1596616 he let me know where i stand and i performed and look at me now
1596617 he is as talented a fullback as ive ever had
1596618 the only thing that prevents him from being very very successful every play is leonard
1596619 hes strong enough hes fast enough he has great skill
1596620 it wasnt happening so i think in fairness to a player as you get down to that final roster cut you better let him know where he stands and so if he chooses to do something about it he can
1596621 its one of those things where a guy gave his all to this game and stuff
1596622 for it to end like that its sad but you know in that situation you have to do whats right for you and your family i think he made the right decision
1596623 i cant explain the feeling yet i think im still trying to get it
1596624 we didnt know what to expect but they definitely worked hard since spring
1596625 we took classes together worked out together had team barbecues all summer
1596626 this is by far the closest team weve had since ive been here
1596627 i want to prove to everybody what i can do and show people im not just a backup my goal is to become a better leader every day and get this team to a bowl game
1596628 naturally if youre a competitor you should have a chip on your shoulder were going to find out if our chip is big enough
1596629 its just great to be back out here with these guys and finally feel like part of the team again
1596630 that was not my intent when i started the meeting
1596631 my whole intent was was he coming into the locker room to play for the green bay packers and where is your mind at that was the first question i asked him and we could never get back to that point where he was comfortable
1596632 he told me that was not the case and i respect that i told him over and over again i would like to be wrong but i never thought through this whole process that he was going to play this year
1596633 those are the words that were used when we concluded
1596634 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1596635 stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true
1596636 whatever way i can contribute whatever way i can help im more than willing to do
1596637 when i came back here i was still going through the whole freshman adjustment
1596638 the problem was i was trying to do everything at once like i was used to doing in high school
1596639 i had started a mission and i intended to finish it
1596640 it was like id rather be catching footballs than tearing down drywall or ripping up carpet
1596641 he kept battling and kept doing the things to put himself back to being a member of this team because its something he very desperately wanted to do
1596642 and we held the door open for him to do that and tried to work with him so it could happen
1596643 hes a big kid listed at 6 feet 220 pounds and hes physical
1596644 hell put his face on you in the running game and he could really help on special teams
1596645 there were times you feel down about it like is this going to happen
1596646 but coach willingham looked at me and looked at how ive grown and looked in there and saw that there was something there that could help contribute to the success of this team
1596647 i was surprised after we won that people were so excited
1596648 it was a huge thing that happened in china it was like a dream at that time china wasnt an open door to the world but since then the chinese people believe that we can do well and not just in sports
1596649 i think it gave the people confidence to have a better life to connect with the rest of the world i think that was more meaningful not just our success on the volleyball court
1596650 she is such an historical figure in this country and i think thats a beautiful thing
1596651 there have been times when weve had to be her bodyguards people here just want to touch her mothers have thrown their babies at her they just want to be near her theres no parallel to that not michael jordan not anybody i think the way shes respected here is extremely unique
1596652 i dont like the term war its not a good word
1596653 this is a very unique olympic games for me because im different now
1596654 i feel back home i dont feel theres any pressure on me maybe its because im home or maybe because im more mature i feel like i can enjoy the games and enjoy the process more not just the results
1596655 it will be a great opportunity for us to showcase seattle in the summer especially since it will be broadcast nationally
1596656 were excited to show the world what makes seattle an ideal vacation city and know that the race will be a perfect kickoff to our annual seafair
1596657 running a marathon can be a little tough and this takes their mind sort of off the drudgery of it and the bands have fun
1596658 were going to have a huge shuttle program going on
1596659 were used to the masses of participants and getting everybody to the start on time thats the most important thing marymoor is in the works
1596660 thats a good idea obviously we go down those paths
1596661 i am sure they are highly motivated i think respect drives competition doesnt it i am sure the respect is mutual between the players who play for the crusaders and robbie
1596662 when you respect somebody it brings out that extra edge and i am sure they will play with that edge tomorrow night
1596663 i think because of the history of the bledisloe cup and the closeness of the two countries geographically and because of the banter between the two countries and the competition i think it adds greater magnitude
1596664 ang problema natin ngayon sa pilipinas mas importante sa atin ang wedding kaysa doon sa marriage we are more concerned with the event and not the process
1596665 personal union of individuals it is also called matrimony starts with the wedding and results to a wedlock
1596666 kaya kapag hindi sumusunod ang asawa ninyo sa napagkasunduan ang asawa ninyo ay enemy of the state
1596667 you dont get married to one person you marry into a family into a community and you are sanctioned by the state and in most cases by a religious authority
1596668 you dont get into a work contract without first discussing the terms and reading the terms but most people get into marriages in contrast without even reading the terms
1596669 let us not focus on the wedding only but on the longer term which is the marriage and you must insist to sit down and talk about the marriage not just the wedding
1596670 i realized three to four years ago na ang attitude daw ng mga tao nababago ang mga pangarap pwedeng baguhin but you know what you are stuck with your personality you can never change personality
1596671 so you have to discover and accept your partners personality because if from the start you cannot accept youre a disaster waiting to happen
1596672 actually totoo yung wife submit to your husband but also in scriptures it says submit to one another hindi lang daw wife ang nagsa submit
1596673 sabi ko hon ikaw ang software ako ang hardware syempre ako lalaki pagdating sa mga repairs expansion renovation ako yan pagdating sa pagkain beautification ikaw yan nagkasundo kami but it didnt work
1596674 masisira ang computer dalawang oras ko nang kinakalikot dadaan si maricel hon ganito lang yan tapos na buti nga kung computer lang e aircon refrigerator
1596675 this is the worst dumating yung do it yourself furniture ang aming kama at tv cabinet wala akong maintindihan sa mga manual na yun paborito ni maricel ang mga ganung manual and she did it herself eight months pregnant
1596676 it had to take another counseling session for us to realize na iba ang gifts at background namin
1596677 before you get married please find yourself first and accept yourself for who you are
1596678 bago kayo mag asawa spend more time on the following intellectual mental and spiritual connections and less time on the physical connection
1596679 once you get connected and you overly engage in physical connection you stop connecting mentally intellectually spiritually and so you dont grow so you invest there first
1596680 believe that you are complete already on your own di po totoo yung you complete me kasi kung hindi ka kumpleto huwag ka munang maga asawa
1596681 find god everyday of your life because youre gonna need him everyday of your married life
1596682 daming wedding coordinators nagdagsaan and everybody wants a marriage coordinator but not a marriage counselor wedding coordinator yes marriage counselor no baka sabihing may problema tayo
1596683 sino ba ang walang problema i have been counseled in my marriage for the last 15 years i cant do without my marriage counselor
1596684 god will bless you more and more if you give
1596685 we are all twisted image bearers living with other twisted image bearers in the presence of an untwisted god who is slowly making us straight its a process if you entrust your wedding and marriage to him he will make it straight and the best is yet to come
1596686 its not yet a done deal it was just initialed to be sure na yung napagusapan eh nandyan paguusapan pa yan sa formal talks so its not
1596687 our people do not understand this agreement there was clear lack of consultation and very few know about the contents of the agreement this proves the government used the wrong strategy to negotiate a strategy of hiding the truth and of forcing the agreement on those who will be affected
1596688 this is not the way to negotiate a peace agreement everyone must be involved and must be won over to support it if not its only a peace agreement on paper and conflict will continue
1596689 it makes no difference to the milf whether a signing takes place or not the signing ceremony is a mere formality the absence of which does not diminish invalidate or cancel the moa ad
1596690 the moa ad is the textual version of the consensus points arrived at by both parties through a long process of negotiations beginning in 2004 as a consequence of the inclusion of ancestral domain as the third aspect in the milf grp tripoli agreement on peace of 2001
1596691 the supreme court tro is a product of the on going political intramurals within the grp
1596692 not binding on the milf which is a revolutionary liberation organization of the bangsamoro people
1596693 the grp does not possess the capability of entering into a peace agreement therefore the firm commitment and political will to honor signed agreements with the moro liberation movement by the grp is under suspect of doubt by the international community
1596694 the milf has gained a significant moral and political victory in this latest chapter of its historic struggle to resolve the conflict in mindanao on the negotiating table from such a victory the milf as its policy dictates will still pursue the peace process to bring an end to the conflict without however losing sight of alternative means to achieve freedom and justice for the bangsamoro people
1596695 we came up with this fund raising in 2003 after i went to manila to attend a seminar of bantay bata 163
1596696 nakilala nila ako kasi lagi ako nagbibigay ng donation every time i watched a child in need on tv
1596697 i couldnt close my eyes i told myself i had to do something
1596698 there are probably over 3 million filipinos here in america if each household donates just 20 to bantay bata 163 that will be a big help
1596699 we will continue doing this it might not be the miss philippines but there are so many other things we can do
1596700 it may be a birthday bash a wedding anniversary but instead of gifts they can just give to bantay bata
1596701 kasi mula mag attend ako ng seminar hindi na mawala sa isip ko yung mga bata i think each one of us should try to do what we can more importantly i think that is one way of thanking the lord for giving us a normal life
1596702 im so blessed to have three beautiful children who are healthy we have health insurance we have a means to take care of them i know the kids out there dont have that and i want to instill in my children the value that we as filipinos know in our culture love one another help each other no matter what
1596703 the initial position of the kbp was to support the calls for decriminalization however we received reactions from our own practitioners broadcast journalists pointing out that decriminalization would potentially increase violence against journalists because those who have been victimized by libel would have no recourse or would have limited recourse
1596704 while mr arroyo has withdrawn the charges the message sent is clear
1596705 in this modern day and age journalists spending time in prison for their work is anathema to a democracy
1596706 journalists report on public figures politicians and government institutions our work is central to a democracy where accurate and honest writing investigative reporting and critical opinion grounded on sound analysis help strengthen institutions rather than diminish them
1596707 we support a bill that would decriminalize libel insofar as public officials and matters of public interest are concerned but if the subjects of a libel are private persons when it is purely a private matter criminal libel should be retained
1596708 it will be a giant step towards strengthening of the democratic process in our land when freedom of expression is enshrined
1596709 we have to be honest my perception is that most of the legislators and government officials do not want to decriminalize libel because it is always the public officials who are the subject of news
1596710 being a government official for a number of years ive been always hearing comments from fellow public officials that the press can make or unmake a public officials
1596711 our congressmen know the situation and importance of press freedom
1596712 there are efforts of individual organizations to make staff members observe ethical standards some news organizations do investigate and have suspended their staff
1596713 at the same time public officials and those in government should get to know how media organizations work so that they become more tolerant of honest reporting and dissenting opinion
1596714 justice becomes an instrument for deterrence rather than a means of giving each person his due
1596715 has everything possible been done that will limit the collateral deaths
1596716 we came up with this fund raising in 2003 after i went to manila to attend a seminar of bantay bata 163
1596717 nakilala nila ako kasi lagi ako nagbibigay ng donation every time i watched a child in need on tv
1596718 i couldnt close my eyes i told myself i had to do something
1596719 there are probably over 3 million filipinos here in america if each household donates just 20 to bantay bata 163 that will be a big help
1596720 we will continue doing this it might not be the miss philippines but there are so many other things we can do
1596721 it may be a birthday bash a wedding anniversary but instead of gifts they can just give to bantay bata
1596722 kasi mula mag attend ako ng seminar hindi na mawala sa isip ko yung mga bata i think each one of us should try to do what we can more importantly i think that is one way of thanking the lord for giving us a normal life
1596723 im so blessed to have three beautiful children who are healthy we have health insurance we have a means to take care of them i know the kids out there dont have that and i want to instill in my children the value that we as filipinos know in our culture love one another help each other no matter what
1596724 life sustaining treatments and vegetative state scientific advances and ethical dilemmas
1596725 surely the provision of food and water to those unable to do it for themselves is a medical act and should be considered as one of the possible medical acts that may or may not be given to those in a pvs
1596726 surely the provision of food and water is sometimes an extraordinary act not normal care and thus not always morally obligatory
1596727 sufficient to defend against the aggressor and to protect the safety of persons
1596728 well i better decide which is truly the right policy else i will be sinning
1596729 favorable and unfavorable polyunsaturated fatty acids found in commonly eaten fish
1596730 suppose that the church authoritatively teaches that when action a is performed under circumstances c then it is sinful then a catholic must assent to that moral statement
1596731 but judging whether the circumstances c actually hold is a prudential judgment that the church has no special authority for so the churchs opinion on whether circumstances c do actually hold must be given respect but its never required to give it more than respect
1596732 if you tell me your armys plans i will give you a house and money
1596733 as a result of steady improvements in the organization of the penal system
1596734 it gives me a lot of confidence puts me in a really good frame of mind going into the pga championship and the rest of the season
1596735 i used bad judgment in being in the wrong place at the wrong time and ive learned from my mistake
1596736 got to do better or im going to have to get out of here
1596737 this entire case rests upon the statement of adam pacman jones
1596738 after making a deal with the state where felony charges were dismissed so that he could get himself reinstated with the nfl
1596739 i was in witness protection last year im out now
1596740 i can come out and do my thing a little bit and have fun with this team because this team is a lot of fun
1596741 while in vend e he had explained that the motto of the french republic was intrinsically perverse
1596742 belongs to the old russian tradition homophobic at the limits of anti semitism very marked by the ancient feudal era that he so admired i feel very far removed from that political tradition
1596743 the world of the gulag was denounced from the beginning but it was denounced by people of the left in particular communists
1596744 the apology for solzhenitsyn as a great thinker of democracy against stalinism makes me sick because i think about all those unfortunate ones who from the very first waged their battles without being showered with honors baubles of gold residences protections of all sorts as solzhenitsyn was for the sole reason that he was of the right
1596745 missed the morning practice because they taped me up to a chair but at least i got it over with
1596746 i had a really good excuse too i couldnt get out
1596747 that makes it more of a partner with the city in sharing revenue
1596748 the biggest news out of beijing leading up to the olympics this week was
1596749 i believe my microwave oven will be carrying synchronized swimming most of next week
1596750 being here is great but this wasnt the real show
1596751 it was like an audition for the olympics we passed the pre olympic test but now were going to go and take care of business
1596752 this is rehearsal now were getting ready for the big game
1596753 ive been to three olympics games and this diamond ball is by far the best in terms of preparation
1596754 everyone has their full teams and the top three teams in the world are here its a great lead up to the olympics
1596755 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1596756 hes behind but well work to get him up to speed and we know hes the kind of player who will get himself caught up
1596757 right from the start through the draft and minicamps he has shown us things that are innate to successful nfl linebackers
1596758 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1596759 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1596760 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1596761 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1596762 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1596763 people seem to recognize me everywhere and its been great
1596764 the event will not only showcase one of the worlds most beautiful racetracks but also will generate more than 100 million for the california economy
1596765 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1596766 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1596767 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1596768 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1596769 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1596770 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1596771 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1596772 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1596773 the duraheart gives us a new third generation option for patients with advanced heart failure who need help to allow them to survive until they can receive a heart transplant
1596774 this trial will test the durahearts potential to overcome some of the issues that have been seen with other devices including hemolysis caused by shear stress on red blood cells and clotting risk caused by blood that does not circulate rapidly enough from all areas of the chamber
1596775 it also remains to be seen if this device offers superior durability which might make it useful as a destination therapy that could remove the need for a heart transplant
1596776 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1596777 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1596778 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1596779 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area

1596870 they dont have to think about someone creeping up behind them i just want to give them peace of mind
1596871 going into my second year i think the biggest challenge is not thinking i had some success last year and doing the same thing staley said
1596872 its about always improving always using every opportunity whether its in the weight room or the practice field or the film room
1596873 youd have to put 200 pounds on that doll staley jokes now
1596874 probably one of the best moves we ever made coach mike nolan said
1596875 choking smoker dont you know the joker laughs at you
1596876 i would suspect well add one defenseman through a trade and if we have to add two then maybe one through free agency
1596877 but that free agency is going to be tough this year with so many teams looking for them defensemen so i dont know what direction its going to go
1596878 we need a defenseman that can play in our top four and play a lot in brets case and glens case they played in key roles we cant just go after a depth defenseman and think were going to be able to compete were going to have to go after a good defenseman
1596879 not at all and they havent brought it up to me
1596880 thats what theyre there for thats their job to do and my job is to perform on the ice when im asked to and thats where my focus is
1596881 its continuing to grow and thats a great thing to see
1596882 were continuing to build off of it and im looking forward to next season and hopefully following the same route

1596891 ive had a wonderful career and i feel blessed ive been able to end it on such a positive note
1596892 he was always in great shape he skated really well defensively i dont think he ever got the credit that he deserved for how good of a defenseman he was probably the most important thing with all of that he was a great teammate and a better person
1596893 a lot of people criticized what we did but in my opinion in order to build a winning team and have a successful franchise you have to build with character people
1596894 that was a step to bring in a good player and a good defenseman with great character
1596895 the thing that made me feel so good about this ride with glen was to see him hoist that stanley cup that was his goal to come and help this organization win the stanley cup and he did
1596896 hes one of the older players in the league although by no means the oldest and he works harder than most younger guys
1596897 he is capable of playing and will play in our top nine forwards
1596898 he already had a good year scoring 20 goals we have to hope he stays healthy and gets back to the level we expect of him
1596899 we we can do anything why do they beat us down with their lies
1596900 yes i see you but i choose to ignore you because i dont feel like acknowledging you because i dont really know you that well

1596923 wachovias new management has pulled its head of out the sand and is fully acknowledging the problems not challenges
1596924 while the companys wealth management corporate and investment banks and capital management groups all had more encouraging results than the general bank the general bank is the bulk of wachovia and it isnt performing well
1596925 while this is a difficult decision it is the best course for our shareholders over the long term

1596962 he just started making some mistakes he was getting up there as far as his pitch count and started to elevate his pitches a little bit thats a dangerous club over there they swing the bats

1596979 ive been working every day with ty crosby said referring to hitting coach ty van burkelo figuring a few things out
1596980 hey there is enough pressure out here just have fun like youre on a little league field just getting guys out then you take that kind of fun into your next game
1596981 it kind of reminds you of what baseball is all about thats why we all started doing this then all of a sudden its involving fans and money and stuff things got complicated
1596982 it gives the hitters a chance to face a left hander and theres baserunners out there working on their jumps and reading a left hander
1596983 were going to talk about him tonight and see what were going to do tomorrow
1596984 i dont know what day but hes here now and has been throwing flat ground like noah lowry
1596985 hes going to be off the mound here in a couple of days
1596986 were going to keep the option open at short or second
1596987 a lot depends on the makeup of the club next year and who were going to have at short or second he can go either place
1596988 then it would be some kind of joke i guess

1597024 if youre going to take aid to low income families seriously then youre going to make riskier loans
1597025 like a property and casualty company you get hit with a flood its a huge problem
1597026 the place didnt have enough orientation towards its housing mission
1597027 the fact is they were under pressure to buy some of these loans
1597028 youve got a troubled national economy an extreme housing correction and volatile financial markets which sell as soon as theres a whiff of fear
1597029 hes always been that kind of guy intellectual pragmatic and politically smart
1597030 the data demonstrated a clear and consistent prejudice and it took leadership to acknowledge
1597031 more than that he just has a conscience hes a person of conscience who tries every day to do the right thing
1597032 but he didnt have the technology vision required by thermo
1597033 but its less likely that im going to get trampled under its feet

1597038 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information

1597040 there were a number of real drivers of the value behind this deal that speak to our pipeline our pharmacogenomics expertise and our diagnostics and therapeutics development abilities
1597041 this is a market that is already known to us and comfortable for us and adding an opportunity like stedivaze will layer in very nicely on top of that expertise we have already established
1597042 this has potential benefits in terms of targeting the drugs early to the right patient population and being able to streamline and make more efficient the whole development program
1597043 i really truly wish i could you know but im still in pain
1597044 like the kind of pain you might have if someone poured acid all over your body and then threw you into a wood chipper

1597065 claims by labour that mr brown is best able to steer the country through the economic crisis are simply not believed labours reputation for economic competence has been torn to shreds
1597066 labour now finds itself facing a serious and respected opposition for the first time
1597067 mr cameron remains relatively popular and is thought more capable than brown but not all the stardust has transferred to his party
1597068 currently there is no impact to production and no personnel have been evacuated
1597069 we will talk to the higher education ministry the college management and the private education department on what can be done
1597070 from a licensing point of view the college still exists it just does not have a site to operate from
1597071 kita juga ingin mengetahui apakah pihak pengurusan kolej mempunyai tempat lain untuk menempatkan pengajian pelajar terbabit
1597072 bagi kita masalah ini mesti dicari jalan penyelesaian segera bukan kerana ia membabitkan lebih 700 pelajar tetapi pengajian kolej ini sendiri yang menawarkan sembilan jenis kursus yang mengkhususkan bidang penyiaran kewartawanan dan multimedia
1597073 the relationship was consensual and it ended earlier this year after a period of some months
1597074 i take responsibility for my being involved in this relationship and i regret the hurt caused to anyone including my family
1597075 i feel this statement is warranted to put the facts in context given the media interest
1597076 i have medical advice that i am suffering from depression and have been for some time
1597077 i hope that the media will respect the privacy of myself and my family as i make my recovery
1597078 i wish to thank all those people who have expressed their good wishes and offers of support
1597079 we were running the induction programme yesterday which was supposed to finish at 5pm but at 4pm we were told to stop we did not know what to do when we saw people taking things away the management has not informed us anything
1597080 weve asked to see the top management of sal college three times but to no avail instead they kept sending a management representative we are always in the dark as to what is really going on
1597081 we pay a fee of rm18 000 which should be enough to replace or repair the missing or broken equipment and to maintain the building
1597082 weve never had enough lecturers for some strange reason the lecturers at the college kept changing
1597083 the tnpcb does not maintain any electronic copies of documents such as permits and authorizations issued or inspection reports and public hearing minutes
1597084 we use the computers as typewriters we delete the files after taking printouts
1597085 i hope the board is lying about deleting the files
1597086 heres a government agency that is actively de computerising if it is speaking the truth the boards action represent a monumental waste of public resources
1597087 the obligation on the part of the public authority has not been fulfilled
1597088 a maldives red crescent society or a maldivian red crescent society or why not a dhivehi red crescent society
1597089 kasih tidak menyimpan kesalahan orang lain ia menutupi segala sesuatu percaya segala sesuatu mengharapkan segala sesuatu sabar menanggung segala sesuatu
1597090 im still beginning my own review of my agency with respect to what our relationship was with this family and what the nature of our services were
1597091 i need a chance to convene my people look at the electronic database at the agency and just have a sense of if weve had activity and to what extent
1597092 we received this information with profound sadness and well do what we can at our agency to be as transparent as possible with respect to our involvement and to see what we can learn from something like this
1597093 this is not our typical experience at native child so im basically asking for some patience let me absorb this and have a look at the situation and whatever its a terrible day for us
1597094 donna was an all right person i dont know what happened

1597097 through our community based system of care the well being of our children has become a priority to the people of the state of florida
1597098 it is imperative that we continue to work diligently to make sure each child in florida finds the adoptive family they need i thank governor crist for raising the publics awareness of this important issue
1597099 this years achievements are a result of the dedication and commitment of our partners and community members
1597100 through a streamlined approach fsmo and its partners have worked to provide the community with services that enhance the efficiency of the overall child welfare system as well as provide safer communities for our children and families moving forward we look forward to continuing and building on our existing partnerships with a specific focus on engaging corporations churches and individuals in the community

1597112 the dry yamuna presented such a pathetic and deplorable scene that people often would ask us why shah jahan chose this site to build such a monument but right now the river is full and flowing majestically
1597113 this would mean that we could deliver lower dosages of drugs to specific cells and tissues in the body and actually be more effective in treating the cancer
1597114 if we can design particles that rely on the same mechanisms that nature has perfected for bacteria we may unlock the key for delivering therapeutics more efficiently and effectively to treat and cure disease
1597115 traffic movement was affected at many places the roads in the capital have many potholes adding to the woes of drivers
1597116 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1597117 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1597118 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1597119 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1597120 ik ben een kritisch lid van het internationaal olympisch comit ioc mijn argument is niet alleen de traditie maar ook de zeer hoge kosten
1597121 saya sebagai wakil belia akan berbincang dengan ibu bapa dan wakil pelajar untuk membawa masalah ini kepada kementerian berkenaan agar pelajar dapat meneruskan pengajian mereka dalam masa terdekat
1597122 pagi tadi dua pegawai dari kementerian pengajian tinggi datang untuk melihat keadaan kolej dan mengambil kenyataan daripada beberapa pelajar kami tunggu apa yang kementerian boleh lakukan untuk menolong kamu semua pelajar
1597123 kami tidak mendapat apaapa maklumat daripada pihak kolej apa yang kami tahu kolej ini disita sebab tidak bayar sewa bangunan dan kami cuba menghubungi pihak atasan tapi gagal
1597124 saya juga kecewa apabila pelajar baru yang telah membayar yuran pengajian tidak dapat meneruskan pengajian mereka
1597125 saya amat kecewa dan rasa terkejut apabila kolej ini disita anak saya dah pun belajar hampir separuh jalan dan saya dapati pihak pengurusan kolej juga seolah olah bersikap lepas tangan
1597126 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
1597127 peaceful olympics on july 28 in the capital city of guangdong province china over 100 000 people are patrolling and guarding main routes and entrances all over guangzhou at the top of the list to be searched and interrogated are foreigners

1597133 i think its going to make a lot of peoples families suffer they wont be able to pay their rent or have money to even survive or pay their bills i think its going to have a bad impact on the community
1597134 thats the only place that you get to work here theres like 500 people that will be out of a job
1597135 i relied on it quite a bit at the time because that is the only job you can get where you can actually make close to 9 00 an hour starting off up to 300 a week

1597139 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is flawless
1597140 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me if you really knew me you would know my father as well from now on you do know him and have seen him
1597141 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven
1597142 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1597143 as incumbent on me and on us in the diocese to actively labor to both understand the position of those to whom that moratorium is important and to convey the reality of our life together to the world
1597144 there is nothing generous about asking the lgbt faithful to bear the burden of unity of the anglican communion on their shoulders and there is no theological defense for sacrificing a minority of the baptized to the will of a majority
1597145 yeah it was in the right spot and thats how it is
1597146 sometimes you hit the ball hard and have nothing to show for it its about where you hit the ball and when and my ball happened to be in the right spot
1597147 i was able to put a good swing on it knew it was gone when i hit it and it was a pretty good feeling
1597148 it certainly has not been abused it may be underutilized
1597149 the bottom line from our perspective is it may very well have saved lives
1597150 in every case i was involved in i thought it was an abuse
1597151 the overriding concern is anybody can report anybody with or without substantiation and i dont think that is the american way
1597152 continues to invest unusual and far reaching powers in police authority that does not belong there
1597153 police to act as psychologists in trying to predict and interpret behavior
1597154 the way this law is written it can and will be easily abused by police

1597169 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1597170 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1597171 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1597172 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1597173 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

1597175 i said you know what you can inflate your tires to the proper levels and that if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil wed get from john mccain drilling right below his feet there or wherever he was going to drill
1597176 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1597177 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

1597195 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1597196 i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy
1597197 oilman driller he says we cant drill our way out of the problem i think he knows more about it than john mccain
1597198 strongly encouraged by sen obamas speech on americas energy future
1597199 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1597200 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1597201 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1597202 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into

1597208 i think i might be farming on a different planet were talking about a few intensive acres and ill be selling my stuff direct not through a brokerage or a distributor its possible that ill get 10 times those prices by selling to local markets here
1597209 this is my first year in business i dont have three years of records yet
1597210 do you get many people like me calling you up and asking for loans new young farmers who are selling direct and local
1597211 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority
1597212 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1597213 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1597214 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1597215 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1597216 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1597217 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1597218 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1597219 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1597220 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1597221 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1597222 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1597223 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1597224 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1597225 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1597226 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1597227 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1597228 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1597229 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1597230 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1597231 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1597232 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1597233 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1597234 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1597235 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1597236 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1597237 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1597238 change his attitude and perform more than one moral gesture in recognition of the pain and suffering caused to the families of his victims
1597239 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1597240 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1597241 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1597242 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1597243 i feel flattered that the nra would feel that they would have to infiltrate ceasefire of pa obviously theyre hearing our footsteps
1597244 frankly i think its a waste of their money we dont deal in state secrets
1597245 more than 75 of waste that goes into landfills comes from businesses food waste and food contaminated paper make up nearly 30 of that total
1597246 in portland alone this equals about 54 tons of food and food contaminated paper waste per year that can be eliminated from our landfills
1597247 we are pretty environmentally minded here so composting seemed like the right thing to do but without assistance it was messy workers didnt like having to wash out the composting containers everyday and frankly we had no place to take the food to be composted or a way to haul it ourselves the citys program now makes it easy
1597248 currently there is no local composting facility that can handle this amount of food waste we have to ship it up to maple valley in washington which causes concerns that we are using quite a bit of fossil fuels in the process thus negating the environmental benefits of the program
1597249 if i had a partner she could turn out the light for me she could take the syringe and throw it in the wastebasket

1597252 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1597253 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1597254 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1597255 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1597256 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1597257 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1597258 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1597259 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1597260 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1597261 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1597262 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1597263 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1597264 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1597265 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1597266 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1597267 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1597268 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1597269 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1597270 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1597271 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1597272 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1597273 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1597274 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1597275 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1597276 to discourage me is no easy matter the life of california pioneer william goodwin dana

1597286 there is no shortage of supplies nor is there meat chicken or sugar and milk only from time to time
1597287 the reading of the legal decree against monopolizing gives the sensation that civil society has become an enemy of the state and they are declaring war such a civil society does not consist of the great proprietors of the capital but the local owner of a wine shop taxi owners the butchers fishermen the agriculturists etc
1597288 you do not know who youre messing with you dont know who i am i am going to close down this joint mr portuguese i know the owner of this building and i am going to have them kick you out
1597289 castro communism advances in all the forms and colors we spoke yesterday of how the stocks of car dealerships were exhausted probably due to the record number of new automobile purchases in our country today it is the cell phone that is hard to come by
1597290 you want to do the right thing but you have to be financially responsible
1597291 the number one benefit for us is that i know the people who grow this food thats huge and its good stuff it hasnt lost its vitamins in transit
1597292 in terms of quality theres no comparison because it is so fresh it might not always be as pretty but the taste is there
1597293 instead of looking at a computer screen and ordering 24 cases of this or that i call solveig the farmers came this winter and we sat down to plan what theyre going to grow for me this year its very very cool
1597294 knowing ahead of time where the food will be sold is key
1597295 weve had customers tell us oh dont worry about a few dings in the tomatoes were going to dice them up anyway
1597296 the more we are able to talk with our customers and make sure we understand them the better we do
1597297 we have no models no rules for this even within other cooperatives this is a unique venture
1597298 i wish we could have the stability in our lives that we see our customers have in theirs
1597299 and well make our own potato salad and guaranteed our residents will like our recipe better
1597300 the governor took an action that could endanger the livelihood of 200 000 state employees and families and put state taxpayers in a precarious position
1597301 it can be overwhelming when you dont know the rules and regulations
1597302 in a small business where capital isnt overflowing it might not have enough money to pay consultants or a lawyer
1597303 you cant just arbitrarily pick the definition you want in order to satisfy an argument
1597304 has given us his word that no tenants will be asked to vacate their units and that we may continue to rent and occupy our units for as long as we choose
1597305 how you allocate the units i dont know how to answer that question
1597306 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1597307 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1597308 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1597309 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1597310 a clash between a dissident group of catholics and the diocese of rockville centre over how much the diocese has in the bank and what it ought to do with the money reflects a national church debate over how to best use its funds
1597311 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1597312 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1597313 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1597314 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1597315 i think its more of a nod to experience and seniority
1597316 the ultimate goal is to be able to go there with the first team and im going to have the opportunity to do that be out there with my guys
1597317 i just want to have fun and execute move the ball down the field
1597318 i cant put so much pressure on myself that i need to be perfect every play i hope i am but if something goes wrong its not the end of the world
1597319 i have a bunch of starts under my belt and lots of game experience
1597320 were going to balance those guys plays out through training camp
1597321 kyle has been here so thats why hes getting the first game
1597322 how i play in these games is going to determine whos going to be the starter
1597323 every one of these games is extremely important you get very limited plays so you have to take advantage of every throw you have and do everything you can to win that job
1597324 when the bobcats hired him it showed me they were committed to making the franchise better
1597325 hiring larry brown an elite coach you have to take notice of that
1597326 larry brown he brings a certain dynamic and insight to the game that would make most teams better
1597327 i think hes a perfect fit for us our team is young we are hard working and he can give us that discipline and those little insights to the game that will take us to the next level
1597328 hopefully in the back of my mind i wanted to be a bobcat
1597329 sometimes things dont work out the way you want them to in this case they did worrying about the contract negotiations and stuff that would have been just extra stress that i really didnt need to have
1597330 he might not have been nervous but im sure we were in a lot of ways
1597331 i was a college player so i knew i wasnt going to see the light of day
1597332 im not going to disrespect my new teammates or my organization by making excuses i have a chance to write a new legacy for myself
1597333 i definitely hope hell see in me what a lot of people dont see
1597334 i think ive been one of the underrated defensive players in the league
1597335 im in a situation where no ones expecting nothing so whatever i give is going to be a plus as long as i play hard and play smart
1597336 its the first time where i was able to pick where i wanted to go
1597337 im just happy to be a detroit piston it just seems like a first class organization
1597338 theyre taught the dynamics of the ocean such as where rip currents are located and how to use them to their advantage

1597359 sen obama has said expanding our nuclear power plants quote doesnt make sense for america unquote
1597360 he also says no to nuclear storage and no to nuclear processing i could not disagree more
1597361 supports safe and secure nuclear energy however before an expansion of nuclear power is considered obama thinks key issues must be addressed including security of nuclear fuel and waste waste storage and proliferation
1597362 i saw sen obamas latest attack has to do with oil and campaign contributions
1597363 i think he might be a little bit confused because when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it sen obama voted for it people care not only what you say but how you vote
1597364 the congress and the cpi m are appeasing the illegal migrants everyone knows it both parties are concerned about losing their vote banks and are silent on the issue bjp is a better party in this respect
1597365 none of the governments in the seven north eastern states are serious about the issue all the governments and the parties of the region should sit together and discuss it before it is too late

1597395 the unsealed documents should answer the outstanding questions regarding the findings in this case
1597396 what troubles me is that mr ivins wasnt indicted and if he wasnt indicted how confidant are they that they had the evidence and the information that they needed
1597397 the only thing that has changed is that he has committed suicide
1597398 i think its important to give all of us victims and the american people information that they can share and some appreciation of the overall state of the investigation
1597399 but i also think its important given the mistakes made in the past that they are not jumping to premature conclusions
1597400 all of us dont think he had anything to do with it
1597401 i just have to see what theyve got you work mostly with scientists and they say show me the data you look at what youve got make a decision and then act on it

1597407 i just know we were at practice today and favre wasnt there and im the starter
1597408 i think weve been pretty united throughout this whole thing its definitely been difficult for all parties involved but weve tried to stay focused as a team
1597409 its gone on long enough the franchise needs to say one way or another we want brett or we dont want brett if they dont do it then brett needs to say he wants to be here or not be here
1597410 for them to keep us in the dark and have us answering a bunch of questions we cant possibly have a good answer for that isnt fair to us something needs to be said yea or nay for brett favre
1597411 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction
1597412 and listening to him talk about that you respect his opinion and frankly i told him i said ill take responsibility because i have a voice in the building i never thought he truly was going to play i thought he was emotionally driven for other reasons
1597413 i am glad i brought this monster to its knees

1597463 feeling full on 3 a day is one challenge eating nutritionally is virtually impossible illinois democratic rep jan schakowskys weeks worth of fruits and vegetables consisted of one tomato one potato a head of lettuce and five bananas
1597464 this is such an unhealthy diet i am trying to eat the most healthy food i can afford but i have no problem imagining how someone eating like this could quickly develop diabetes or high cholesterol and with all these carbs i can see how easy it would be to gain a fair amount of weight
1597465 attempting to address the economic disparity in the availability of healthy foods
1597466 as a society we dont cook as much as we used to and that particularly impacts people with lower incomes and higher stress
1597467 but the cost of food is rising rapidly at this point and the purchasing power of those food dollars has been eroding weve been working hard on the federal farm bill and the food stamp program thats really benefited a lot of people were trying to help people with limited resources get access to healthy foods with programs like farmers market vouchers
1597468 its now at all four of the portland farmers markets along with several other farmers markets in the area
1597469 at this point its just a matter of getting the word out
1597470 when theres a greater supply of organics in the marketplace were going to see that reflected back in donations
1597471 pacific natural foods is a good friend of the food bank and theyre our 1 donor so their stuff shows up on our shelves
1597472 what we see in our clients is the choice between buying food and paying the electric bill this week the problem of food insecurity the biggest thing they want is a shelf stable product because many of them dont have a stove or a refrigerator freezer many of them are living in vehicles or tents going from campsite to campsite
1597473 our mission statement includes addressing the root causes of hunger and we do concentrate on providing people with tools to move from a food box to a food secure home again
1597474 through the businesses we cultivate as partners such as amys kitchen an exclusively organic company which opened a plant in medford a few years ago
1597475 if we get a lot of pumpkin mix for instance
1597476 julie will figure out easy recipes for pumpkin bars or pumpkin soup that our clients can do themselves
1597477 last month we had 40 palettes of amys organic frozen pizza

1597479 i dont have any quantifiable information but we dont have much of a dropout rate one of the things that happens is that it becomes something around which a family can work together
1597480 it is just so frustrating to get to the produce aisle knowing that you have to take that conventional product
1597481 knowing your children are eating something thats questionable is really hard its important to remember the emotional element of that
1597482 sticker shock organics and healthier foods are more available but not everyone can afford them

1597487 operations in our holdings continued to perform well during the second quarter despite a slowdown in several parts of the retail sector the action programs and structural changes under way in the companies have started to have an impact and we can see that we are heading in the right direction in most areas the challenge now as before is to have a clear approach to the market regardless of whether this concerns price assortment or accessibility at the same time as keeping costs under firm control successful retail operations are built up over time and put simply this involves a number of unique details rather than molding operations according to a set formula in our opinion it is the streamlined and innovative businesses that will be the winners in the future as well
1597488 this acquisition gives us access to a customer portfolio that provides a very good fit for our business and will give us added expertise and resources in areas such as sales and marketing
1597489 the transaction is based on hafslunds desire to take an active role in the current restructuring of the norwegian security market through this transaction with securitas direct we are facilitating the further development of hafslund sikkerhet and creating a stable and customer focused supplier of security services

1597534 once we found the book with his name we knew right away where to go

1597537 it cannot be overstated that brandon is a tragic victim
1597538 he came in here shooting at the people and looked at brandon and aimed right at him

1597542 ive been very aware very quickly that roosevelt boulevard is a serious challenge for motorists for pedestrians and actually for law enforcement
1597543 weve seen far too many accidents and casualties and there is a fear of dealing with roosevelt boulevard because of the difficulties of this particular road
1597544 this signals another step in our continuing effort to make this unique highway as safe as possible for all who travel along it either by foot or by vehicle
1597545 the goal is zero fatalities on the boulevard and we will continue to strive to have that happen
1597546 i felt real safe today with all the police and everyone else around
1597547 dont look into any of these decisions that weve made right now
1597548 its a starting spot and theres no rhyme or reason as to why were going this direction its just the way i want to go right now
1597549 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1597550 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1597551 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1597552 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1597553 workers can rest assured that all those who participate in the strike will be protected by law except for those performing genuinely essential services
1597554 the biggest strike that the city has seen in the last few years
1597555 did not seek nor obtain my approval before taking its decision
1597556 apparently its happening everywhere from people stealing manhole covers from people breaking into foreclosed homes
1597557 i think one of the overriding things is that im interested in bringing crime to the national agenda
1597558 something that two years ago wouldnt have been worthwhile now it is
1597559 the prices have doubled and tripled the prices that are driving the crime are making it worthwhile to engage in this kind of thievery
1597560 in my opinion the guy that gets laid off from gm doesnt get a gun and do an armed robbery but youre seeing people doing shoplifting that dont really have a criminal record
1597561 it took a year or two before you saw it show up in actual crime whos the person stealing bread stealing food

1597594 the biggest concern in my intellectual life has been how we as a country can hold together given our differences
1597595 more prosperous more vital its going to make us stronger
1597596 it was a painful and bitter defeat for all of us
1597597 and it sent us into a period of soul searching
1597598 the economic argument will be the one that turns the american people around on this issue which right now is so emotional and lacking in rational discussion
1597599 reinventing the melting pot the new immigrants and what it means to be american
1597600 of course however hard they work many poor ill educated immigrants who start at the bottom of the ladder remain there throughout their lives
1597601 this is not particularly surprising and it may seem to vindicate those who claim that the united states today is importing a new lower class
1597602 but thats part of the point of our immigration policy america no longer has this kind of working class and it turns out that we need one
1597603 whos going to be telling their representative how to vote on this the people who have a real stake in it and thats small and mid sized business
1597604 i think we need a virtual wall we need to know whos crossing the border
1597605 and that by definition leads to draconian and inhumane actions
1597606 ill come in and say other states have done this before you
1597607 opposition the over my dead body opposition of the anti immigrant right was red hot
1597608 opponents were loud angry unrelenting and terrifying to members of congress particularly those coming up soon for reelection
1597609 i think tamar jacoby understands the immigration issue better than anyone else in the country
1597610 an obnoxious robo cheerleader for the big business open borders side
1597611 when it becomes a two sided debate in the center which is where most americans pay attention to politics
1597612 i can honestly say the quality of their presentation was extremely high

1597618 what does m4a stand for many people have questions about m4a since it is relatively new m4a stands for mpeg 4 audio and it is a popular file extension used to represent audio files most people are familiar with mp3 and how it shrinks down the file size of songs and other audio files m4a and mp4 do the same thing as mp3 does but even better quality is better and file sizes are usually smaller than mp3 files but unlike mp3 no licenses or payments are required to be able to stream or distribute content in m4a format unlike mp3 which requires you to pay royalties on content you distribute in mp3 format this fact alone is more than enough reason due to the extreme cost savings to use m4a files instead of mp3 files in addition m4a files tend to sound much better than mp3 files encoded at the same bitrate what is the difference between m4a and mp4 files i am a bit confused this is the most popular question we get and seems to cause the most confusion to people new to mpeg 4 audio the existance of 2 different file extensions that can be used to represent mpeg 4 audio files is unfortunate mp4 files may or may not contain mpeg 4 audio if you see a m4a file you always know that it contains only mpeg 4 audio apple computer started using and popularizing the m4a file extension to denote the file was an unprotected non digital rights management mpeg 4 audio file they did this because mp4 was too general video video audio or audio and might confuse some media players now mpeg 4 audio has its own file extensions m4a to avoid any possible problems with being confused with video files it is recommended that you use the m4a file extension rather than mp4 on your audio files up until recently there was much confusion among mp4 m4a encoder and player software some programs nero compaact used mp4 while others winamp 5 02 apple itunes ipod used m4a to denote mpeg 4 audio files most software developers have now enabled a user selectable option in their software to allow you to choose the default file extension you wish to use to save mpeg 4 audio files with almost all audio players will now play back files using either the m4a or mp4 file extension for maximum compatibility after all both the m4a and mp4 container file formats are the same they just have different file extensions if your software program doesnt recognize your file extension you can rename the file extension to the other one i e m4a or mp4 and it should work

1597665 dan engkau juga pasti dibenci orang tuamu karena mereka menamaimu muawiyah yang memiliki arti lain pelacur yang menggonggong dan menjilat bagai anjing pen
1597666 engkau yang harus diam wahai muawiyah dia tidak memanggil muawiyah dengan sebutan amirul mukminin pen karena aku punya seorang ibu yang memberiku pedang yang pernah kupakai menghadapimu kemudian kami pernah memberikan baiat kami padamu untuk mendengar dan mematuhimu selama engkau memerintah kami dengan dasar firman allah jadi bila engkau penuhi janjimu kami akan tetap setia padamu dan bila engkau langgar janjimu ingatlah bahwa di belakang kami berdiri banyak para ksatria bersenjata yang tidak akan tinggal diam melihat penyimpanganmu

1597670 hai engkau musuh allah apakah engkau berpikir bahwa allah tidak melihat saat engkau melakukan perbuatan dosa

1597686 reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling
1597687 we were all standing around looking at each other and saying has anybody seen that play
1597688 that was one of the more interesting plays youll ever see
1597689 now is probably the time to get a lottery ticket
1597690 how many times do you see a ball do that on the wall
1597691 it has nothing to do with my skill level or anything
1597692 weve been a part of some weird plays out on the fence this year the ball hadnt carried as well here as it normally does especially to left field he really tattooed the ball and it stayed in gload made a phenomenal play just pulling that ball back in and just keeping it from being a homer because i think it was going to roll the other side
1597693 we even considered it a little bit at the deadline
1597694 if you think about what hes done over the last few years hes been a fairly productive offensive player
1597695 now this year hes having a down year but i think when you look at the numbers a little bit more than just the baseball card stats you see that theres maybe a little more to it i think getting in this environment will put him in a better situation
1597696 brendan is a young guy with a lot of future when he was playing enough it was kind of acceptable but now he isnt playing enough felipe is a better fit brendans got his whole career ahead of him
1597697 the second baseman played pretty well today the other guy is hitting 300 and cesar is picking everything in sight
1597698 lopez can play some outfield play some second short he can also play third base well see when he gets here
1597699 to get a game pitched so well up until the ninth and then to have the outcome the way it did in terms of a home run hit walk its tough
1597700 obviously were not in a situation where we can really go out and necessarily find someone to close were very supportive of izzy and weve stood by him but at some point weve got to get some results
1597701 we have to be open minded and just try to make the best decision for this club you look at how carpenter pitched today how outstanding he was he gave this team more than a chance to win and it got down to the ninth and we just couldnt put it away
1597702 one bad break the roller that would have been two outs that was a tough break but theres no doubt they got some base hits before and after that so i dont know got to think about it but i guarantee theres nobody more disappointed than izzy right now he didnt get the save carp didnt get the win theres nothing to be gained by piling on
1597703 i just want to listen to tony and dunc about what all our available options are
1597704 someone brought up rookie chris perez whats a change of strategy with maybe a different formula that might work were not going to be able to go out and necessarily trade for someone to be that closer
1597705 and izzy may get that opportunity thats for tony and dunc to let me know im not ruling that out at all right now i think right now people are answering things with more emotion than real thought but its something that regardless of how you look at it its a frustrating situation when you think of how weve lost a lot of these games late in the game a lot of them come to mind its unfortunate
1597706 we actually had agreed on terms we were right there things just didnt pan out i just want to let fans know that im not the one that pulled it off the table that we just didnt see eye to eye on a couple things and that was it
1597707 there were a lot of points that we agreed on and just couldnt quite get there so we decided not to let it drag on throughout the whole year weve had discussions with webb at this point theyre tabled but we have a lot of time to revisit the topic
1597708 we were close it didnt get done and there are no talks going on right now
1597709 were going to let brandon focus on the rest of the season and hopefully the playoffs
1597710 my concern was we might finish after them even though they started on the west coast and they would get to watch us
1597711 zumaya is one of the toughest relievers to hit off of and to hit like that in the 14th after waiting its unreal
1597712 it feels like youre hitting by sound at that point
1597713 hes one of those guys that throws a very plus plus fastball and in that situation all you can do is put the bat on the ball you generate so much power on his fastball that if you hit the ball solidly which is rare its gonna go a long way
1597714 thornton didnt let us ask if he was all right to pitch that last inning
1597715 he said im all right i got it it was a total effort by the whole bullpen they stepped up big time
1597716 today we did a great job and gave a chance to our team to come back like we did
1597717 i can count probably four other times that its been like this going back to seattle
1597718 500 600 home runs things like that and probably cincinnati the first time
1597719 a little bit of everything in the first four days but im glad im here
1597720 you gotta go up to home plate and look for my pitch
1597721 were not scrapping for first place but i think playing in these kinds of game in this atmosphere guys who havent been in that atmosphere before its intense
1597722 guys are into it and doing everything they can to win a ballgame they are agonizing over any failures during the game but its a great atmosphere for these guys to be in and as long as they keep playing that way and creating that type of atmosphere were going to make strides
1597723 its a daily grind this game hitting every day its a grind every day
1597724 its a battle and you just gotta go up there try to compete try to put on quality at bats no matter whats going on balls are finding holes and its working out right and ill try to keep that going
1597725 he has driven the ball to second base hard several times he hit a ball to center field the other night just crushed it and the center fielder went to the top of the wall to get it he really is locked in
1597726 i kept us in the ballgame i put up a quality start
1597727 sure id like to win the game but we won the game and weve won three in a row its kind of fun it brings a little bit of energy into the clubhouse
1597728 in order to restore the broken down disciplinary mechanism which sustained the police over the years the commission has decided to cancel the promotion of 140 officers whose promotion breached the established criteria
1597729 accordingly all the affected should revert to their former ranks with immediate effect thereafter all those who qualified and meet the established criteria will be considered for promotion on merit subject to available vacancies and recommendation of the inspector general of police
1597730 the commission observed that because the mechanism for the transparent performance of the statutory duties of the psc and inspector general of police appeared to have broken down totally at the time issues of appointment promotion discipline and appeals were unduly influenced from outside and within the force
1597731 it smacks of victimisation or attempt to bring down ribadu at all cost
1597732 its like the practice in chinese tradition of having all parts of the world come to pay tribute
1597733 the olympics also lets your own people know that the rest of the world confers legitimacy on and supports the government
1597734 knowing that the chinese would take stock of those decisions very few statesmen could avoid showing up
1597735 the chinese leadership has signaled that coming earns points for the countries concerned

1597738 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law

1597786 i admit that there is some delay in spending the money on the projects in the provinces and in the ministries
1597787 we have problems in this issue because there are lots of obstacles we face because of the situation that were going through were trying to deal with that were trying to improve things but you know the situation in iraq
1597788 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1597789 irremediably in violation of international law and breaks our treaty promises
1597790 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1597791 i definitely wish i was never singled out i came up there to do a story thats all i wanted to do is write a story
1597792 we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1597793 makes in 30 seconds what the typical ohio worker makes in a year
1597794 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work
1597795 sen obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1597796 its blatantly discriminatory to single out people with hiv its stupid and ridiculous
1597797 these restrictions are really impeding our ability to control hiv and aids
1597798 they had some type of smoke or odor in the cabin
1597799 on a superficial level the bush administration leaves the u s on better terms in asia than in other regions
1597800 but at a deeper level theres been a hollowing out of our capabilities and a deteriorating of our strengths that will require full attention at home
1597801 will reduce our attraction in such a dynamic region as asia
1597802 if you dont have a good working relationship with the chinese government how do you do that
1597803 are a good news story because it shows the vibrancy of korean democracy
1597804 we are less well positioned to go forward in asia than we should be
1597805 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter is absurd
1597806 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1597807 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and took her
1597808 where is the man responsible for this where is the director of electricity ill track him down
1597809 we dont push too hard against the taliban or the government
1597810 we say general things to avoid trouble security is not good electricity is not good people are moving away from kandahar the municipality does nothing about the garbage in the streets but we dont say anything about specific leaders
1597811 why arent you building factories to employ our young people
1597812 if we make factories for young people who will fight how will i get my money from foreign governments
1597813 everything is more expensive now even spoiled pakistani fruit is selling for high prices the ngos try to help by giving us wheat but people steal it and smuggle it out of the country
1597814 he always covered his sorrow with a smile and his pain with a joke
1597815 i decided to make myself famous and get some money
1597816 security was better in the taliban times but everybody was afraid
1597817 we can only hope that the u s president elected this november will listen conscientiously to the majority
1597818 we have already recalled the product and we dont produce it anymore
1597819 there was a lot of faith involved the faith of my mother the faith of my friends and my own faith
1597820 sometimes that was all there was to hang onto unfortunately it took 25 years to come into play
1597821 the fact that he fired it was pretty unbelievable that no one was hurt
1597822 if you dont come with me bad things are going to happen
1597823 yes i took her and as long as you play by my rules she will come back unharmed and breathing however failure to abide by the rules will result in a bullet put in her head my rules do nothing sit there in silence and suffer
1597824 his name will forever be associated with this companys fuel cell products which are being deployed as an energy source for applications in a growing number of important global markets
1597825 based on the context of the entire label we agree that the phrase in question refers to the brand name of the product and does not mislead consumers
1597826 dr hayne has dedicated many many years of his life to ensure that autopsies that were required by the state of mississippi were done
1597827 the commissioner made it very clear that dr hayne had done an excellent job
1597828 a close scrutiny of that which is being alleged has been proven to be totally false
1597829 we always ask our children when anyone and everyone is coming to visit because it is their home the only home they have and they heartily agreed
1597830 the children see him as a kind uncle coming to visit not in his official position
1597831 there are geniuses poets artists and physicians among the kids who call mercy their home and yet they are labeled as klong toey children and not the children who are worthy of proper education and jobs
1597832 the visit of mr uncle president is telling them they are of great value and not to believe any of the bad stuff people might say
1597833 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in
1597834 are people actually doing it i really find it hard to believe
1597835 gives you time to make arrangements and take care of your personal matters
1597836 it is a way for you to plan your return home
1597837 we understand the impact it has on them when we knock on their doors early in the morning and take them out of their homes
1597838 they dont want their children to go through the trauma of being arrested in the morning
1597839 noted by ice as a factor in your immigration records
1597840 for anyone to say no one will do it thats absolutely wrong
1597841 weve done this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record on tibet
1597842 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations
1597843 its absolutely critical that a message is sent to the chinese government to meaningfully address and end violence and repression in tibet or they will never be truly accepted by the international community
1597844 use the platform of the olympic games to draw attention to their causes
1597845 the ioc are confident beijing city authorities will assess the situation reasonably and act with tact and understanding
1597846 its like the practice in chinese tradition of having all parts of the world come to pay tribute
1597847 the olympics also lets your own people know that the rest of the world confers legitimacy on and supports the government
1597848 knowing that the chinese would take stock of those decisions very few statesmen could avoid showing up
1597849 the chinese leadership has signaled that coming earns points for the countries concerned
1597850 i ask you therefore will you love her honor and keep her and be faithful to her so long as you both shall live
1597851 i bring the adventurous side out of darren he used to be scared of heights
1597852 we are a bit crazy together so we wanted something that suited
1597853 it is the clear sentiment of this board that more can and should be done to safeguard human life than has been the case to this point in the construction process
1597854 we believe these kind of measures just provide a false sense of security
1597855 the canal should not appear like a swimming pool that people can jump and swim across easily
1597856 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1597857 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1597858 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal
1597859 in the battle of ideas with the gun lobby were at a constant disadvantage because were honest
1597860 women would throw him kisses and hed come up to the window and press his lips on it he interacted with the people
1597861 its a story of turning around the zoo and turning around the life of a very lonely animal
1597862 his name was really a household word for 30 years or more
1597863 i think china is a hard country to persuade but i do think if there were carrots and sticks involved it might be possible to change their policy towards sudan
1597864 the supplier of last resort for dictators and human rights abusers
1597865 mom dont you understand how important this is to me
1597866 it is harrowing to hear a child saying that if it was madeleine it was a disgrace that it was not passed on
1597867 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know was followed up properly by the police if that hasnt been done it is the kind of information the private investigators are going to follow up
1597868 she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1597869 i asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me i even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say i told her i thought she was cute and asked if she wanted a balloon she didnt i thought it a odd then i heard the woman call the girl she didnt call her maddy but a longer name she could have said madeleine but i dont remember that
1597870 he was a great man one of the few honest people of those times
1597871 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repressions
1597872 by his works and his entire life he innoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1597873 at this point it seems to be more personal than professional
1597874 this is a case based on drug dealers who want to avoid going to jail
1597875 you have the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa florida
1597876 theyre old crimes but the defense he used the last time that he resigned from the mob doesnt work in this case theres no statute of limitations on murder
1597877 we think there is a real gap in the marketplace here in portland and in oregon in general
1597878 oregon will be what seattle went through in the 99 to 2003 time period
1597879 just like those great pinot noirs down in the willamette valley
1597880 we are aware of reports of two british nationals being detained near the national stadium in beijing
1597881 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1597882 ill probably get detained by the police and then ejected out of the country but i believe its not anywhere near the risk or the fear that tibetans are living under the occupation of the chinese government
1597883 for years the chinese government has tried to use the olympics to legitimise its illegal occupation of tibet
1597884 at this very moment tibetans are facing the most severe and violent repression they have seen in decades at the hands of the chinese government and we have taken non violent action at this critical time to draw the worlds attention to the crisis gripping tibet
1597885 it is a miracle for me because i was able to smile again laugh again and just feel alive again
1597886 as of today we are at the stage of receiving orders from anywhere in the world
1597887 i had to make sacrifices and i dream of the day some day when everyone can afford to clone their pet because losing a pet is a terrible terrible loss to anyone
1597888 i said get in the car buddy youre going home we forged a fast friendship
1597889 little did i know that 30 days later this dog was going to save my life
1597890 and he told me with his eyes dont be sad because i am going to see you again
1597891 rnl has no right to offer this service and is practising black market cloning
1597892 nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in ledgers home or his body
1597893 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1597894 heath was a friend his death is a tragic loss my thoughts are with his family
1597895 everyone has been very eager to help saying what a great guy heath ledger was everyone except mary kate who has refused to speak
1597896 the critical issue for us was how can we modernize the classrooms without increasing the tax rate
1597897 i am concerned that the district will not be able to meet its educational needs without modernization the classroom overcrowding is not good
1597898 to ask our voters to carry our share when our history is what it is is not fair
1597899 we havent been transparent or accountable to the voters who will carry this until 2058 i cant vote for that
1597900 the actual scope of all of this will be defined after the bond has been passed when we will go from a broad brush picture to specifics
1597901 we wont get the improvements we need without this this is the next route since we are cash strapped it makes sense to do it
1597902 im afraid im going to have nightmares and im going to get stuck there
1597903 when animals are exposed to a severe threat the basic adaptation is to wake up more frequently
1597904 i gave up my tranquillity as many of the other warriors did so the rest of america can have theirs
1597905 it got to the point where we had to choose between bathing ourselves and sleep between sleeping or eating
1597906 it basically sticks me in an eight hour nightmare fest so thats not a solution for me
1597907 sleep problems are one of the most difficult symptoms of ptsd to treat
1597908 its not uncommon for veteran patients to have 20 30 years of difficulty sleeping
1597909 wed party until 2 a m stay up until 4 and then get up for reveille at 5 30
1597910 we were in the barracks staring at the wall because we couldnt sleep
1597911 the repeating sequence is always about particular people killed in front of me in my squad
1597912 its just as troubling in the dream as when it happened in reality
1597913 nonetheless the imprinting just becomes too much you have to get up and take a look
1597914 i think there might be some tranquillity waiting for me
1597915 im up there with my buddy i pull him out of the humvee the medevac helicopter is on top of a hill im carrying him he keeps getting heavier and heavier and sinking into the ground and i drag him gravity is increasing i cant get him to the chopper
1597916 really taken a load off my shoulders to know im not the only one
1597917 im almost at the point where id be willing to give a body part for one good nights sleep no nightmares the type of sleep where you wake up feeling renewed
1597918 the youths of that community have experienced absolute horrors we want to create a center to give these youths the opportunity were afforded
1597919 kebijakan kami dari awal adalah memperlihatkan gambar gambar yang kami peroleh dan mencoba melibatkan dunia bersama dengan kami untuk mengeksplorasi mars untuk suatu daerah yang bisa dihuni
1597920 kami sungguh sungguh merasa sudah waktunya setiap orang tahu apa yang kami temukan dan membuka jendela bagi dunia
1597921 gedung putih telah diingatkan oleh nasa tentang rencana sebuah pengumuman yang akan dikeluarkan segera mengenai temuan pendarat phoenix yang terkait dengan potensi untuk kehidupan di mars
1597922 di bumi terdapat banyak tumbuhan yang bisa mengkonsentrasi perkhlorat dan hidup dalam perkhlorat pada tingkat tertentu terdapat berbagai spesies bakteria yang menggunakan perkhlorat sebagai substrat dalam metabolisme meeka
1597923 perkhlorat akan menginformasikan kepada kita tentang sejarah air di mars bukan hanya di lokasi pendaratan phoenix tetapi di bagian bagian lain di mars seraya kami meneruskan eksplorasi kami
1597924 sekarang kami telah melihat perkhlorat di permukaan dan garis penelitian selanjutnya adalah melihat di mana lagi mereka berada dan apakah mobilitas air atau garam terlibat dalam perpindahan itu
1597925 now that the olympic games are finally upon us its a chance to show how tibetans feel and what their hopes are
1597926 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1597927 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
1597928 i had quite an experience with it i tell you
1597929 i was going along and it got kind of warm so i took my jacket off and carried it over my arm
1597930 this huge bird come at me on the road and made a rush at me
1597931 at least two feet high and it was wide the only thing that saved me from not getting tangled up was i kept hitting it with my jacket
1597932 if he would have put his claws down he would have struck the top of my head i just stopped it scared me so
1597933 that is the only thing i could possibly think of that size
1597934 i dont really want to unless i know its gone
1597935 my job is really going to be helping them fundraise helping them perhaps getting their name on the map
1597936 i never felt i made a mistake because as an only child i was helping my mom
1597937 i prayed i wouldnt fall i had my hands in the proper position to shake hands and receive the certificate and my heart was beating very rapidly when i was on my way home i said to my mom who passed away in 1999 this is for you mom it took longer than i thought it would but i accomplished it i started crying i knew she was there beside me
1597938 when i was in school at humber park and graham creighton our courses made no mention of black people
1597939 maybe during black history month wed learn about martin luther king but i didnt know any black history i learned about slavery by reading alex haleys novel roots my parents julia and keith carvery talked of the good and bad times of their childhood but not the history of our people
1597940 i kept thinking im going to be stupid because i dont know anything
1597941 i even thought id be the oldest but there was one woman 71 and a girl 19 after the first month i surprised myself that i could do well
1597942 the assistant manager was from new brunswick and when he found out i was from nova scotia he hired me on the spot
1597943 after working in too many call centres i reflected on my life and got tired of dead end jobs doing the same thing every day i wanted to show my kids i could do better
1597944 when i came to nscc to talk about becoming a flight attendant i was asked if i had grade 12
1597945 i had to say no the african canadian program was suggested and when i met jill and student services adviser gail wilson i was sold i passed an assessment exam was interviewed and got accepted i truly jumped up and down with joy
1597946 she excelled 86 2 average herself but was willing to take everyone in the class with her by helping them with their work its a beautiful trait to see in a world where we get so caught up in ourselves
1597947 the centerpiece to an outdoor kitchen is the fire the fire is typically a bbq grill of some stripe but this addition is not just a grill otherwise most everyone already has one
1597948 take out no more than 4 to 5 percent of your nest egg per year
1597949 nach der gewinnwarnung vor ein paar tagen sind die blanken zahlen ok
1597950 wir sind sowohl f r weiteres organisches als auch f r externes wachstum gut aufgestellt

1597952 alles in allem ist die finanzkrise noch nicht zum stillstand gekommen und wird auch das zweite halbjahr 2008 beeintr chtigen
1597953 when she knew or ought to have known he was not capable of the proper and safe operation thereof
1597954 in atlantic canada a high percentage of the population heat their homes with heating fuel which will be more heavily taxed and using electricity much of it from coal fired plants
1597955 people in atlantic canada are going to get hammered hard under the liberal proposal and thats one of the reasons why voters in mr thibaults riding understand what hes talking about
1597956 if you remember you said it in 2006 you said it in 2004 and your predecessor said it in 2000
1597957 if they have me in their sights they keep missing
1597958 if you look at the numbers of where it was last time it would be the logical place that you would attack first but they havent been able to get a credible candidate
1597959 if they wanted to take me out i would think youd get someone whos looking forward to building a political career not somebody whos at the age where hes considering retirement youre not building for the future here this is a candidate whos lost provincially lost federally and is what 62 63 years old
1597960 its always interesting when somebody turns personal maybe hes paying more attention this time i think there are a lot of people who would not consider 60 old i think experience and knowledge are a positive thing im prepared to let the public make that choice
1597961 since atlantic canadians mostly rely on coal for electricity oil to heat their homes and diesel to import food and other items the permanent new liberal carbon tax will be devastating for the region
1597962 its no wonder liberals are spending two days in digby trying to find ways to fool atlantic canadians about it we wont let that happen
1597963 mr mackay is either lying or hes completely incompetent neither of which is acceptable as nova scotias regional minister
1597964 he signed off on that press release so it becomes his if he did it without reading it hes incompetent if he did read it then he lied to you guys
1597965 the minister had authorized the overall idea of going on the attack against the liberals and endorsed his attack on the green shift tax and he wasnt told that the press releases context included the fact that the liberals were meeting
1597966 the joggins fossil centre is a perfect example of what needs to be done to move nova scotia toward a more environmentally friendly and economically sustainable future
1597967 we would also reduce co2 emissions by about 440 000 tonnes over those 20 years that would be the equivalent of taking 4 434 cars off the road each year
1597968 we didnt see anything that looked like red algae but the concentrations were certainly very high
1597969 the expert who can actually make the identification using microscopic examination is unavailable
1597970 so we wont be able to provide a definitive identification of the organism yet
1597971 this jet goes all the way straight up and will pull three gs on takeoff
1597972 this jet is where the phrase the jet set came from
1597973 this is the corvette of the aviation world or the model t
1597974 people come to see it because it is just a terrific aircraft well designed and well built and its a real novelty
1597975 you remember the rat pack with frank sinatra and dean martin
1597976 well this is the kind of jet they would have used and let me tell you this jet is fitted out
1597977 no one rich and famous used this but it is one of only a few of its kind still in the air and its all original
1597978 most of these jets ended up in museums in fact the second one built has been in the smithsonian for awhile
1597979 this plane has a lot of critical areas and it can be a very challenging plane to fly
1597980 oh no it doesnt forgive pilot errors and of the 104 learjet 23s built more than half of them have had accidents over the years
1597981 you dont even want to think about the cost its just obscene
1597982 her efforts in capacity and community building and her work with women and youth in our party make her a natural choice for our members
1597983 and i laugh i have more faith in the voters that theyll see the difference
1597984 i remember going door to door in central nova and someone coming to the door and saying alexa you look
1597985 alexa has fought so many battles particularly for women and i feel that im able to ride that wave in a way in the sense that as a young woman i feel very honoured and privileged that a young woman can run for federal office
1597986 im sure she will be an equally compelling and convincing candidate here in what is far more trodden territory for ndp candidates
1597987 voters are a lot more sophisticated than some people give them credit for
1597988 there are many many ways in which we are very different starting with my being a whole generation older shes younger than my kids
1597989 nach der gewinnwarnung vor ein paar tagen sind die blanken zahlen o k
1597990 you cant sit on a lead and run a few plays into the line and just kill the clock youve got to throw the ball over the damn plate and give the other man his chance thats why baseball is the greatest game of them all
1597991 independence speaks to autonomy in the development of a people and a nation in terms of how we manage our affairs
1597992 it is the point in our cultural evolution when we must be cohesive as a nation that in reflecting on our past make decisions on what we have yet to accomplish as a nation
1597993 the people need to focus on the power that we have as individuals but we need to do so from a point of law and order and not from a point of anarchy
1597994 we cannot allow the rest of the world to define us we need to teach our children to be proud of who we are instead of the self hatred that we see out there today until we do that were not going anywhere fast
1597995 the athletes on the relay squads were invited to training and all turned up except for the mvp athletes

1598000 we have great chances for the 4x100 both for women and men once they keep the baton in hand two hundred metres usain bolt gone wid it 100 metres wi can get gold and silver usain or asafa it nuh really matter
1598001 so the cease and desist order was anticipated a long time ago and it is in fact in keeping with what world wise partners had been doing two months ago
1598002 an application doesnt mean they can or any other entity connected to them can offer securities to the public
1598003 i went through two weeks of intense training from breezes montego bay to margaritaville each day doing between six to eight laps which amount to more than a mile
1598004 right now the minister audley shaw is dangling the carrot but after the minister comes the stick
1598005 we are going to take everything you have of worth for the taxes and if that is not sufficient well take the body to court
1598006 there will be some differences in philosophies of throwing the football than we had in the past both in the number and type of throws
1598007 jorge munoz has brought some tremendous ideas in here were going to get a chance to bring some pretty innovative things to the table
1598008 were just going to throw the ball as much as we can to let defenses know that were not just a running team
1598009 former offensive coordinator blake anderson called the plays but ron always gave his input on what we did
1598010 hes finished everything now its just waiting for it to get recorded
1598011 were going to get his academic stuff cleared up before we let him practice im hoping this is cleared up after tuesday
1598012 todays a work day thats why we put the pads on
1598013 for the company to select an individual or a group of individuals that have contributed to the technological innovation of the entire company is really amazing
1598014 it gives you a very unique almost microscopic view of the world
1598015 we are truly proud of morgans accomplishments and his contributions to the global success of fugro
1598016 morgans leadership in the development of fli map has allowed fugro to make major technological advancements in the field of airborne mapping
1598017 i only have one client and if the school board gives me what i asked for then my case is moot
1598018 the school board should make sure that all bus stops have a cop or someone designated to watch the children before the bus arrives and also in the afternoon making sure they are all safe
1598019 how can anyone in the lafayette public school system agree to these times and actually think that they have the childrens safety and best interest in mind
1598020 it was just that everything at one time hit me hard
1598021 and it was hard for me to get out of the hole
1598022 it was my first summer since i can remember not playing baseball
1598023 i was probably 6 years old the last time i didnt play baseball it was different i kind of enjoyed the free time i was just sitting back and relaxing but then i see my team and im supposed to be out there playing with them so it goes both ways all i could do was cheer my teammates on id call them after the game leon landry and jared i called them and wished them good luck i watched every game
1598024 i was just thinking of how it used to be in high school at st augustine in new orleans and then southern lab in baton rouge after hurricane katrina because i just know this is my spot this is my spot easy but i get out there and im like all right he can throw pretty good oh he can hit too oh he can hit too so it was just battling it out for the position thats why lsu is pretty high up there
1598025 it wasnt so much the football and baseball it was the school part if you dont do any one of those three well it knocks everything out of the water he just didnt apply himself in school i think the kid is an excellent talent but its tough hopefully hell be able to do better academically and balance things and help us next season

1598091 de vzw beschikte niet over de middelen om de schetsen van de architect goed te keuren en het licht op groen te zetten voor een voorontwerp dat is nu gebeurd eind december begin janua ri hopen we ons dossier in te dienen bij de verschillende overheden om de nodige vergunningen te krijgen een groot probleem in brussel is dat een bouwvergunning makkelijk een jaar op zich laat wachten de echte renovatie kan dan in de loop van 2010 beginnen ons plan om in twee fases te renoveren laten we vallen daar is geen tijd meer voor alles ook de vierde zaal en extra ingang zal in n keer gebeuren de renovatie zal minstens een jaar in beslag nemen le palace zal dus openen in 2011 of zoiets

1598100 i just think that overall you get to this stage of your career you want to do better on third down and id like to finish off some of those close sacks instead of making them pressures trying to find a way to finish
1598101 third and 8 they drop back i think those are the opportunities when we have to put the pressure on
1598102 you cant always blitz it cant always be six guys so its going to be up to the guys up front to be able to rush four guys and get some pressure
1598103 i think they are just a good group of guys theyre fun to be around in the meetings and i think they put football first
1598104 they are young and energetic they enjoy playing football and they think that we can offer them some kind of advice i think the older guys get a kick out of it because they ask us stuff and we try to help them because those are the guys well be playing with all year
1598105 i think guys can appreciate players like tedy bruschi and rodney harrison and guys like that who come out here and have fun coming playing football

1598121 the power of thoughts is real and we must learn to use it positively the future holds the promise of our destiny we can have a foretaste of it and live in its reality in advance by projecting an image of it in our imagination positive thinking by the means of imagination becomes an effective exercise capable of transforming our entire life

1598216 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool

1598218 have already contributed more to halvorson than ive raised in my total campaign
1598219 i think this is a win win for the democrats
1598220 the two that are going to go forward are jon halvorson and sandra romero and we support them both
1598221 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1598222 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1598223 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1598224 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
1598225 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1598226 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1598227 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
1598228 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
1598229 we were on the 15th floor the lamps were swaying and we felt a bit dizzy
1598230 from a scientific perspective green carbon accounting and protection of the natural forests in all nations should become part of a comprehensive approach to solving the climate change problem
1598231 protecting the carbon in australias and the worlds natural forests is no longer an option it is a necessity
1598232 if natural forests continue to be cleared and degraded then the carbon dioxide released will significantly increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
1598233 to date in climate change discussions in the forest sector all the attention has been on reforestation and afforestation
1598234 at the bali climate change conference in december everybody kind of woke up and realised that natural forests store a vast amount of carbon and that we cant afford to allow further emissions from deforestation and forest degeneration because these are on top of fossil fuel burning
1598235 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
1598236 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
1598237 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
1598238 the late paleozoic tropical climate was not buffered against cold from the high latitudes as everyone had thought
1598239 the evidence we found indicates that glaciers were common at this time even in tropical latitudes this calls into question traditional assumptions of long lasting equatorial warmth in the late paleozoic and raises the possibility of large scale and unexpected climate change in the tropics during that time

1598249 there are a lot of organs up there it could be a stomach thing a pancreas thing or even a liver or gallbladder thing
1598250 like a thing or a brace yourself and call your momma thing
1598251 well there shouldnt be any reason to panic just yet
1598252 were going to run some extensive tests to rule out things like hepatitis
1598253 no no hopefully it has something to do with acid or something but given your symptoms and the tenderness i feel in your upper stomach its best to look into all of the worst case causes first
1598254 im sorry what i believe i stopped listening somewhere after hepatitis
1598255 try not to think about it for the rest of the evening well send this off to the lab immediately and hopefully ill have some results for you tomorrow
1598256 try not to think about it for the rest of the evening
1598257 im sort of hunched over as i type this ouch
1598258 a new online teaching learning and business network that will forever change the profession and business of teaching
1598259 fostering collaboration between language learners and groups trying to preserve languages
1598260 staff seemed to desire elearning experiences that surpassed those they currently offered to their students
1598261 good luck im not in the tito ortiz business anymore
1598262 i believed that preserved soft tissues had been found but i had to change my opinion
1598263 you have to go where the science leads and the science leads me to believe that this is bacterial biofilm
1598264 if you could dissolve the bucket away youd find soft squishy material in the shape of the bucket and thats the slime
1598265 the same is true for dinosaur bones if you dissolve away the bone whats left is biofilm in the shape of vascular canals
1598266 we determined that these structures were too common to be exceptionally preserved tissue we realized it couldnt be a one time exceptional preservation
1598267 from this evidence we could determine that what had previously been reported as dinosaurian soft tissues were in fact biofilms or slime
1598268 this was the first time that we were ever able to tag these animals around realistic military exercises
1598269 currently there is no impact to production and no personnel have been evacuated
1598270 the beijing environment exchange will fully play its role as a market platform bringing together domestic and foreign companies agencies banks and investment banks
1598271 everything i do has a spiritual tone to it but i hope that it can also relate to people in everyday life i had a girl come up to me once who told me that i saved her life because she had cancer and listened to my cd during chemotherapy ive had a woman come up to me who just had a baby but didnt have a husband and she was worried about how she was going to make it but shed play alright and it made her feel better think of you is the first song i ever wrote about god but the irony is it can work as both an r amp b love song and a spiritual song in concert people leave crying because they always feel something spiritual from the experience everybody tells me its like church when we go to see you and they tell me they feel renewed and inspired when they leave im just being who i am but everything has to have god in it for me to do it
1598272 i watched my mom perform and thats how i started doing it were from new orleans louisiana and she had a band there thats pretty much how i got the buzz listening around the house to her and her band and different records but not really starting out in church just being a hippie i had a casio keyboard i wrote a song off that little beat on the casio in the 80s when i was little thats how i began songwriting and on my piano we always had a grand piano and some drums in the house a full set of drums and a bass amp with a bass so that was the beginning of the song writing my first song was i need you i was really little my mom was like why you write these big songs i would mimic opera singers on the radio those were my favourites
1598273 i was performing around the bay area at pretty much everywhere there is to sing nightclubs theatres churches i was writing with other artists in the area like my good friend sundra manning who asked why dont you finally do a record yourself so i got money together paid for studio time and decided to make the soulsinger record in 2000 before i put it out i went to a few labels and got some really nice rejection letters it was before the whole jill scott neo soul movement so we decided to put it out ourselves and the buzz started to get bigger it was big already in the bay area but then the record started to get word of mouth attention then we did feeling orange but sometimes blue in 2003 which was a mix of jazz and r amp b as an independent every dime you make gets put back into making music again so i wasnt making any money and i was nearly homeless unsure whether i should continue in the business it seemed like i was popular enough to be popular but not enough to get to the next level looking back i think it had to do with some self esteem issues and not getting my spiritual base back in alignment
1598274 during that time i believed more in people than god and myself i trusted people to take care of everything for me and what i learned was not everyone believes the same dream that you have for yourself so i felt abandoned and alone until verve came along at that point i had to buckle down and pray am i making the right decision god and sure enough it was the best decision ive made from then on ive always prayed am i on the right path lord thats how it is for me everything has to work through my faith if its not spiritually correct then i wont do it before i was blaming everybody else when i really needed to look at myself really buckle down and wrestle with issues of self i was told i wasnt skinny or pretty enough that i had a great voice but had to lose some pounds when you hear that enough times and it has nothing to do with music you get tired so learning to love myself was a big issue and im finally in the mode of not worrying about what others think anymore in this business everyone analyzes every part of you your thoughts your spirituality your music the restaurants you go to the cars you drive who youre dating thats why you have to have pillars in your life like loving parents and faith in god
1598275 i recorded my sensitivity and i started to be heard because radio stations could finally play me since the song came from a major label it gave me a lot of popularity though i still didnt know if i should stay in the business until verve came along
1598276 i had to figure out what kind of record i wanted to make because during that period of time i was again deciding should i stay in the business
1598277 i kept hearing that phrase over and over again in my head i heard it in amazing grace the spiritual song it says i once was lost but now im found i always remember that phrase its one of my favourite spirituals lost amp found had a lot to do with me being lost in my personal life not feeling loved being lost in my spiritual life and being lost musically once i was found i started getting in alignment with god that was my spiritual alignment and then everything started to come personally im happier i feel loved needed wanted and in the business musically i started feeling i can express all of this and its okay you dont have to cover up your craft to make someone else feel happy you dont have to pretend like youre good enough you know youre good enough be good enough you deserve it then finding my father was an instrumental part of the whole thing hes very spiritual and everyone around me is very spiritual i have a big faith thing going on and its really nice from my godparents family to the person who loves me im just happy im very very in alignment with my music im happy finally once you get in alignment with your faith what you are as a person knowing where youre from what youre deserving of and having that strength to say it saying it is one thing being it is another all of that coming together is a powerful thing ive come a long way to say im okay with me
1598278 im pretty much deciding on a church so i can become more active in a community my travel schedule is super tight and i have a big commitment with that but every time im in one place long enough i want to continue going to the same church right now thats just hard with my schedule but i will go as often as i can on the road if its a family church im not really interested in singing in choir but i like listening to pastors that are realists and talk about things that are really going on i went to one church where the pastor held up two plates one was silver and the other was rusty he was saying how we come to church all rusty but we hope to leave clean enough to see gods reflection in the plate i love real examples of faith like that
1598279 sometimes you have to put your money where your mouth is
1598280 when she called us to say she wanted to pay we couldnt believe it arthur was jumping for joy this is like a dream come true
1598281 anyone who is willing to study hard and get an education especially in the sciences ought to have the chance to do so
1598282 i dont want to be one of the people in life where the best thing i did on this earth was die off
1598283 i have told everybody that if they want to spend one weekend or the other in denver go right ahead but dont plan to be there for the convention aug 25 28
1598284 the governor believes everyone is frustrated by the way things stand
1598285 unless theres a budget in the next few days were facing crucial actions the state is going to have to take
1598286 we must reject irresponsible tax increase proposals like raising the sales tax because they will do nothing but hurt families kill jobs and delay our economic recovery
1598287 the only proposal democrats are willing to discuss is one that includes tax increases
1598288 this economy will not survive more taxes it is a nonstarter for us
1598289 unless he can get republicans to agree with his point of view we could be here for an extended period of time
1598290 i dont think we can get a budget this year without budget reform
1598291 have a huge list of ems but they have not brought anything up
1598292 they never once proposed any alternative to the democratic budget so the burden is really now on them if they want to let the great state of california slide into arkansas thats going to be on them
1598293 we will file a lawsuit to compel the controller to comply
1598294 there are some four billion of these plastic bags floating around the place getting into landfill ending up affecting our wildlife and showing up on our beaches while we are on holidays
1598295 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time
1598296 and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1598297 yes i am swollen and i am going to gain weight in a city where if youre not a minus size 0 you are fat
1598298 we are very excited to have david and andrew perform the anthem for our first regular season game of the 2008 season
1598299 the citizens of kansas city are proud to call david one of our own and we are very happy for all of the well deserved success he has achieved we know our fans will give both david and andrew a very warm reception on september 14th
1598300 we stuck with that with both kids good irish and good biblical names were just blessed to have such a beautiful family

1598304 all the kids wanna know how the judges are in real life and what it was like being on the show and what has my life been like after the show
1598305 theyre only 10 to 15 and they get up at the drop of a dime
1598306 idol kids run up screaming and smiling and waving to the camera like they are camera hungry theyre just loving it
1598307 any time im like hey girls you wanna smile at least seven more pile in the picture

1598311 she gave me her credit card and license and i said you must get teased a lot because you look like kelly clarkson
1598312 my wife is a big american idol fan and she was always our favorite
1598313 i always said it would take a certain someone to buy these paintings and its nice it was a local artist
1598314 i said you do know one is 1 400 and the other is 1 600
1598315 she said she would take them both and asked if i would mail them to her
1598316 she was my second and it was a big sale
1598317 i said it was nice to meet you and i hope you come back to newburyport soon
1598318 then she left her gold card so i had to run down the street and chase her to give it back
1598319 you never know who is going to pop up downtown
1598320 she flew under the radar and we heard about it the next day thats the thing about newburyport you can get so lost in the beauty and magic of it that youre not looking for celebrities like you would be in boston
1598321 brigitte is at a trade show in new york and was freaking out and screaming
1598322 hollywood rock club threatened by developers which serves as the backdrop for a romance between a wannabe guitar hero and a small town girl
1598323 digital music players and music related phones are by far the most popular consumer electronics devices in recent years
1598324 and while it will take time to further develop new models and strategies the music company continues to be a strong cash generator for sony
1598325 the strategy of bertelsmann is to focus on organic growth and music is for us a shrinking business in shrinking markets
1598326 david knows he needs to have a big radio hit and mileys producers are the closest thing he can get to a guarantee
1598327 what if come january 2009 i realize its all been a case of better the arrogant lulu fancying devil you know
1598328 it should be me taking you out to thank you for the sponsorship last year
1598329 but i dont expect other people to pay for my expensive wine habit
1598330 sure but lets not have a heavy red wine if thats ok with you
1598331 these days i often prefer lighter red wines anyway especially pinot noir so thats fine
1598332 why on earth did you call yourself czechout before you renamed your blog to made in scotland id always assumed that you were a czech guy
1598333 well ive got connections with the czech republic for example one of my old friends from scotland lived there for ages
1598334 actually i thought that youd be over 50 and your personality seems quite frivolous not at all what i expected given your dear gb postings where the advice you give always seems well thought out
1598335 a little gift to thank you for a taking me out tonight and for a lovely evening
1598336 thanks very much mate you didnt have to but its much appreciated
1598337 in spite of my frivolous comment on your blog recently i did think that any present youd get for me would be something like that rather than an all expenses paid rent boy session
1598338 have already contributed more to halvorson than ive raised in my total campaign
1598339 i think this is a win win for the democrats

1598341 under normal circumstances if its raining anywhere the equestrian sport continues
1598342 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1598343 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1598344 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1598345 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1598346 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1598347 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1598348 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1598349 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1598350 we can be sure however that anybody who dopes risks getting caught as the testing will be more frequent and significant than at any other olympic games
1598351 when i saw people try to grab the flame in paris i was so angry
1598352 the olympic games should not be about politics i was so happy and excited to see the torch
1598353 the past is behind us we look forward to the future
1598354 we believe the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg
1598355 it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone
1598356 the seabird deaths the scientists recorded might be just the tip of the iceberg it suggests that around 18 000 seabirds may be killed annually in this fishery alone
1598357 most mortality relates to the dumping of fishing waste behind the boat this attracts seabirds which can either hit the warp lines or become entangled in the nets
1598358 the impact of this one local fishery has very widespread geographical repercussions
1598359 potential mortality at this scale for the albatrosses is unsustainable
1598360 one would hope that further data like these will now become available through appropriate collaborations involving fishery managers
1598361 potential mortality at this scale for the albatrosses is unsustainable

1598366 quotas for women entail that women must constitute a certain number or percentage of the members of a body whether it is a candidate list a parliamentary assembly a committee or a government the quota system places the burden of recruitment not on the individual woman but on those who control the recruitment process
1598367 the office of facilities planning and construction would obviously work with the ut brownsville campus to look at specs for the fence what the costs would be for the fence

1598383 we are very excited about canterbury jack and proud to launch it at the great british beer festival in front of the countrys most discerning audience
1598384 we hope its modern refreshing flavour will appeal to established ale drinkers as well as people discovering ale for the first time
1598385 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1598386 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1598387 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1598388 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1598389 giving the criminal history at this particular point could taint the jury pool
1598390 certainly anyone who has lived on the west side knew her or knew of her
1598391 were just trying to hold our heads up stick together and trust in the lord that hell see us through
1598392 the first thing i look for is the wine has to taste good

1598395 when wineries were making bad wines in michigan they were easy to spot now there are no bad wines
1598396 the michigan competition is really important to us we submit as many as we have on hand
1598397 michigan is a big state for developing ragweed allergies its probably the combination of the climate and the amount of ragweed that is around
1598398 i tell patients that if you live in michigan long enough you have a good chance of developing an allergy

1598406 oh wo is me i have a lump in my boobie
1598407 i pray that one of these days you will be able to let go of your fear and anger from your own difficult experience for the sake of yourself and your children

1598411 i can go out there and be relaxed i got more sleep last night than i probably got in the last five days combined you can go out there and be more you the nervousness was there but i didnt know it
1598412 i just want to get over this rehab stuff and get back on the field
1598413 it was a real weird injury the mri came back clean but i still wasnt able to throw all that well i dont think i took enough time off at first and tried to get back as soon as possible i never hurt my arm before so i didnt know how it was going to feel
1598414 if i had known they were going to shoot my son i would have handled the situation myself
1598415 i called police because i wanted them to help my son not kill him
1598416 he had a small steak knife maybe four inches with the tip broken off
1598417 i need help with my 24 year old son who is flipping out
1598418 he has those blank kind of eyes thats not really him he is very very angry hes not going to be pleasant i dont think
1598419 he is just going to shoot him in the arm right
1598420 i saw him walking toward them slowly just trying to get around them i have compassion for the officer if he was scared but there had to be another option other than shooting to kill my son
1598421 why couldnt he shoot him in the leg or arm or even take him to the ground
1598422 the only way i will drop the knife is in your neck
1598423 felt an abnormaly strong connection with my spiritual sense of being
1598424 we recognize that for the past three years these people have been living in unsteady water
1598425 they couldnt put money into their properties they didnt know what was going to happen we need to do something to relieve the anxiety of owners in that specific area so they dont have to live with the fear that they could possibly lose their house through eminent domain
1598426 one thing led to another and thats when mrs osteen assaulted continental flight attendant sharon brown
1598427 she threw her against the lavatory door and she elbowed her in her breast
1598428 the flight attendant went bonkers she flipped out acted rashly and now wants to be paid for it
1598429 and they left on their own law enforcement was never involved
1598430 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1598431 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1598432 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting
1598433 im very pleased that gloucestershires results are so good a real testament to the hard work of pupils and the help given by teachers parents and carers its a shame that the government got into such a muddle on the marking which has only added to the anxiety for all concerned
1598434 until we have complete figures it is too early to give an overall picture on how our schools have done we think it is unfortunate that the marking has been conducted in this way
1598435 we have a significantly improving picture but there is still much to do to catch up with comparable cities
1598436 despite the well publicised problems with the marking of the tests over 90 per cent of the scripts for pupils in wiltshire have been assessed the results show an above average performance overall this very pleasing performance reflects the hard work of children and staff in schools along with excellent support from parents
1598437 it is disappointing that the government has published results that have yet to be verified by schools
1598438 oh my god i mean it is ridiculous anytime you do anything bigger than yourself theres a little bit of anxiety and excitement
1598439 in 1998 after graduating from college i biked across country and this is the 10 year reunion on aug 2 to completing that so the idea surfaced as an offspring to that

1598454 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1598455 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1598456 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1598457 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1598458 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1598459 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1598460 we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death

1598464 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1598465 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing

1598468 j m johnson j concurring today we are confronted with an example of abusive prosecution by several local governments san juan county and the cities of seattle auburn and kent hereinafter municipalities determined to file a legal action ostensibly for disclosure of radio time spent discussing a proposed initiative this litigation was actually for the purpose of restricting or silencing political opponents and was quickly dismissed after the filing deadline for the initiative the disregard for core freedoms of speech and association in this case and resulting interference with these constitutional rights is described in the majority granting nngt complete reasonable attorney fees and trial costs is appropriate and required here this may serve to deter future state actors from using their authority to act similarly to deprive individuals of constitutional rights of speech or initiative

1598472 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
1598473 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
1598474 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
1598475 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here
1598476 you do this you do that this reading is over
1598477 reincarnationists do not seem to want to consider the logical explanations for their experiences which are sometimes as little as feeling drawn to a place etc does anyone really consider this their proof of a past life

1598518 forcing county taxpayers to fund the subway to the sea from downtown to the westside extravagance instead of their own regional needs is wrong
1598519 an ill conceived rush job forced through the mta by the city of los angeles
1598520 the way it was done at the mta certainly wasnt in any way a fair process
1598521 it was a nice concocted scheme that went on and every single step of the way they made arrangements of how they were going to get more for one side of town vs the other side
1598522 so you are asking people who have congested highways and a need for public transportation to once again subsidize a project outside their jurisdiction that will not relieve their communities of congestion or provide for their transit needs but will add and enhance congestion in those communities
1598523 the reason we want this on a consolidated ballot is because we dont want to confuse voters
1598524 am i happy the money is going to charters no not at all but sometimes if youre going to help your kids you have to make a compromise here and there
1598525 its a good example of how we can do the right things for kids if we all work together
1598526 the critical issue for us was how can we modernize the classrooms without increasing the tax rate
1598527 i am concerned that the district will not be able to meet its educational needs without modernization the classroom overcrowding is not good
1598528 to ask our voters to carry our share when our history is what it is is not fair
1598529 we havent been transparent or accountable to the voters who will carry this until 2058 i cant vote for that
1598530 the actual scope of all of this will be defined after the bond has been passed when we will go from a broad brush picture to specifics
1598531 we wont get the improvements we need without this this is the next route since we are cash strapped it makes sense to do it
1598532 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1598533 like me the zoning administrator clearly heard the concerns of the surrounding community and made the right decision
1598534 this was just the wrong place for mules to relocate
1598535 were really happy with the decision and we definitely think it was a right decision
1598536 thats the last thing that harbor city needed was to have something like that in our neighborhood
1598537 the overall characterization of the venue that has emerged is of a location that would be closer to becoming and operating with an emphasis on a bar characterization rather than a restaurant
1598538 while that use may be appropriate at another location as proposed it is not the most optimum for this property
1598539 we know there was no actual fire or flames on board so that means we will start looking at mechanical problems that may have caused smoke smells or haze during the flight
1598540 after we found that everyone was ok our biggest concern was accommodating the needs of the passengers and getting them to their destination
1598541 im worried because his mom is really not a stable person mentally
1598542 when she gets nervous and irate she does crazy things
1598543 what we hear is the kids with the parent how bad can it be
1598544 these kids suffer significant harm certainly psychological and emotional harm

1598550 i can say with 100 percent certainty i will be back in pakistan on an 8 000 meter peak next year
1598551 as soon as i knew i would abort my summit you start thinking about starbucks your family and friends and food and your car
1598552 i knew if i kept going i would have frostbite i was too young to do that
1598553 i go into shock and it doesnt quite hit me ive been kept so busy i dont think ive had a lot of time to think about it i turned off the emotion
1598554 i knew there would probably be a very severe accident i had no idea there would be 11
1598555 these kind of things happen and they are so rare
1598556 it is a dangerous thing we are doing but whats life without risk if we all stayed in our comfort zone we wouldnt be living a life
1598557 i told my mom earlier in the expedition i would be happy to get to the shoulder of k2

1598562 im missing los angeles and missing friends and family i am looking forward to getting back to los angeles
1598563 cops c o p s make no mistake about it
1598564 i dont see all of this money going to new hires
1598565 every dime that was spent on this trash fee has resulted in fewer victims lets get that straight one thousand new cops is great but it doesnt mean anything if you dont put them on the crime dots what the hell good is it if we have 1 000 cops and we cant deploy them
1598566 lets be very clear los angeles this is what your increased trash fees are going for theyre going for a safer city
1598567 theyre going for less crime thats why i find it worthwhile to pay more to have my trash picked up
1598568 we have some tremendous detectives out there but it also is the cooperation from the community that is helping us solve these crimes
1598569 consumers are not entitled to reimbursement of the fee when covered products are recycled
1598570 rather the intent of the fee is to reduce or eliminate the costs associated with properly recycling this material when it becomes waste
1598571 weve got no advice theres been no communication from channel seven that theyre intending to pull it
1598572 i would just say though congratulations to channel seven at this point in agreeing to broadcast the advertisement

1598574 the australian government has been very vigorous in raising human rights issues in tibet
1598575 accepts the competence of spanish jurisdiction to investigate the reported events
1598576 we are stunned with joy for the victims and the tibetan people for justice in general and the repercussions it may have in this passive world of political fickleness economic greed and general passivity in front of powerful giants
1598577 denounces the new wave of oppression that began in tibet on 10th march 2008 and just goes to prove that acts of genocide continue to be committed against the tibetan people
1598578 denounces chinas manipulation of the global war against terrorism in its attempt to justify and cover up crimes against humanity committed against the tibetan people
1598579 since we first hosted the original test model of the a380 and one of the first demonstration models last year los angeles has eagerly awaited the a380s entry into commercial service
1598580 we see emirates service as the foundation of the next page of commercial aviation
1598581 the arrival of this magnificent aircraft is a persuasive reminder that the future is very much at hand
1598582 we focused on the comfort of the passengers with lots of space between the seats
1598583 we remain unshakable in our belief that this is the aircraft for the next chapter of aviation
1598584 as we get more of these aircraft and its performance improves and the demand from passengers allows us to build a market we will bring this aircraft into los angeles
1598585 but the most important reason is that no u s airline can afford this expensive plane they just dont have the money to buy them right now
1598586 the domestic airlines that do offer long haul flights seem to be happy with the boeing 777 planes they have in service

1598603 hey you were just talking about the pollution issue according to my understanding china started managing the pollution many years ago the environment turned much better now
1598604 yes i know but which is not good enough they should not open the olympic yet still not good enough
1598605 whats good enough no cars no industry business for at least 3 months
1598606 oh do you think that is possible in any city who did or who will to open an olympic
1598607 anyway no matter what lots of famous athletes wont compete this time because they dont want to get a health risk after a beijing olympic
1598608 they can excuse to compete this time but i dont know how about environment going to be for next olympic city how about their health and scores if they dont care the world award who can change

1598619 with the state in such dire fiscal straits why are you supporting this costly project which according to this writer may end up costing the state and new york city about 2 billion in subsidies and tax breaks
1598620 there is a point that the listener correctly has addressed that if it starts to become too costly a lot of these projects that we were for we might have to change our mind to this point we dont think that we are there with the atlantic yards and continue to try to help them

1598623 this is an important piece of the puzzle as we attempt to determine whether habitable conditions exist for microbes on mars

1598625 this desert is a hyper arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants and is often used by scientists as a matter of fact as a martian analog site
1598626 these compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances in fact there are species of perchlorate producing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant

1598920 we will be directly recruiting about 60 per cent of field staff mainly at the level of police sub inspectors for intelligence gathering through state recruitment board

1598951 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he national media marketing industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
1598952 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a national media marketing industry demonstrate to the general public
1598953 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual national media marketing award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a national media marketing project
1598954 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our national media marketing industry can benefit from this special night
1598955 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects

1598960 de realiteit is dat dit mooie symbool van de hoop doelwit van protest is geworden door de enorme mediabelangstelling is de tocht hier ideaal voor door het herstellen van de oude traditie voorkom je tevens dat dit olympische symbool kapot gaat
1598961 sport gaat altijd boven politiek dat wil niet zeggen dat ik de wereld zwart wit zie de olympische gedachte is er een van verbroedering en daarvoor is nodig dat atleten uit alle landen zonder problemen naar de spelen kunnen reizen

1598976 not really a copy will never be as good as the original people who dont like mythbusters wont like a copy of it and people who do like mythbusters wont like it either
1598977 nah we know what makes mythbusters popular so we can do it again
1598978 what makes mythbusters popular you mean the scrutiny of conventional wisdom the spectacular experiments the interplay of adams child like cheekiness and jamies ultra serious no nonsense approach the schoolyard atmosphere the downright comedic moments mixed with occasional hard science the amazing mix of complimentary personalities

1599000 the first is the screenwriters strike in hollywood which had caused rather a lot of changes at the studios
1599001 some films have had delays and there are fewer big american studio films on the market
1599002 this year there were lots of average films nice but nothing more films which did not evoke a huge interest
1599003 often this is shown through the smallest common denominator the family or what is left of it separated parents prodigal children and marginalised people in a collapsing society
1599004 leave in the freezer for 8 hours boot it up and then try to move the data over
1599005 we want candidates with criminal records to be barred from contesting elections for that the government has to pass a law which has not been done yet there is a need to do a lot more to see that criminals are barred from elections
1599006 i feel it is on the decrease because of certain measures taken by the commission like compulsory filling of affidavits by candidates about their pasts
1599007 in the next general election the electoral rolls itself will have photographs of voters hopefully it will work to eliminate bogus voters
1599008 the time was not ripe for making voting compulsory in india
1599009 the election commission has been doing its job with a great deal of sensitivity and professionalism
1599010 as environmental problems become more evident and affect the lives of ordinary individuals it is vitally important that we can access relevant and timely information on the impact of environmental change
1599011 with eye on earth the eea and microsoft plan to bring complex strands of information together into a single simple to use and easy to understand application so as more data and user findings are posted on the portal we can see how climate change affects the way we live and how the way we live affects the environment
1599012 eye on earth is the first part of a pioneering collaboration between microsoft and the eea and has huge implications both for the people and the environment of europe
1599013 water watch combines microsofts technical experience with european political priorities creating a new tool which will help to preserve the environment and to increase european health and safety we look forward to growing this project and collaborating on many more important european initiatives using the power of software to tackle important challenges we face today including pollution and climate change
1599014 eye on earth delivers the kinds of information that the public can really understand
1599015 using the application people can now find out what is happening on the beach near them or the one they plan to visit on holiday water watch demonstrates how technology can develop our understanding of the world around us and let us make informed choices on the kind of environment we want to live in or visit
1599016 eye on earth is a great example of how technology has the power to help governments business and individuals understand what is happening to our environment
1599017 by combining environmental data with mapping technologies it is possible for people to see where changes are happening eye on earth provides people with information which has historically been difficult to find with this new application people will be more informed and be able to take appropriate actions to help ensure a cleaner environment
1599018 poor quality bathing water is a real risk to everyones health and can prevent us from enjoying our seas and rivers
1599019 for the first time eye on earths water watch not only gives us the ability to know what we are going to find when we get into the water but also provides us with the information we need to demand urgent action from governments businesses and individuals the partnership between the eea and microsoft is giving us the resources to force change and protect our natural environment
1599020 despite the increasing availability of lte and wimax hspa and hspa will still support 54 of wireless broadband users by the end of 2015
1599021 by 2015 there will be twenty times as many customers for cellular broadband services as for wimax
1599022 the vast majority of mnos will not break ranks to wimax but will upgrade to lte resulting in over four times more lte users by the end of 2015
1599023 the first neutrons met all of our technical performance predicitions and creating them is a significant milestone in the life of the facility and in the completion of the project
1599024 the isis second target station builds on the success and expertise we have developed over the past 20 years at isis and allows us to move further into the areas of soft matter advanced materials and bioscience we will be carrying out fundamental research that will shape the technological advances of tomorrow
1599025 this is an incredible technical achievement by our staff and demonstrates how everyone can pull together and enable stfc to deliver massive science projects that underpin the long term future of science and innovation in the uk
1599026 im very proud of every single person who has played a part in getting the isis second target station project through to this very important milestone
1599027 this is tremendous news for the science community both in the uk and much further afield
1599028 the isis second target station will open research into new types of materials that has not been previously possible at isis and we look forward to a world of new science flowing from the new instrument suite
1599029 this is a remarkable achievement by the isis team and adds an exciting new dimension to the capabilities of the european neutron scattering toolkit
1599030 isis is the worlds leading spallation neutron facility and has performed world class outstanding science
1599031 adding the second target station is the next great step for isis to enhance the ability and extend the reputation of neutron sciences world wide
1599032 together with the great scientific environment at isis the skilful design and the mature know how in neutron technology applied on the second target station will open up unexplored areas for pulsed cold neutron experiments isis can stay as the world leader even as more powerful spallation neutron sources such as j parc and the us spallation neutron source come online
1599033 for a country of its size the uk is widely acknowledged to be an extremely effective research performer
1599034 the quality of research undertaken in the uk and reported in journal papers is reflected by the fact the uk leads the other g8 nations uk researchers receive on average two and a half times more citations compared with the usa canada france germany italy japan and russia
1599035 possibly the most relevant finding of the report is that the uk offers the best value for money the uk is ranked top for the number of papers published and cited in relation to r amp d investment the uks output of papers in relation to investment is almost twice that of france germany and america china despite having a growing scientific economy remains relatively unproductive as does the usa ranked 17th and 16th place respectively
1599036 global benchmarks are affected by massive and rapid investment and growth in china and significant research and development in smaller countries such as iran

1599046 as more and more of our customers interact with us online we needed a self service system that provided the levels of support they needed in a professional yet friendly form that avoided the hard sell
1599047 by working with transversal weve been able to introduce ask sarah providing an easy to use approachable way for getting immediate answers to questions whatever your technical ability the benefits for our customers have been impressive weve seen customer satisfaction rise and inbound enquiries drop dramatically since introducing sarah and believe this trend will only continue moving forward
1599048 royal mail is an organisation that touches the lives of everybody in the uk
1599049 this means it needs to provide support and customer service answers to a wide range of users including businesses and consumers of all ages and technical abilities the success of the user friendly ask sarah solution shows how self service can deliver real benefits when integrated into an organisation improving customer service and enabling customers to transact more easily online

1599055 this contract is an extension to the services we already provide to police forces in the uk and were proud to continue providing innovative new solutions to police on the beat customer service is our number one priority and the agreement weve signed with the npia could revolutionise the way police work our mobile information solution fully meets the current requirements of the police service and is available to police forces today
1599056 the artisan radar is a sophisticated world class system which will significantly improve the flow and quality of information to commanders compared with existing technology
1599057 the new radar will replace existing systems on our type23 frigates landing ships hms albion and hms bulwark and the assault helicopter carrier hms ocean as well as on our two new aircraft carriers hms queen elizabeth and hms prince of wales this is a prime example of the type of hi tech equipment that we are investing in to improve the ability of our commanders to operate in the 21st century
1599058 the mrr project will provide the royal navy with a long awaited and unrivalled improvement to its medium range radar capability whilst also delivering enhanced system availability and best value for money to the taxpayer
1599059 the project will be delivered through a firm price contract covering both demonstration manufacture and delivery of the radar systems and the first 10 years of in service support this has been a tight competition and my thanks go to all those in industry and in the mod who have worked so hard to make this happen
1599060 airwave is at the forefront of delivering cutting edge mobile solutions to a full range of public safety organisations across great britain and the ability to expand our offering to rail networks presents an exciting opportunity for us with every project the primary aim is to use technology for the task of improving the safety of britains citizens and we are confident that both deployments will meet this aim admirably improving the travelling experience of commuters
1599061 after arriving at southeastern following a role with the british transport police it was clear that the communication between our railway enforcement officers and the british transport police was less than optimal now being able to communicate on airwaves network allows us to increase both employee and customer safety whilst improving our ability to deal with the small minority of passengers that try and disrupt our train service we are very proud to be the first railway organisation that has been recognised by ofcom for full sharer status as an organisation that provides emergency assistance to the police
1599062 south west trains community officers already have a close working relationship with the btp so i am confident that this deployment will further solidify the relationship and dramatically enhance our integrated approach to joint operations it was encouraging to see the success of southeastern railways project and deploying airwaves network makes complete operational sense to us we anticipate much more flexibility for rail officers communicating between the control centre officers on the beat and the btp

1599067 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1599068 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks nearly half of an eggs protein and many of the other nutrients are found in the yolk so make sure to eat the whole egg for maximum benefits
1599069 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1599070 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1599071 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1599072 in the short term nevirapine is better than nothing but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1599073 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance

1599101 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory

1599104 i mean im 23 theres no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
1599105 el primero tiene cuatro heridas de bala en diferentes partes el segundo tres y el tercero s lo una
1599106 pero ella s lo alcanz a ver cuando las personas que irrumpieron en la casa cogieron unas maletas y las montaron en los veh culos junto con las personas que m s tarde resultaron muertas
1599107 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1599108 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
1599109 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
1599110 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
1599111 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
1599112 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

1599114 and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too
1599115 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract
1599116 we cannot dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground
1599117 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
1599118 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
1599119 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
1599120 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
1599121 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
1599122 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
1599123 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
1599124 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
1599125 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1599126 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1599127 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1599128 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged

1599130 1 it is for freedom that christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened
1599131 2mark my words i paul tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no value to you at all
1599132 you must be saved by jesus through faith oh yeah you need to follow our jewish customs also
1599133 6for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love
1599134 12as for those agitators i wish they would go the whole way and first impression team
1599135 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1599136 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1599137 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1599138 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1599139 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area

1599158 at three there are a number of otpions the dynamics always change day to day in the draft you have to have contingency plans in everything
1599159 we have to look in all the areas including free agency and the draft for a quarterback
1599160 its how the teams want to perceive this how they want to value me i dont think im less of a player less of an investment
1599161 we ll see mr callaghan said we d decide after practice
1599162 i have been in this sport for a very long time and i have never seen such a drop in time from an elite swimmer similar drops have been made by athletes that later were proven cheaters its no fault of eamon that a lot of people are going to look at his swim suspiciously unless of course he did cheat the public has a right to be suspicious of doping when they see a drop like that
1599163 just because theres this suspicion surrounding his swim doesnt mean im responsible for that suspicion it was obviously a page turner for the tabloids in australia ive come to expect that from the irresponsible australian media they have a bad habit of taking things out of context

1599196 our first idea was to get a helicopter in to lift them off the rocks
1599197 we called a helicopter in but it takes 45 minutes for it to arrive in st davids from chivenor down in devon and it was becoming clear to us that there was a high risk they would be washed off the rocks before the helicopter arrived
1599198 so the crew on the inshore lifeboat decided that they would have to act to get the three girls off
1599199 when the need arises we have got the equipment and the crew have got the abilities if needed
1599200 there is quite a high risk of people being washed on to the rocks or being injured on the cliff face there
1599201 if they had been washed up onto the gully it is difficult to see how they could have got out uninjured

1599223 such findings are truly revolting how can patients be safe amid bed bugs fleas and rats once again safety is just rhetoric and not a reality for patients particularly the elderly and those with suppressed immunity

1599240 calitatea morala si cea profesionala sunt inseparabile mai ales fiind vorba de oameni care formeaza minti pentru ca au si activitate pedagogica
1599241 dar eu cred si in redemptie si in evolutie personala insist insa asupra recunoasterii faptelor trecute si atata timp cat in standardele academice nu exista incorporata o evaluare a trecutului pe standarde morale degeaba luam o pozitie daca nu dam si o solutie solutia ar fi in momentul evaluarii unor proiecte sa se evalueze nu doar cv ul academic ci si cel politic
1599242 eu cred ca o persoana ca herta m ller poate sa se simta jignita de prezenta intr o academie de vara a doi fosti informatori atata vreme cat mai traiesc niste oameni care au suferit crunt de pe urma vechiului regim si multi dintre ei locuiesc afara problema trebuia abordata mai delicat fiind vorba totusi de niste oameni al caror profesionalism e dincolo de orice dubiu lucrurile ar trebui privite pozitiv ei nu trebuie izolati nicidecum chiar daca au fost informatori dar atata vreme cat aceste personaje nu se dau ele singure la o parte probabil neconsiderand ca lucrurile pe care le au facut sunt foarte grave cei care ii trimit in anumite locuri ar trebui sa fie mai atenti

1599244 sa fim seriosi singurul politician care a fost deconspirat si careia i s a inchis accesul la viata politica a fost mona musca dar ce a facut ea in comparatie cu altii si se stiu ei care insa nu cred ca poti sa interzici cuiva dreptul de acces la viata publica indiferent de trecutul lui altfel am reactiona si noi ca si comunistii aceasta este una dintre marile lectii pe care o putem invata din democratie sa nu discriminam atata vreme cat nu exista nimic legiferat din aceasta cauza toata aceasta discutie este absurda o lege a lustratiei este oportuna mai ales in viata politica este imoral sa faci politica in romania dupa ce ai fost turnator si sa semnezi legi dupa ce ai fost mare comunist

1599277 it was now december 2001 yet dolan and altimaris hartford courant story was the first i had heard of the quantico letter supervisory special agent james r fitzgerald had not heard of it either in fact there were quite a few critical documents that fitzgerald had not yet seen what i wondered has the anthrax task force been doing hoping that the quantico letter might lead if not to the killer at least to a suspect i offered to examine the document my photocopy arrived by fedex not from the task force but from fbi headquarters in washington searching through documents by some 40 usamriid employees i found writings by a female officer that looked like a perfect match i wrote a detailed report on the evidence but the anthrax task force declined to follow through the quantico letter had already been declared a hoax and zero filed as part of the 9 11 investigation

1599287 for sure he cant lose missouri and thats in the upper midwest could he lose iowa minnesota and wisconsin and still be elected president yes but i wouldnt advise him to have that strategy
1599288 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1599289 ive never really understood in all my years why has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1599290 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1599291 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong
1599292 it does challenge him in states like iowa the no 1 ethanol state
1599293 thats where hes got a problem hes got to find his own voice and so far he hasnt had a voice
1599294 i have no idea why ohio and its not the message right now that any of us want to hear
1599295 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1599296 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1599297 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1599298 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1599299 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1599300 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs

1599310 i dont get a lot of pension 113 a week
1599311 my lifestyle would have to change if i didnt work
1599312 unfortunately we have one of the least generous state pensions in europe
1599313 the state pension for a single person is just over 90 a week now thats well below what would be considered a poverty line for a single person which would be 145 per week
1599314 gas and electric have gone up considerably i used to spend around 50 or 60 a month on petrol now its around 103 104 a month
1599315 if they gave you a decent pension then people like me would be able to go out and do things that they wanted to do without having to come to work
1599316 its a terrible thing when you have worked all your life and you have paid in all your life and you have to survive to live you should be able to enjoy a few luxuries at least
1599317 especially when you have these people that have never worked and seem to be doing very well on what the government are giving them and the pensioners are at the back of the queue all the time
1599318 i can just manage i wouldnt want to give up my independence i wouldnt want to go back to work
1599319 i dont think i could afford to retire its just so expensive living costs and everything at the moment you just cant put enough aside you just have to focus on the moment
1599320 after two weeks when i lost in the second and first rounds and against an opponent like isner who is not easy to play i was pretty solid
1599321 prime minister maliki is the leader of a country and im confident he will act as the president and the foreign minister both told me in the last several days
1599322 it will be directly related to the situation on the ground just as they have always said and since we are succeeding i am convinced as i have said before we will withdraw with honor not according to a set timetable
1599323 i hope that there will be a lesson for her too and that is you cant continue to support something thats wrong yknow even if its your own son and you have a responsibility to those you represent and thats what she has to consider yknow and thats what she owes to the district
1599324 la cosa giusta da fare per offrire benefici effettivi a chi colpito dal virus hiv e per ridurre il numero di nuove infezioni siamo convinti che questa decisione avr conseguente importanti per la diffusione della terapia antiretrovirale in tutto il mondo

1599326 abbiamo ancora milioni di persone che hanno bisogno di cure e solo due anni per realizzare laccesso globale questo studio dimostra che lavorando duramente lobiettivo raggiungibile
1599327 per invertire la progressione della diffusione del virus hiv ha aggiunto dobbiamo mettere fine alle disuguaglianze di genere che alimentano la malattia
1599328 in primo luogo necessario che le giovani donne imparino a conoscere e a far rispettare i loro diritti
1599329 il matrimonio viene spesso percepito come un fattore di protezione ma non lo
1599330 luso del condom continua ad essere molto poco diffuso nelle coppie sposate e con i partner fissi

1599332 adesso ha detto il padre della fondazione clinton dobbiamo trovare urgentemente le strategie pi efficaci per mantenerla la ricerca una priorit e va finanziata ma da sola non basta
1599333 finora grazie allimpegno della fondazione clinton della fondazione bill e melinda gates e del fondo globale contro turbercolosi aids e malaria siamo riusciti a portare i farmaci a tre milioni di persone nei paesi in via di sviluppo
1599334 i nuovi casi sono 50 volte pi numerosi nei paesi in via di sviluppo che nel nord del mondo
1599335 i make a lot of money these days speaking to corporations so id really prefer not to admit how
1599336 we are entirely staffed at the point we need to be
1599337 a key element of our warrior ethos is that we never leave a soldier behind on the battlefield or lost in a bureaucracy
1599338 often are more due to adult scoring than student writing
1599339 so we have a game plan for all the schools this year
1599340 we will see what teachers are doing assess it and hopefully celebrate it
1599341 ive always publicly said we have a lot of work to do well work on instructional design have a real focus and direction and expect great gains
1599342 we hire the best teachers in the country and we are quite religious about accountability in students and in teachers
1599343 we instill a good work ethic from early on and teachers are allowed to teach and get the resources they need to get the kids to the top we never teach to the aims test
1599344 we will take the scores into consideration and make some adjustments
1599345 but each school has a story to tell and we want to work with each school as an individual just as each principal works with teachers as individuals and teachers deal with students as individuals
1599346 this is not going to compromise our anti drug effort it doesnt help but it is not something thats going to have a big effect
1599347 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate

1599378 veilig vrijen is overal en altijd van belang zowel in nederland als in het buitenland in veel populaire vakantielanden komen soa en hiv infecties vaker voor dan in eigen land het is nu eenmaal een feit dat jongeren op vakantie sneller seks hebben dan onder normale omstandigheden
1599379 onveilige seks met iemand uit n van deze landen verhoogt dus de kans op een hiv infectie of een soa
1599380 veel jongeren komen dan ook met een soa terug van vakantie of maken zich tijdens of na de vakantie zorgen dat ze misschien iets hebben opgelopen of zwanger zijn daarbij komt nog dat bijna de helft van de jongeren die geen relatie hebben geen pakje condooms meeneemt dat is de reden dat we hier staan we geven voorlichting over veilig vrijen en voor iedereen hebben we gratis condooms
1599381 under normal circumstances if its raining anywhere the equestrian sport continues
1599382 i call upon the national olympic committees and international federations to be sure that we meet the deadline of compliance
1599383 i make an appeal to governments to accelerate the ratification of the unesco treaty
1599384 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1599385 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1599386 i felt a little bit embarrassed talking about doping when my country had not signed
1599387 wada will give every assistance for all stakeholders to be compliant by november
1599388 the real onus is on the countries and sports federations to ensure that the athletes who have been sent to beijing are clean
1599389 wada the ioc and bocog beijings organizing committee cannot guarantee that all athletes at the games will not try to dope
1599390 we can be sure however that anybody who dopes risks getting caught as the testing will be more frequent and significant than at any other olympic games
1599391 im glad i brought this course this monster to its knees
1599392 he never makes a golf course easier so hes perfect for major championships
1599393 at the end of the day our mission has been accomplished
1599394 i played augusta this year for the first time and torrey pines and the u s open but those dont even come close to how hard oakland hills will play
1599395 a major championship is really the players against the golf course
1599396 it has to be a total examination of a players game changes in technology force you to change the course so the test will remain difficult
1599397 the 51 open was the first site for a major championship that was drastically different
1599398 technology had changed the game the players were better too so dad added distance
1599399 but he scattered them around dad put them 180 yards off the tee in areas where they actually hit the ball he wanted the first one to catch a shot from jerry barber the second to catch one from ben hogan and the third to catch one from sam snead they all hit the ball different distances but they would have the same difficulty on the next shot
1599400 they look at where a guy hits shots and they put a bunker there
1599401 i dont get the idea of putting bunkers on both sides of a fairway thats just protecting the golf course
1599402 you have to let the ball bounce in the fairway and run with the flow of the land without fear of it running into a bunker
1599403 redesigning classic courses is delicate business you want to enhance the original design without altering the intent of the designer
1599404 our aim is for the golf course to be the test
1599405 we dont want to get in the way of the player and how the architect intended for the golf course to be played what the score is the score is
1599406 youll have to be focused and concentrate if you want to score well
1599407 when you mix things up like they did at torrey pines
1599408 you can actually make about four golf courses in one that gives the players a lot more options
1599409 all i learned about designing courses was taught to me by dad
1599410 we never took summer vacations we always spent the summer working on a golf course the workers on the construction teams were my babysitters
1599411 i told them how important that club is to my family and to me
1599412 i had been waiting my entire career for the chance to rebuild its golf course
1599413 its working out and ill just keep trying to do whatever i can to help out the club most importantly weve been playing well together and not giving in it was a nice effort by the whole team
1599414 he died before i was born but he has been an inspiration to me
1599415 it has been my dream to play professional baseball my entire life
1599416 it is expensive to travel around to all the tryouts and to play on a travel team i could never afford to do that
1599417 a lot of those guys have personal trainers i couldnt afford that either i always felt i had to work that much harder
1599418 people were talking like that in 2004 talk is nice but performance is ultimate its good people have recognised the steps made by britains swimmers but we just havent yet converted it
1599419 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1599420 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1599421 visa applications from non accredited persons do not fall within the iocs remit and we are therefore not best placed to answer you on this question
1599422 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1599423 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1599424 of course i would have liked to have been there advocating for a peaceful resolution
1599425 the mot juste is of public utility we are governed by words the laws are graven in words and literature is the sole means of keeping these words living and accurate

1599433 this is what you see and here before you black out
1599434 we certainly believe that whatever we do in exile will lead to policy changes inside tibet and with that support from the international community and media we hope to utilize all this for our freedom struggle
1599435 all tibetans not only in india and in the motherland of china they just enjoy full freedom all the talks between the central government and tibetan people are open
1599436 as an actor every type of cinema is important for me whether it is commercial or off beat i do not like being attached to any particular image all i want is to be remembered as a good actor

1599441 i am playing the love interest of tusshar kapoor and will be seen as mithun chakrabortys sister
1599442 doctor yamada got divorced around mid june and after his divorce he came alone to claim the custody of the child but according to the indian laws a single father cannot adopt a girl child this is a major legal hassle arising in this case but the question is when the child has fathers 50 per cent dna where does the point arise of him having to adopt the child as he is her natural father
1599443 we took no chances and got the court premises vacated bomb disposal squad team and sniffer dogs had been pressed into service
1599444 she was such a lovely girl and much more than a daughter to me everyone loved her and she was really looking forward to becoming a mum all she ever wanted was to become a mum and she was so excited about her future she was beautiful and will never be forgotten she and shane were soulmates they had been together for a year and it was unbelievable how close they were we will miss her so much
1599445 the doctors were brilliant they couldnt have done anything else for her its an absolute tragedy and we are all devastated
1599446 she was a brilliant aunty and was more like a mum to deekan she loved him so much and he will miss her
1599447 our condolences go to kayleighs family with whom we have already spoken both a and e and maternity staff were deeply distressed and we have offered them additional help and support the coroner has been notified and we are unable to comment further at this stage
1599448 we scratched and we clawed and we pulled some runs together ive been talking about that all year long the will to fight
1599449 it feels like youre hitting on sound at that point in time
1599450 hes one of those guys that obviously throws a very plus plus fastball in that situation all i was really trying to do was put the barrel on the ball hes generating so much power with his fastball if you hit it solidly which is rare its going to go a long way
1599451 i can count probably four other times that its been like this

1599464 big brother producer endemol the german parent of five rtl and italys mediaset are all seen as possible buyers
1599465 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1599466 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops atrial fibrillation over 10 years
1599467 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1599468 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation
1599469 we have enrolled patients who have atrial fibrillation already to see whether exercise improves their quality of life
1599470 preliminary data appears to be that they feel better and function better
1599471 there are additional strong reasons for the public to focus on exercise
1599472 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1599473 all of sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1599474 the only problem is that my feet hurt i spent seven days on that mountain it was hard it was terrible
1599475 this accident is a very sad and disastrous event in our mountaineering history
1599476 is it better to be happy and no nothing or be miserable and no everything
1599477 how does my inability to accept grace or mercy from others reflect my understanding of gods grace for me

1599479 because of the lords great love we are not consumed for his compassions never fail
1599480 the lord is my portion therefore i will wait for him
1599481 we want to connect armenians in the diaspora with armenians in the homeland
1599482 through this day camp youth corps can do just that and also provide direct assistance to underprivileged most valuable and vulnerable citizens
1599483 its only been a couple of days and you can already see the bond forming between our campers and the youth corps counselors
1599484 this really expresses a connection between armenians despite their geographic origins
1599485 in the diaspora we have grown accustomed to the idea that armenian youth activism starts and ends with educational lectures and protests but thats just one small aspect of what it means to be an involved armenian
1599486 when you send money to armenia the people only see the money but when you come here role up your sleeves and help they see that armenians in the diaspora care
1599487 i wanted to build connections with the people here as a camp counselor i am doing just that
1599488 you really feel that this is your homeland after spending an entire day working and playing with the campers
1599489 i am literally investing my time energy and talents into my country and my people
1599490 the people here are really reaching out to us coming up to us on the streets to talk and thank us for opening the camp
1599491 we had spent months planning the camp working in coordination with the ayf in armenia to find a camp site create a curriculum and work out all the logistics
1599492 that took a lot of work but the most challenging part of organizing this years youth corps mission was figuring out how we were going to fund the venture
1599493 funding for the camp was done the old fashioned way
1599494 we held car washes at gas stations hosted breakfasts at community centers sold cds and t shirts from the trunks of our cars to friends and family at churches community centers the navasartian games and all types of community events
1599495 it gave me a chance to make a difference in armenia some of my best memories are from laying bricks with my friends in a karabakh village
1599496 this feels so much like college and yet it doesnt so much has changed or happened to both of us wow how cool to have a friendship that can withstand all of it
1599497 but i shouldnt feel angry sad hurt upset depressed what have you about that because
1599498 we have received a letter from vohra to visit the site we turn it down but we will convene a meeting of executive committee later in the day and then reply
1599499 we have already made the sass stand clear to the governor that nothing short of revocation of cancellation order and restoration of powers to the board will be acceptable
1599500 the prime minister is pleased to direct that the federal government will carry out further deliberations on coordinating intelligence efforts
1599501 sir would it be fair to say you dont know how many officers you have working here
1599502 the only reason to come here was to review the tensed situation here we were told that there is a situation of civil war here i would like to inform you that no abnormal situation is prevailing in singur and work is progressing well
1599503 even if any possibility of civil war arises local police and local administration has provided all necessary security arrangements to tata motors so that that they can continue their work here without any hindrance
1599504 forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
1599505 uhmmm the sun came out right before we went on it didnt stay out but i felt like it was just kinda of like a rainbow from god a promise that hed be with us
1599506 fuck get me out of here this is so beneath me
1599507 who are you or more to the point where are you
1599508 youve been hearing a lot about quantum physics and all the strange conclusions that it leads to in your world so i thought it was time you heard from me and got a picture of how the world looks from a quantums point of view
1599509 as to where i am i am everywhere and nowhere always and nowhen
1599510 and all the other zillions of quanta in the universe for in many ways were all exactly the same
1599511 each of us is the smallest possible packet of energy in the universe
1599512 in your world you also call us photons the smallest unit of light
1599513 now when i speak of light i am talking not just of the visible light you see with your eyes i mean the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation of which visible light is just one tiny range of frequencies
1599514 then why did you say you were all the same
1599515 light has many different colors heat i can feel on my skin and ive been told to keep well clear of gamma rays they all seem very different to me
1599516 however although our energies vary enormously there is one thing about us that is always the same we all each and every one of us possess exactly the same amount of action
1599517 youre familiar with the terms mass velocity momentum and energy i presume
1599518 and you learned how they relate to each other an objects momentum for example is its mass multiplied by its velocity and work is energy multiplied by distance action is just another one of these qualities but it is not one you normally hear about at school
1599519 the amount of action in any action is defined as the objects momentum multiplied by the distance it travels or it can also be expressed as the objects energy multiplied by the time it is traveling
1599520 if he were to throw the balls twice as fast would there be more or less action
1599521 and if the balls were much heavier like croquet balls would there be more or less action to his action
1599522 and if he ran around for twice as long how much action do you think there would be
1599523 so the concept of action isnt really that strange is it
1599524 your mathematicians have discovered that whatever happens in the universe happens in such a way that the total amount of action is always the lowest possible
1599525 yes and it apples to everything even light when you see a reflection in the looking glass the light comes back to you at the precise angle that involves the least amount of action
1599526 hmm im beginning to see why action is so important
1599527 stop please i get the picture you are a very very very tiny unit of action
1599528 yes the smallest possible action in the universe its called plancks constant after max planck who first discovered us each one of us each and every one of us is exactly this amount of action
1599529 id never thought of it like that before but i suppose it sort of makes sense after all light never stops moving it can travel right across the universe and at great speed light never rests it never slows yes action seems kind of appropriate
1599530 that may be how you see light but we see ourselves very differently as far as we are concerned we dont ever experience ourselves traveling anywhere we never move at all
1599531 im used to paradoxes in this quantum world of yours but how can you say you never travel anywhere when you so clearly do if you never go anywhere how come light gets to us from the sun and how come light has speed
1599532 hold your horses my dear and ill try to explain but first ill need to take you on a little excursion into the theories of another of your great scientists albert einstein
1599533 like many other scientists of his time einstein was puzzled by the fact that light always seemed to travel at the same speed no matter how fast you might be moving
1599534 no but maybe young albert had read about your adventures with her
1599535 after a lot of thought he decided to accept that you could never catch up with light however fast you went
1599536 his equations predicted that the faster something went the more slowly its clocks would run
1599537 sounds more like the looking glass world than my world
1599538 well it turns out that your world really is a bit like the looking glass world
1599539 and its not just time that shrinks space is also changed lengths measured in the direction of motion become shorter and in exactly the same proportion as time slows if you were to travel a measured mile at 87 percent the speed of light youd measure the distance to be only half a mile
1599540 you mean space and time really arent fixed after all
1599541 right theyre not as absolute as people had thought how much space and how much time you observe is relative to your speed thats why einstein called it relativity
1599542 but he also discovered that not everything about time and space was relative people moving at different speeds may disagree on how much space and how much time they observe but they all agree on the total amount of space and time
1599543 exactly or rather not exactly space and time dont add up by simple arithmetic in fact you get the total by doing a subtraction
1599544 doing addition by subtraction now thats the sort of arithmetic the red queen would like
1599545 the mathematical formula for combining space and time is more complicated than that its something like the square root of space squared minus time squared
1599546 i think ill skip that im confused enough as it is but whats all this got to do with light and you saying that light never travels anywhere
1599547 well the equations of relativity predict that at the speed of light length shrinks to nothing and time slows to a complete standstill
1599548 you mean space and time just disappear that is bizarre
1599549 why do you say things cant travel at the speed of light
1599550 ah thats because not only space and time change with speed but so also does mass whereas space and time decrease with speed mass does the opposite the faster you go the heavier you become if you reached the speed of light your mass would become infinite
1599551 but some things do travel at the speed of light
1599552 so you arent subject to the same cosmic speed limit as we are
1599553 and so you always travel at the speed of light
1599554 no thats just how it appears to you in your world on our side of the quantum looking glass things look very different
1599555 i said that at the speed of light distance and time shrink right down to zero
1599556 the red queen was still living in the world of things the world of space time and matter
1599557 but i thought einstein said that the speed of light was the same for all observers
1599558 what you think of as the speed of light is from our perspective something very different you remember me saying that all observers always agree on the total amount of spacetime separating two events even though they disagree on how much actual space and how much actual time they observe
1599559 well when you calculate the total amount of spacetime between the two ends of a light beam the result is always exactly zero
1599560 this is something even we photons agree upon except that we dont experience a beginning and an end we observe ourselves traveling zero distance in zero time subtract zero from zero and what do you get
1599561 exactly however you look at it the combined amount of spacetime for light is always zero
1599562 you observe a separation between the beginning and end of a light beam the zero spacetime of light has manifested as some space along with some time since the total must remain zero the amount of space that appears is exactly balanced by the amount of time that appears
1599563 what you observe as the speed of light can be thought of as the ratio of manifestation of time and space for every 186 000 miles of space there appears 1 second of time it is this ratio that is fixed this is why the so called speed of light in your world is always the same
1599564 is the light i see in my mind the same light as the light i see in the world

1599589 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1599590 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1599591 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1599592 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1599593 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1599594 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1599595 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1599596 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood

1599644 allah memiliki sembilan puluh sembilan nama seratus kurang satu barangsiapa memperhitungkannya dia masuk surga artinya mengenalnya dan melaksanakan hak hak nama nama itu
1599645 sungguh akan kami berikan cobaan kepadamu dan sedikit ketakutan penyakit kelaparan kekurangan harta jiwa dan buah buahan
1599646 yang pertama tama dipertanyakan diperhitungkan terhadap seorang hamba pada hari kiamat dari amal perbuatannya adalah tentang shalatnya apabila shalatnya baik maka dia beruntung dan sukses dan apabila shalatnya buruk maka dia kecewa dan merugi
1599647 dan hendaklah ada diantara kamu orang orang yang mengajak kepada kebaikan dan menyeru kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar dan merekalah orang orang yang beruntung
1599648 serulah manusia kepada jalan tuhanmu dengan hikmah dan pelajaran yang baik dan bantahlah mereka dengan cara yang lebih baik
1599649 maka bertanyalah kepada orang yang mempunyai pengetahuan jika kamu tidak mengetahui
1599650 sedikit ilmu lebih baik dari banyak ibadah cukup bagi seorang pengetahuan fiqihnya jika dia mampu beribadah kepada allah dengan baik dan cukup bodoh bila seorang merasa bangga ujub dengan pendapatnya sendiri
1599651 apakah kamu mengira akan masuk surga padahal belum datang kepadamu ujian seperti yang dialami orang orang terdahulu sebelum kami
1599652 aku tinggalkan untuk kalian dua perkara kalian tidak akan sesat selama berpegangan dengannya yaitu kitabullah al quran dan sunnah rasulullah saw
1599653 sabar yang sebenarnya ialah sabar pada saat bermula tertimpa musibah

1599656 ada 3 hal yang termasuk pusaka kebajikan yaitu merahasiakan keluhan merahasiakan musibah dan merahasiakan sodaqoh yang kita keluarkan
1599657 tidak disengat seseorang mukmin itu dua kali dalam satu lubang
1599658 tiada seorang muslim tertusuk duri atau yang lebih dari itu kecuali allah mencatat baginya kebaikan dan menghapus darinya dosa
1599659 allah menguji hamba nya dengan menimpakan musibah sebagaimana seorang menguji kemurnian emas dengan api pembakaran
1599660 seorang hamba memiliki suatu derajat di surga ketika dia tidak dapat mencapainya dengan amal amal kebaikannya maka allah menguji dan mencobanya agar dia mencapai derajat itu
1599661 para nabi kemudian yang meniru menyerupai mereka dan yang meniru menyerupai mereka seseorang diuji menurut kadar agamanya kalau agamanya tipis lemah dia diuji sesuai dengan itu ringan dan bila imannya kokoh dia diuji sesuai itu keras seroang diuji terus menerus sehingga dia berjalan di muka bumi bersih dari dosa dosa
1599662 besarnya pahala sesuai dengan besarnya ujian dan cobaan sesungguhnya allah azza wajalla bila menyenangi suatu kaum allah menguji mereka barangsiapa bersabar maka baginya manfaat kesabarannya dan barangsiapa murka maka baginya murka allah
1599663 dan janganlah kamu bersikap lemah dan janganlah pula kamu bersedih hati padahal kamulah orang yang paling tinggi derajatnya jika kamu orang orang yang beriman

1599679 illegal immigration is a huge problem in the united states that will only worsen if we continue to play games instead of getting serious about real reform
1599680 border fences are expensive distractions paid for by taxpayers from addressing the causes of illegal immigration
1599681 building a fence wont fix these problems that are at the heart of why people come to this country illegally
1599682 people are breaking the law and entering illegally because it is easier to swim the rio grande than to climb the mountain of paperwork
1599683 the solution to defending our border and sovereignty must make it easier for peaceful people to enter the country legally
1599684 we understand that we must have a secure border and keep out those who present a threat to national health or security
1599685 immigration policy should be a realistic reflection of our society
1599686 too much regulation hurts our economy by limiting the pool of cheap labor and creates incentives to enter the country illegally too little leaves the united states open to harm immigration reform should balance the needs of our economy with the need for domestic security a border fence does not fully address this need

1599694 the industry has come through two similar periods in the 1980s and the 1990s but this is deeper far deeper
1599695 in fact it has been characterised by some of my senior members as similar to if not worse than the downturn in the 1970s

1599870 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
