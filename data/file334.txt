3340001 hes got as good of stuff as ive ever seen
3340002 dont be surprised if duchscherer has a big season hes got excellent stuff and put up some very gaudy numbers while mainly being a reliever during his career
3340003 will kimmey of baseball america says major league scouts have definitely taken notice all indications are that lincecums performance this season will earn him a top 10 if not a no 1

3340009 it was said that he was six feet tall with sparkling sea grey eyes and a voice so sweet as to silence even the holy angels
3340010 tall and thin and walked in a way that stooped his round colourless head between his shoulders making his head look smaller than it really was though some of that could have been distance he was so tall that his head was a long way off from polly like a very tall tortoise polly thought
3340011 due to the size and scale of the level 3 network our company has been a leader in the development adoption and deployment of new standards and we intend to follow a similar path with regard to ipv6
3340012 we are pleased to build upon our long standing relationship with the gsa and to have played an instrumental role in the gsas transition to the next generation of technology
3340013 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3340014 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3340015 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3340016 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3340017 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3340018 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3340019 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3340020 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3340021 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3340022 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3340023 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3340024 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3340025 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3340026 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3340027 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3340028 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3340029 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3340030 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position
3340031 i was still new to the game but had just inked a deal with maverick records and the warner brothers records family and thought i could tell somebody what i was learning after a major label debut a year on the road and a pocket full of lessons mainly things not to do i took the experience i had learned from working in the industry and started recording demos for friends and bands in the area
3340032 when we put a detainee in jail the detainee will be seen by others
3340033 indonesian corruptors are shameless they get their names and deeds splashed in the press all the time and no one cares
3340034 the only thing that works in fighting corruption is consistent non political prosecutions and jail time starting at the very top
3340035 it can be our menu changes almost every day were very flexible in what we work with but were very limited too for example we have a limited portion of each item because there are only two strip loins in a cow that equates to 30 portions of new york strip loin and once it runs out thats it it goes along with the idea of sustainability
3340036 exactly so for example yesterdays first course was a salad of flowers and sprouts just being the time of year that it is nothings available theres asparagus which is finishing and radishes which are done now whats happening is plants are flowering to produce the fruits of summer but at the moment whats available is sprouts and flowers and lots of bees
3340037 well theres a preconception that comes with that that youll have new york strip loin tenderloins and sirloin and if youre cooking the whole animal youre very limited in how many of those items you can have we want to present beef as beef so what that would mean is we have a beef plate and that would be composed of meat from different parts of the animal that we prepare the best way we know how a farmer last night said something very poignant to me he said i dont raise tenderloins i raise cows thats a very important idea to think about
3340038 i was on a fishing trip in salt spring island in british columbia with my son max and i was talking with an organic farmer we talked about politics and economy farming everything i caught five sockeye salmon and i traded three of them for some of the stuff he produced turnips carrots scampi after i cooked everything it occurred to me id never had a meal like that before where i knew exactly where everything came from and i thought id probably never have a meal like that again
3340039 we make a five course menu based on ingredients from a local farm and we invite the farmers to come to the restaurant to talk about how they raise their animals and grow their produce
3340040 well we try not to talk about slaughtering chickens while people are eating but thats the reality of it theres a connection between food and eating that a lot of people ignore it should be acknowledged
3340041 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3340042 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high was well above expectations
3340043 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3340044 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3340045 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3340046 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3340047 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3340048 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3340049 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3340050 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3340051 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3340052 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3340053 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3340054 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
3340055 i think america got it pretty much right to have twitch boss and there in the final two
3340056 ive never been involved in a game like that before as a pro going wire to wire with no penalties or turnovers
3340057 those are the two things that stand out to me about tonights game and thats what we continue to emphasize around here winning edges
3340058 thats something our line takes a great deal of pride in keeping our defense fresh
3340059 converting on third and 1 is like making a statement tonight was nothing i havent seen from michael bennett before he just works hard and doesnt complain hes consistent and before you know it hes going to give you that big run
3340060 everyone in this room already knows how good michael bennett is
3340061 hes fast hes strong and hes got good vision fundamentally this was a very good game for us no penalties or turnovers thats what you want we didnt do the little things that get you beat in this league
3340062 we got into a good rhythm and when other guys came in they did a great job too
3340063 we had a good running game going tonight were going to watch the film today and there will be a lot to build on i thought we looked pretty good out there
3340064 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3340065 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3340066 you really wont know until you sit down and watch the tape but id say it was ok
3340067 its only one game but our line has taken an extra step
3340068 we kept converting on short yardage tonight and we did it convincingly where you dont even have to bring out the sticks to measure
3340069 they were all young last year and they kind of got thrown into the fire and did really well now theyre a year older and adding jeff faine at center really helps the offensive line should be one of the strong points of our team all season long
3340070 weve faced quite a bit this year the combination of the two guys being out probably does hit a new level
3340071 weve gotten where we are based on a combination of different things different players my belief is there will be guys who step up during this time period

3340074 maybe the best opening seven holes ive ever seen anyone play and all in a driving rain
3340075 i gave a couple shots back with bogeys on 8 and 11 but i finished strong with birdies on 13 and 16
3340076 i had a birdie on the front side but i dont remember because i was doing the backstroke at the time

3340192 nearly three of four registered voters in kansas support a proposed constitutional amendment that would require voter approval on all state tax increases according to supporters of the amendment the group the kansas taxpayer bill of rights coalition commissioned a poll of 400 registered voters conducted march 17 18 by cole hargrave snodgrass amp associates the poll found 73 percent of kansans favor the proposed amendment sixty six percent of voters support it even after they are presented with arguments that such a measure could make it too difficult for the state to fund education and health care
3340193 the governor is skeptical of these kinds of political measures
3340194 it would completely undercut our ability to catch up in vital areas like education this administration has been tightening belts and balancing budgets without any mandates like this bottom line the system is working

3340219 i once served drinks at a bear convention a volunteer job cuz they gave a big donation to the organization i was working at and there were bears from all over the world japanese bears australian bears mexican bears the ones without major paunch were definitely considered lower caste it was kind of sad but cool in an opposite world kind of way the official bear greeting involves simultaneous rubbing of each others bellies they really love square dancing and buttless chaps they are generally sweet natured i wonder if it is genetic like down syndrome people
3340220 they think just because they give us all this money that they can tell us what to do they should just let us do what we want
3340221 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3340222 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3340223 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3340224 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3340225 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3340226 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3340227 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3340228 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3340229 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3340230 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3340231 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3340232 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3340233 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3340356 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations
3340357 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israel s oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3340363 the conflict has been sparked by the race for control over the pipelines carrying oil and gas out of the caspian region the russians may just bear with the pro us georgian president mikhail saakashvilis ambition to bring his country into nato but they draw a heavy line against his plans and those of western oil companies including israeli firms to route the oil routes from azerbaijan and the gas lines from turkmenistan which transit georgia through turkey instead of hooking them up to russian pipelines jerusalem owns a strong interest in caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3340434 you know mr president and gents i think that now is the time for the whole party to drop the intelligent design crap its embarrassing i mean you are grown men the democrats have siezed upon some very populist ideas such as minimum wage withdrawal from iraq etc and while creationism is popular in america it is going to be the bane of our legacy just drop it stop talking about it the dems have control of congress now and there you are before the world clapping your hands for tinkerbell
3340435 you know mr president and gents i think that now is the time for the whole party to drop the intelligent design crap its embarrassing

3340446 ha sido un partido dif cil en el que no hemos jugado como sabemos hacerlo
3340447 al final en cuanto hemos defendido mejor hemos empezado a crearles problemas a los chinos
3340448 quiero felicitar a la selecci n china por su partido han planteado un encuentro duro y no nos han dejado hacer nuestro juego
3340449 creo que una de las claves de la remontada ha sido la presi n puesta en pr ctica lo que nos ha permitido correr que es lo que mejor se nos d
3340450 empezamos el encuentro con una mala mentalidad nos envolvimos del ambiente en contra
3340451 hab amos ganado a grecia con facilidad y china perdi de bastante diferencia contra estados unidos algo que nos hizo pensar que el partido te ricamente estaba ganado antes de empezar el encuentro
3340452 no estuvimos agresivos en cambio china jug muy bien con mucha velocidad fuerza y un buen porcentaje de tiro exterior
3340453 nosotros hemos jugado peor al haber dado la victoria con antelaci n cuando china tiene un extraordinario equipo
3340454 en el descanso reflexionamos y jugamos sin presi n asi que por este cambio de mentalidad forzamos la pr rroga
3340455 esta victoria nos acerca a la clasificaci n entre los 4 primeros de grupo que era nuestro objetivo
3340456 en la preparaci n demostramos que sin necesidad somos agresivos pero podemos hacerlo y debemos jugar as siempre
3340457 no he tenido miedo de usarlo porque es algo habitual en m
3340458 este chiquillo es un jugador maduro que no s lo lo ha demostrado en la pr rroga sino tambi n en los partidos de preparaci n y durante todo el partido de hoy por todo ello se hace acreedor de tener confianza en l

3340471 evil study that attemps to take people away from god
3340472 his doctrines are close enough to ours shouldnt we overlook the belief statements that dont come from our canon if the rest are compatible
3340473 why are these particular candidates running and why should we support the groups supporting them
3340474 we had a trial in my state a while back
3340475 whatever you believe about the creation of the earth we are f ing destroying it now
3340476 i for one have no problem with that attitude if the faithful always practiced sound science i wouldnt care if they believe in an invisible man who made it all happen he would eventually fade away just like all of the other great mythologies
3340477 as a member of gores climate project i can say with an extremely high degree of confidence that the adam and eve reference in the slide show is a joke
3340478 and by reporting these stories without some basic checking youre playing into their hands
3340479 i hope this doesnt cause offense this is something from my faith and i recognize that there will be many people who differ etc etc
3340480 we have often felt the presence of god and the power of prayer so although we have grown up in the church we are believers not by habit but by decision
3340481 of course faith is just a word unless it is invested with personal meaning my own faith is rooted in the unshakeable belief in god as creator and sustainer a deeply personal interpretation of and relationship with christ and an awareness of a constant and holy spiritual presence in all people all live and all things
3340482 a shared commitment to faith has always been a central element in the life of our own family our deeply held beliefs form the very core of the values we hold in common and the rituals of our faith tradition have always provided a reassuring and stabilizing rhythm to family life
3340483 its just that i dont want my president reaching for a bible metaphor when hes making a decision
3340484 and they do so because theyre expected to by their peers

3340486 wir haben festgestellt dass angeblich betroffene webseiten schwer zu erreichen sind
3340487 wenn es sich um ddos angriffe gehandelt hat waren wahrscheinlich computer aus aller welt beteiligt

3340492 wir haben zum thema warenpr sentation daher einiges unternommen und auf den weg gebracht um die faszination des mediums zeitschrift bei den verbrauchern auch im regal wieder zu steigern
3340493 umsatz hat nicht generell etwas mit absatz zu tun dass der umsatz geringer ausgefallen ist hat seine ursache darin dass wie im projektgesch ft blich einige vorhaben nicht wie geplant im zweiten quartal umgesetzt werden konnten sondern folglich in das folgequartal gerutscht sind

3340498 dazu muss man allerdings die sprache der nervenzellen verstehen das bedeutet dass man das muster ihrer elektrischen aktivit t interpretieren muss
3340499 eine schwierigkeit dabei ist das signal einer einzelnen zelle aus den signalen tausender nachbarzellen herauszufiltern ein einzelnes signal ber viele wochen hinweg zu verfolgen ist nahezu unm glich

3340508 conventional wisdom may say that you should keep your head down especially during an economic downturn
3340509 but my suggestion is that you work your tail off to be visible about the results youre producing
3340510 you want to be the squeaky wheel in the sense that youre proactive
3340511 but if you complain youre probably going to be the first one out the door
3340512 you need to take the lid off your thinking and take a look at how what you do relates to the rest of the business
3340513 if you dont know how your part in the business is connected to the others chances are youre not going very far
3340514 the main element in your career plan has to change from doing what you have to do to impress your superiors to doing what you have to do to impress yourself

3340532 we have met with the minister of fisheries and other parties of interest but for various reasons people have not been willing to participate in this in response to these swiss demands
3340533 the supermarkets just want a stamp that everyone recognizes so that they can sell the fish as a quality product at a premium price
3340534 i think environmental labeling is the largest issue of interest facing the icelandic fishing industry today
3340535 we have requested that the icelandic authorities do their best to prevent this from having further damaging consequences
3340536 representatives from icelandic authorities have attended a meeting with a swiss supermarket chain to present our point of view but the problem is caused by these supermarket chains letting wwf control which fish they sell

3340538 solana acaba de hablar por tel fono con medvedev quien le confirm su anuncio del cese de las operaciones militares
3340539 solana manifest su satisfacci n ante esa decisi n y los dos hombres acordaron seguir en contacto
3340540 confirm al presidente ruso el compromiso de la ue para llegar a una soluci n duradera
3340541 las unidades que apoyan a las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz han vuelto a su misi n defensiva y en algunos lugares de georgia contin an retirando sus tropas
3340542 aun cuando hemos recibido la orden de cesar el fuego eso no significa que hayamos suspendido todas las acciones entre ellas las tareas de reconocimiento
3340543 el acuerdo de alto el fuego debe ser firmado a n la declaraci n de dimitri medvedev podr a significar confiemos que no nos van a seguir disparando
3340544 tras el acuerdo de cese del fuego tres pueblos est n siendo bombardeados
3340545 la estrategia de georgia es un acto desesperado que sin embargo le ha permitido alcanzar su objetivo de internacionalizaci n del conflicto con un coste econ mico enorme
3340546 el presidente georgiano mijail saakashvili ha intentado mover el statu quo el marco actual de las fuerzas rusas de paz
3340547 es evidente que los soldados de paz rusos en la regi n ya no son soldados de paz
3340548 la guerra ha tenido lugar porque las posibilidades de acordar a georgia el estatuto de candidato a la otan el pr ximo diciembre fecha del pr ximo consejo de la alianza no eran cre bles
3340549 georgia siempre ha presentado la otan como un aliado es la manera para este peque o estado de intentar imponerse ante rusia
3340550 la otan siempre ha sido utilizada por georgia sin que haya habido nunca protestas oficiales
3340551 las perspectivas de una entrada de georgia en la otan se han reducido brutalmente
3340552 si un estado miembro de la otan empezara a hacer una pol tica como la de georgia para hacer avanzar sus prioridades ser a fatal para la organizaci n
3340553 esta guerra aleja a georgia no s lo de europa sino que complica a n m s el consejo de la otan de diciembre la ampliaci n de la otan a georgia debe ser postergada

3340582 the world gives us 16 days and well return 5 000 years of culture and history to the world
3340583 it was like having a purely chinese meal this should have been a real international magnificent sports meet rather than a performance of chinese culture and art
3340584 at the past five olympics the opening ceremonies demonstrated sports culture much more than this opening ceremony in beijing
3340585 the modern part about china was condensed to only a piano and a space shuttle

3340596 e eu costumo dizer que a palavra risco significa eventos adversos que podem impactar uma empresa

3340662 i am writing part two and i plan to make it with the same actors part two will be set in the current political and social scenario it will have to match up to the success of the original
3340663 i made this film with the nfdc we must give credit to the script committee of the nfdc for giving the script a chance
3340664 but it is very difficult to make a film like jaane bhi do yaaron outside the nfdc you cant make a film like this with independent producers
3340665 when i was making the film i never thought it would be such an acclaimed movie every filmmaker has some dreams and this film has given me more than i dreamt of it surpassed my expectations it has also given a lot to the entire cast and crew and its success is beyond their imagination too
3340666 after making this film i moved to television and worked there for seven years i returned with kabhi haan kabhi naa i have written a story about a prostitute and it is also a political satire the story is about a prostitute on the run who enters the vortex of by elections and ends up becoming a chief minister
3340667 when i decided to make jaane bhi i applied for a loan of rs 400 000 but later the nfdc decided to fund it the initial budget of the movie was rs 685 000 but the production cost went up and finally it was made at a budget of rs 725 000
3340668 the film came and went but it did earn profit however the film grew bigger and bigger with time at that time it was screened at the tashkent film festival

3340682 i got a chance to go there but i found out that i will have start again from scratch like screen tests and other tantrums they treat you like a newcomer so i decided to stay in mumbai and be the queen here
3340683 i havent done an out an out romantic film for a long time so when i heard the script of this film i found it a little fresh
3340684 i play radhika who comes all the way from ranchi to mumbai to become an actor but she ends up being a member of choreographer shiamak davars dance troupe

3340707 both the use of this word and the appalling portrayal of an intellectually disabled character in this movie are incredibly damaging to people with intellectual disabilities
3340708 this movie perpetuates use of a hateful word the disability community is trying to eradicate from our countrys vocabulary although the movie is considered satire this depiction of a person with intellectual disabilities is far from funny
3340709 one of the biggest challenges for people with intellectual disabilities is when society encourages this portrayal of them
3340710 its almost the worst adversity they face people like tara can do phenomenal things shes very highly accomplished
3340711 as a person with a disability the movie didnt make me feel good
3340712 i felt really horrible hearing them say the r word so many times so easily
3340713 n o julgueis para que vois tamb m n o sejais julgados na presen a do pai
3340714 we delivered solid results in the second quarter despite a difficult operating environment

3340720 che stronzata fare il concerto al bloom non potevano farlo al rolling stone o al city square che li avrebbero riempiti
3340721 it is a lovely story and you have cheered me up on a miserable day
3340722 i was on a bus and saw this gnome in the garden i think it was fate i mentally tagged it and went back the night before i left and liberated it sometime before midnight
3340723 i felt a degree of guilt as it could have been a treasured heirloom it is not something i am proud of i produced the album because i felt i owed it my best i wanted them to have the best photographs
3340724 the gnome was a great icebreaker on the trip it made friends with a lot of people it was difficult getting it through customs every time it appeared on the scanner they demanded to see it
3340725 but i have warned simon not to do it again
3340726 theres more to life than watching daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3340727 the leprechaun went missing many many months ago and i had forgotten about it
3340728 then i opened the door on thursday and saw he was back it was such a shock
3340729 i thought well its a bit of mischief but at least he hasnt been put through the window
3340730 murphy was quite badly damaged and there was a tightly wrapped parcel next to him my curiosity eventually overcame my alarm because i did wonder if it might explode
3340731 then i saw it was a beautifully bound photo album and opened it up
3340732 his feet were missing but thats no real surprise given that he was sent abseiling down a mountain
3340733 it was the strangest gift i have ever received i just keep thinking how funny it is it makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels it was a wonderful surprise
3340734 hello first of all i feel i should explain my prolonged absence a gnomes life is full of time for reflection and whilst surveying your garden one summer morning i began to get itchy feet
3340735 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you
3340736 so i decided to free myself from the doldrums of the shire and seek adventure my travels have taken me across three continents 12 countries and more time zones than i can possibly remember
3340737 there have been high points low points and positively terrifying points but i have survived small thanks to the companion with whom i have shared all these moments
3340738 said hello to the big man and he seemed a decent enough bloke but unfortunately i didnt have my camera with me
3340739 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored
3340740 the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
3340741 should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise you must take the decision to destroy them
3340742 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3340743 the hoax is a dishonourable mischievous product of desperate elements wishing to stir unnecessary anxiety discontent and tension within the targeted communities
3340744 the hoax is a disingenuous farce that undermines our constitutional democracy
3340745 our host university and corporate sponsors make canjac the business and entrepreneurial educational experience of a lifetime for canadian and international achievers
3340746 we are excited to be shaping our future economic potential through the leadership of these young global citizens as the most ethnically diverse city in canada toronto is a world class meeting place to inspire the worlds youth to create a life that enriches us all
3340747 the students who attend canjac are considered the best and brightest from across canada and around the world embarking on their post secondary ambitions with specific interest in business and related careers
3340748 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3340749 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3340750 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3340751 it will allow courts to send out a powerful signal that we will not tolerate anything which prevents people who work with the public from going about their jobs
3340752 we have heard this year about staff who work in shops pubs and betting shops facing intimidation and violence
3340753 its time that the law was tilted in their favour
3340754 this is exactly the kind of thing we want to be hearing from our politicians
3340755 i appreciate her taking the time to meet with usdaw members to learn more about their personal experiences
3340756 its just not good enough for so many of our children to be held back by a lack of basic reading and writing skills
3340757 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3340758 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3340759 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3340760 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3340761 die unsittlichkeit ist nicht im sex sondern in allem anderen mit sex bt man auch vergeltung am tod
3340762 this is a toughening up of the regulations around infection control
3340763 where there are problems nhs trusts would hope that the commission would work with them to resolve the difficulties fines should be a last resort
3340764 many times in organizations we dedicate excessive resources to micro focusing on board perceptions to me addressing ed the negative bloggers comments in a very serious way is focusing on something that is one step more removed from the mission critical functions of the association
3340765 on the whole i felt this particular case study was about people expending a lot of energy worrying about something that ultimately wasnt very important
3340766 while obviously lynn bryan and stewart wouldnt have been pleased to overhear this same conversation would it really have been taken as seriously as the same comments expressed on a blog
3340767 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3340768 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3340769 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3340770 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3340771 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3340772 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3340773 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3340774 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3340775 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3340776 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3340777 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3340778 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3340779 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3340780 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3340781 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3340782 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3340783 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3340784 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3340785 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3340786 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3340787 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3340788 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3340789 after 10 days of careful observation we are happy to see the cow is very healthy
3340790 the objective of our research is to make the transgenic animal express the antibody at high levels
3340791 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3340792 if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
3340793 the process should really lead to the beginnings of a fundamental restructuring of how cities consume energy
3340794 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3340795 although it has been known for many years that individuals with lower education have a greater risk of getting alzheimers this is the first report showing that reduced educational attainment may actually be an early sign of the underlying disease
3340796 i was immediately taken by the presence of the piece its light and color the composition and the emotion of the face
3340797 i had wanted to do a painting that represented my place in life at the time and i decided that this rembrandt work would be the touchstone upon which my piece the auditor would be based i was in something of a low point in my life i was seriously questioning its value and relevance and so i created the auditor to be a judge i chose a popular los angeles art model sara streeter for her piercing gaze and natural grace sara has a terrific energy that artists can draw upon to fill their paintings with great presence
3340798 the studies allow me to turn the cameras multiple physical impressions into my own unified artistic impression
3340799 because rembrandt was my first inspiration in painting that sense of glow and color has always been extremely important to me and i have crafted my technique around getting that effect for the past 12 years
3340800 i developed several underpainting techniques such as the right warm imprimatura the initial underpainting wash or glaze of thin color the piambura the lead white base that gives the subject greater luminosity and the verdaccio the direct painting stage during which you develop value relationships as a way of getting the sense of not just luminosity but illuminosity the effect of light coming from the canvas itself
3340801 i believe painting is a language like speech and music
3340802 in painting our words are the design drawing placement of shapes values edges color and surface texture all of which are used to validate our content
3340803 my goal was to paint only those shapes that clearly communicated my content
3340804 lately i have been called to worship at the foot of trees and i seem to be in the middle of a series of tree portraits
3340805 i like andrew wyeths idea i walk around with blank brains until i see something that really knocks me out i need an emotional attachment to carry me through a large project i had wanted to paint this scene for some time and when i saw the late afternoon sun warm up the usually gray bark i knew that was it
3340806 direct interaction enables me to gain a better understanding of the model and render depth into the portrait
3340807 a portrait painted from life is a fusion of the painters in depth study of the model and knowledge of the model as a person
3340808 i painted this portrait using loaded brushstrokes and removed any extra paint using a palette knife
3340809 the book the art spirit basic books boulder colorado has been my bible and major influence for 35 years
3340810 i had her clip some of the branches and leaves along with the plums with the intention of painting them
3340811 i am a true believer in the idea that 99 percent of life is just showing up
3340812 which is why i travel and paint a lot en plein air you meet great people and find wonderful subjects when you get out there
3340813 she posed with my collection of paper umbrellas and it was one of those great hazy mornings with cool colors
3340814 i was particularly drawn to this shot because i love to use temperature in my paintings and it gave me an opportunity to play on the cools and warms
3340815 to retain the luminous appearance found in dutch paintings the shadows must remain translucent
3340816 i needed to shift my focus at that time away from the banality of the pretty painting to something more creatively stimulating
3340817 it was also my way of throwing a spanner into the mix so to speak the galleries kept coming at me with pretty pretty pretty this series was my way of saying your job is to sell paintings not to tell me what to paint i have enjoyed painting these wanderers wayfarers and iconoclasts the way many of them see life appeals to my into the wild notion of rugged individualism and transcendental bliss
3340818 both team rac and myself are in a fantastic run of form at the moment
3340819 its crucial for me to keep the pressure on giovanardi as things can change so quickly over a weekend of racing
3340820 i cannot explain why i have had good results at knockhill in the recent past
3340821 its the most exciting thing on the horizon its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3340822 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the
3340823 its a controversial subject matter for sure but one that concerns all americans and everyone else for that matter
3340824 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3340825 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3340826 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3340827 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3340828 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3340829 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3340830 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3340831 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
3340832 with the unique audience to nbcs olympics video section doubling from august 8th to august 9th and overall traffic to nbc olympics growing by 50 percent it will be interesting to track video usage trends throughout the games

3340843 it appears that there was never any intention to reverse these closures and that is absolutely appalling
3340844 the consultation has been farcical and one sided with a real lack of feedback by on the part of the consultation team
3340845 this is all about saving money we have had petitions and 1 500 people have given us their support this is one of the most deprived parts of the country and this is a lifeline for local people
3340846 i believe this is part of a scheme to close the entire sub post office network
3340847 overall any branch closing is going to inconvenience somebody people are not going to be happy about this
3340848 these are difficult decisions which have not been taken lightly
3340849 we have considered very carefully all the comments made during the public consultation
3340850 we believe that the plan announced today offers our customers in this area the best prospect for a sustainable network in the future bearing in mind the governments minimum access criteria and the other factors the government has asked us to consider
3340851 the boy was suspended subject to the expulsion ruling of the department but his parents sent him back to school
3340852 the sgb had to make him return home as we will not take responsibility for his safety and are not in control of the parents of the girls who all had been informed and did not take kindly to the allegations
3340853 none of the parents of the girls filed criminal charges against the boy because they were satisfied with the expulsion
3340854 he has been at home since february and im worried he may fall victim to criminal acts
3340855 there was some name calling and the pair got into a fight i know he was called chocolate boy by one of his teachers
3340856 the sgb considered this a serious matter and it is up to the department and his parents to place him at another school
3340857 we will not discuss schabir shaik today if you want to raise it i will call you to order
3340858 we need to scrutinise it and make sure it doesnt open loopholes and floodgates the judicial system should never be undermined
3340859 you cant get in today sentenced for 15 years and then tomorrow you tell us you are terminally ill and therefore you need to be released i will not agree to that i am sorry i cannot agree to that
3340860 you have got to do part of your sentence you were sentenced by the courts we have got an obligation to the courts to uphold the law
3340861 so you cant just get in today and say im so terminally ill that i need to get out this cant happen
3340862 i hope they play piri weepu because he is a strong bugger and strong people tend to overplay their hand because they trust themselves more
3340863 jimmy poses more of a threat because he can run kick and he is a thinking player who can put other players into holes cowan is streetwise and if you know that kind of streetwise you know what you are up against when you play the all blacks
3340864 what we saw in dunedin was that we knew we had an ideal chance to win the game because 14 all blacks stood back and looked to one player dan carter to win it for them and do something special
3340865 the difference is we have 15 players and if they can just all do their job then we believe in ourselves and that we are much better in certain areas than any other team but i think cowan poses a bigger threat than weepu
3340866 south africa scrummed really well against argentina and took their chances well so were expecting a pretty tough encounter cj van der linde was good and will have a lot of confidence going into this game
3340867 i cant say too much but definitely he is one of the best in the world so i am not sure why he would not be here
3340868 with him and cj youve got two pretty good tightheads but bj is definitely one of the best in scrummaging so i am not sure why he has been left out he gives them a solid platform and a good right shoulder
3340869 it keeps surfacing it gets said every week and you get sick of it
3340870 you just try and play competitively within the laws they the boks will try and pressurise us on our ball and get into me on an angle and the same sort of thing happens with us on their ball
3340871 people dont want to see scrums become nothing they still want a bit of the good old stuff between teams who want to have a go at each other i dont think its cheating just having a go at each other
3340872 section 137 of the act is ignored compensation cannot be obtained and therefore a pattern of arbitrary deprivation of property ensues
3340873 no reasons are given let alone written reasons as required by the constitution
3340874 you cant be paid for doing away with an evil thing
3340875 parliament clearly intended that section 137 of the act should encourage the surrender of firearms a n aim which jasa wholly supports in our crime ridden society

3340883 with less spending money than ever higher petrol prices and busier lifestyles it makes perfect sense for consumers to turn to the internet to fulfil their shopping needs

3340891 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3340892 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3340893 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3340894 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3340895 as service provisions a critical aspect of cloud computing grow vendors must become or partner with service providers to deliver their technologies indirectly to users

3340900 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
3340901 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
3340902 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and a lot of it goes back to previous education
3340903 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
3340904 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
3340905 its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
3340906 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
3340907 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go
3340908 you cant expect them to do the job we want them to do without having the right tools
3340909 i want to change the old policy ill go to america ill learn special training and come back here where i will teach my junior officers in the future
3340910 it will help change my country my army everything will be better
3340911 commando forces are like we say the jewel of the army
3340912 its precious forces for the afghan national army we have the best training we have the best equipment and we can conduct dangerous missions
3340913 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
3340914 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
3340915 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 to 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
3340916 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
3340917 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
3340918 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
3340919 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
3340920 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight
3340921 you need to feed them you need to resupply them you need to give them equipment you need to give them mobility cars trucks helicopters
3340922 the good news is that there may be still a possibility to move this forward and conclude these negotiations within the time frame which all the wto members had agreed since last year that is end 2008

3340927 crude futures have fallen 20 from early july highs any fall from recent peaks is welcome but 115 120 per barrel remains high by any measure sustaining inflationary concerns not least in developing importer countries
3340928 while oecd demand could still surprise us on the downside non oecd prospects particularly for china and the middle east gulf could be subject to upside adjustment

3340943 lo que todos sabemos es que el se or rodr guez zapatero aprob un estatuto y ahora por lo que se ve no est dispuesto a cumplirlo y eso ha originado un problema grav simo dentro del psoe pero a mi no me preocupan los problemas del psoe sino que me preocupan los problemas de los espa oles
3340944 le pasa a quien act a como aprendiz de brujo
3340945 est metido en el problema y no sabe c mo salir
3340946 l es el presidente del gobierno y tiene que dar una soluci n
3340947 la sensaci n que se est transmitiendo es que el gobierno est absolutamente a la deriva
3340948 yo lo que le ofrezco al se or rodr guez zapatero es un consenso y un acuerdo en esta materia pero es su responsabilidad aceptar esta oferta que el partido popular le est haciendo
3340949 afecta a la propia estabilidad del psoe y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3340950 lo peor que nos puede pasar a todos los espa oles es que encima los apoyos del gobierno est n divididos
3340951 ha generado un l o muy importante dentro de su propio partido
3340952 le amenaza ahora con no apoyar los presupuestos generales del estado y hacer caer el gobierno
3340953 no era buena para los catalanes ni para el conjunto de espa a
3340954 y ahora continu el se or rodr guez zapatero con su actuaci n est enga ando a la gente una vez m s
3340955 es que cumpla lo que el propio rodr guez zapatero aprob
3340956 si el se or rodr guez zapatero lo aprueba y no lo cumple la pregunta habr que hac rsela a l
3340957 lo que ha sembrado zapatero no es bueno para espa a
3340958 en pol tica como en tantas y tantas facetas de la vida cada uno recoge lo que siembra y desgraciadamente lo que ha sembrado rodr guez zapatero como estamos viendo ahora no es nada bueno para espa a
3340959 a hablar a dialogar y a buscar un acuerdo entre todos
3340960 este espect culo que tiene como responsable al presidente del gobierno tiene que terminar
3340961 he hoped that the bar council got the message that
3340962 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
3340963 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
3340964 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
3340965 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
3340966 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times
3340967 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
3340968 im rahmen des 10 j hrigen bestehens des kantonalen renaturierungsfonds zehn baggerf hrer f r ihre hervorragenden leistungen bei der umsetzung von renaturierungsprojekten geehrt
3340969 it didnt seem like such an easy robbery it was definitely planned
3340970 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3340971 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3340972 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3340973 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3340974 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3340975 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3340976 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3340977 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3340978 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3340979 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3340980 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3340981 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3340982 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3340983 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3340984 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3340985 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3340986 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3340987 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3340989 let me assure kenyans that this government will do everything possible to prevent us from ever again being attacked
3340990 we have a 24 hour surveillance on our borders to ensure that similar strategies do not occur
3340991 would generate the very disaffection and extremism on which terror thrives
3340992 it would be sheer madness to target it islam or its followers our sole target is terrorists
3340993 the short lived unity among political leaders following the incident and other political crises and concerns
3340994 but from the intense interest that this 10th anniversary has kindled you will see a more organised national philanthropic spirit tackling the issues that bedevil survivors
3340995 even as we express solidarity with the suffering we must pay tribute to the heroic way so many have coped
3340996 but if whoever responsible decides to compensate the victims then she wont mind
3340997 the activities and utterances of criminal gangs such as the one attributed to the so called mend are totally condemned and government will continue to ensure that the perpetrators face the wrath of the law
3340998 further against the background of governments unabating commitment to fight against corruption it cannot condone let alone be involved in bribing anyone or any organisation under any circumstances including the current attempts at intimidation extortion and blackmail by the criminal opportunists from the niger delta area
3340999 disregarding our threat will be putting the expatriate staff nationwide including the two currently being held hostage at risk for which the management of julius berger should be held liable
3341000 i met retired president daniel moi former us secretary madeleine albright ambassadors and so many dignitaries i just thank god that i am alive
3341001 i decided to run downstairs to see what had happened
3341002 it was hot down there breathing was difficult and i could not scream for i was choking on the dust
3341003 it was dark and hot i thought the building was on fire luckily someone came and rescued me
3341004 when i was told i passed out i could not imagine it
3341005 i was waiting to die i knew i would die i stopped living even the medication would not work in that state of mind
3341006 i began appreciating life i did not know that everyone was important when i was in hospital street boys would come clean our wards we would send them with money and they would bring change at times they even got us some items with their own money it was encouraging
3341007 it is hard how do you as a woman avoid cold water how would you insist on hot water when visiting a friend
3341008 my prescription requires that i eat some kind of food that costs sh800 per kilo
3341009 i need two kilos per week which is sh1600 per week where would i get such kind of money on my salary
3341010 he looked at me and asked where is your god
3341011 ik ben titelverdediger maar ben hier een outsider hopelijk een heel gevaarlijke outsider
3341012 daarin ga ik weer een tandje harder en dan hoop ik de finale te zwemmen dan ga ik nog iets harder maar dat geldt ook voor mijn concurrenten je moet re el zijn er wordt echt ongelooflijk hard gezwommen het stimuleert me niet dat mijn naam niet bij de favorieten wordt genoemd zoals bij de estafettevrouwen maar zij hebben me wel ge nspireerd ik hoop dat ik die lijn kan doorzetten
3341013 de ontlading was niet zo groot als ik had gehoopt dat kwam ook omdat ik zag dat de cubaanse moegestreden was
3341014 dat moet het zijn geweest ik was de eerste drie partijen zo gespannen het kon gewoon niet goed gaan daarna is de bondscoach nogal tegen me te keer gegaan kennelijk hielp dat ik was bezig met niet verliezen in plaats van met winnen
3341015 he reached out his window and kind of pushed her off the vehicle and then struck her a second time

3341051 we are pleased to see continued international demand for clean diesels technologies and solutions as compliance requirements become increasingly stringent worldwide and low emission zones lezs are enacted in major cities in london we have seen exceptional pickup for our technologies in light of the lez furthermore our recent licensing agreement with hilite international inc is clear evidence we have been aggressively working to expand our global market position through strategic partners we have also been pursuing additional verification and approvals of our oem and retrofit applications such as the recent approval of our technologies to supply the scottish government emissions reduction register program additionally we have been enhancing our global sales organization with the appointment of key personnel to support our anticipated growth as well as a number of new initiatives on the marketing front including the launch of our new corporate website www cdti com
3341052 our strategic license agreement with hilite international a leading supplier of automotive powertrain components represents an important new distribution partner with deep penetration into the heavy medium and light duty commercial vehicle and passenger car markets the license enables hilite to utilize our aris airless injection technology and the patented combination of selective catalytic reduction scr with exhaust gas recirculation egr to reduce oxides of nitrogen nox emissions and to optimize fuel economy this agreement comes on the heels of our agreements with bosch and tenneco and provides further validation of our global licensing strategy and intellectual property strength
3341053 we have experienced strong product sales and revenue growth directly related to londons lez legislation the most recent compliance deadline for vehicles greater than 3 5 metric tons occurred in july 2008 and clean diesel is now one of the leading suppliers of emission control technologies for the london lez although direct product sales are more capital intensive than licensing our technology our strategic decision to obtain certification and supply product for the lez program has proven an effective means of seeding the market as evidenced by the credibility we have gained both in europe and globally we believe this strategy has opened the door to additional markets for the technology as we pursue our longer term strategy of licensing the technology through our global distribution partners this licensing strategy will help reduce our costs considerably in the next 18 months

3341067 when i woke up the wall dividing my office from that of the secretary was partly lying on my legs and the concrete slab above me was slowly coming towards me i panicked and tore off pieces of the curtain box and tried to push the slab away
3341068 i could see the sky and hear a lot of noise and knew something had gone wrong since i was totally pinned down under a lot of things
3341069 i had a massive hole in my chest no broken bones but the entire tricep on the left arm had been cut off a piece of glass had pierced my left eye and the right one could not see there were also numerous cuts all over my body
3341070 i think everybody has died and i know our son is among them
3341071 it was impossible to recognize anybody because there was a lot of blood and many of the bodies were mutilated i just went home and a friend volunteered to search for my son
3341072 i left the other officers still debating and ran to the road where i flagged down a passing vehicle
3341073 the driver refused to go any further so i jumped out of the car and ran towards ufundi cooperative
3341074 the way was blocked with boulders and covered with smoke so i decided to go round the back
3341075 people were lying on the ground while others were falling from the building
3341076 nilipoteza fahamu nikasimama nikiangalia tu i lost comprehension and stood astound
3341077 i spotted an army ambulance and recognised the driver he was a surgeon on his way to deliver supplies i called him and together we began to load the injured into the ambulance and took them to armed forces memorial hospital
3341078 most of the injuries were caused by the falling rocks the bomb that was used was a combination of highly explosive materials it was intended to bring down the building
3341079 every day as i look into the mirror the past stares back at me each glance at a scar reminds me of the time i spent trapped under pieces of broken glass and burning furniture
3341080 i wanted to find what was going on so i tried to get out of the car but just as i was opening the car door i heard two loud explosions
3341081 so i hesitated for a while thinking they were gunshots
3341082 teachers and bank workers were on strike so i thought they were demonstrating and the bangs were as a result of teargas canisters from anti riot police
3341083 it was dark i thought i had gone blind each time i opened my mouth to get some air i was choked by dirt particles from burning furniture
3341084 a simple slum of the door makes me panic at times even ironing becomes a problem because i fear that the iron box might explode any moment and make me relieve the horrors
3341085 we bought it from kenya after normal supplies dwindled due to delays we saw an opportunity and took it
3341086 we work in three groups one group is at sea now looking for ships to hijack the other two including mine are next in line we all share the ransom money
3341087 they have gained experience and hijack big ships that fetch them good money

3341104 al final las obras de los planes provinciales de 2006 en el ayuntamiento de d dar se han comenzado a ejecutar en julio de 2008 parece ser que el pp y el se or granados en su municipio hacen todo lo posible para que las obras se retrasen y tener argumentos para decir que no se cumplen los porcentajes
3341105 es una realidad y as he querido transmitirlo al empresariado granadino a quien vuelvo a reiterar la buena voluntad institucional para paliar en la medida de lo posible mediante nuestra contribuci n al momento dif cil que atraviesa el sector

3341107 su actitud a la hora de ofrecer porcentajes relacionados con el retraso de ejecuci n de los planes provinciales sin aclarar el porqu
3341108 en la mayor a de las ocasiones esta demora viene dada por el respeto de la instituci n que preside hacia la autonom a de los consistorios en su toma de decisiones respecto al destino de las obras que los ayuntamientos ponen en marcha y los tr mites y plazos de su ejecuci n

3341117 we are working very hard with the europeans to try to resolve the conflict
3341118 the russians have said that the one thing they want is for the u s and the europeans not to do things such as bring georgia and ukraine into nato does that suggest options i dont know
3341119 what there is to lose is the stability of the framework that the u s thought was going to govern the post cold war world when one country conquers another thats typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not all that accustomed to
3341120 what they have to be thinking in moscow is that the bush administration is only around for another five months
3341121 the dynamic might be different if it was the beginning of the new administration and they were trying to shape a new relationship
3341122 russias goal is not to occupy georgia but to assert its own interests in the region and to humiliate embarrass and eventually dislodge saakashvili from power once it has humiliated him enough and made its point then it would be ready to negotiate a diplomatic settlement
3341123 people always have some explanation but it just seems to me they just dont like people who look like me

3341161 what happened to jaeda she was here just a minute ago
3341162 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3341163 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3341164 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3341165 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3341166 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3341167 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3341168 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production
3341169 these factors may promote the long term use of proton pump inhibitors leaving patients at increased risk of osteoporosis related fractures

3341174 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei this partnership between the worlds major corporations and increasingly its cities highlights the importance of the cooperative action needed to successfully counter climate change working together and with the best data we can manage this problem and leave our children and grandchildren a healthier and more sustainable planet

3341176 isnt there a right to free speech isnt this right in line with our time honored tradition with the dems
3341177 these intimidation tactics have a chilling effect on people feeling comfortable speaking up
3341178 we wanted to explore with ms millstone the possibility of her voluntarily resigning her position
3341179 its inevitable within a party of this size that there will be different views about the merits of the candidates that the parties put forward
3341180 priority to ensure ms millstones delegate status was not in jeopardy
3341181 were getting too near the convention and shes refused to come in
3341182 it makes me want to now really be even louder about issues and concerns that before i was willing to look the other way

3341184 school mental health issues are not on the radar screen yet in raleigh
3341185 we look forward to the positive benefits of the program

3341188 my mother was depressed but would never go to a doctor
3341189 i didnt know she was crazy all i knew at the time was that it was good material
3341190 i cant be specific because someone might try it and blow their brains out
3341191 it tells you where to go if you are an alcoholic everyone knows you go to aa but if you are a cutter how do you know where to cut er go
3341192 i wanted to be a shrink when i was growing up i majored in psychology at berkeley and got sidetracked into acting
3341193 there are probably as many depressed plumbers as comedians i had builders in my house and there was someone with an issue on every floor lots of tears
3341194 whereas jennifer saunders is the worlds most level headed person
3341195 there is some connection between controlling an audience and wanting to be in control of the world
3341196 if you live in the country you might be ok but the minute you go to a city you crash and burn it is caused by stress living longer competing more for fewer jobs look at kids and knives thats a mental health issue i could go on
3341197 therapy is the last boom industry people used to talk to the priest or the rabbi now there is no one to talk to so sadly it has to be the therapist
3341198 youve got a man who is severely mentally ill theres no dispute on that
3341199 the only issue is whether he dies in prison as a result of lethal injection or whether he dies in prison as the result of a natural life
3341200 it is in my opinion that although mr banks has a psychotic disorder he has sufficient mental capacity to understand that he has been tried convicted and sentenced to death as a result of the death of 13 people
3341201 had been vacated by god and his continued incarceration and execution was the result of a wide range conspiracy between the correctional officers prosecutors and other government officials
3341202 competency to be tried is different than competency to be executed
3341203 you can go through a whole round of appeals on his competency to be executed and you could come back four years later and his condition could have deteriorated
3341204 anyone who knew him knows how he was he was just so outgoing it was amazing
3341205 when they went to serve breakfast about two hours after he got there they found him in his cell

3341213 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3341214 russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3341215 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3341216 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past

3341220 de ello hace ya muchos a os pero alcaraz ha mantenido viva la herida en su coraz n
3341221 i dont think the desire is overt in embellishing or inventing generally in either case for the admirers of xavier theres the desires to glorify so too with jesus but even that i think is overridden by the crisis of disconfirmation that was jesus death here was acute devastating cognitive dissonance given a credulous worldview pre disposed to magical thinking in both cases legend happens a follower of jesus reports several days after jesus death that she had a vision of jesus in a dream relayed to another follower that becmes just a vision passed on once again it morphs from vision to appearance at this point passed along in passionate retelling to others sympathetic to the legend credulous in their worldview jesus has now appeared isnt that miraculous if you are part of the growing sub sect that is harboring the fantasies of resurrection and you hear james was brought in and stoned by the romans why of course it would be because he was preaching the resurrection it might have been so you think therefore it was
3341222 so far as we know all the followers of these first century messianic movements were fanatically committed to the cause they if anybody might be expected to suffer from this blessed twentieth century disease called cognitive dissonance when their expectations failed to materialize but in no case right across the century before jesus and the century after him do we hear of any jewish group saying that their executed leader had been raised from the dead and he really was the messiah after all
3341223 that is if i asked you to substantiate the biblical claims that the disciples a were witness to the resurrection reappearance of jesus and b went to martyrs deaths in defense of a i think youd have great difficulty save for relying on the self attestation of the followers of jesus
3341224 i cant find grounds for the conviction that the disciples were party to the resurrection reappearances of jesus at all let alone later martyrs in witness to that claim
3341225 we dont have the reliable autobiographical or contemporary accounts in jesus case like we do with xavier if we did i believe it parallel xaviers in many respects fairly plausible biography that has fantastic legends grafted on later
3341226 for example if i recall correctly josephus has narrative on the stoning of james this account is controversial in its own right but the account as it is recounts the stoning of james the result of charges brought by the sanhedrin by breaking the law

3341229 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3341230 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3341231 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3341232 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3341233 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3341234 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3341235 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3341236 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3341237 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3341238 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3341239 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3341240 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3341241 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3341242 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3341243 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3341244 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3341245 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3341246 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3341247 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3341248 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3341249 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3341250 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3341251 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down

3341255 evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived
3341256 the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly the vile person shall no more be called liberal
3341257 and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation
3341258 i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown
3341259 if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard
3341260 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god
3341261 a sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive
3341262 by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple
3341263 if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
3341264 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine
3341265 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god

3341268 airline fares are rocketing upward along with higher fuel prices
3341269 and so are government taxes yet even if you cancel the ticket you still get stuck with the tax and if you change your flight you get hit again
3341270 anyone who looks at the cost breakdown when they buy a ticket will see a federal excise tax a security fee and airport charges they make even a cheap ticket expensive for many families
3341271 and its not obvious that we get good value for our money ask yourself how safe you feel the next time you are standing in an airport security line and the tsa employees confiscate someones bottle of water
3341272 even more outrageous though the government keeps your money even if you change your ticket
3341273 at least the airlines give you credit minus a hefty change fee of course but the federal government just pockets the money when asked about this unfair practice government employees say thats just the way the regulations are written regulations that they of course wrote
3341274 the airport taxes might be small change compared to the federal income tax but they exemplify how the government cares more about collecting money than treating taxpayers fairly that will change in a barr administration
3341275 one of the priorities of my administration will be to sharply cut and significantly simplify federal taxes we pay too much and spend too much time figuring out how much we have to pay that needs to change
3341276 lowering and simplifying taxes will make all of us better off and make our country both freer and more prosperous

3341283 i wasnt implying anything i dreamed about rabbits once myself an enormous beautiful white rabbit and it hippity hopped into baba yagas house on stilts or what looked like baba yagas house on stilts when i thought about it later you know then it blew up not the house just the rabbit it just sort of whoomfed and oozed out under the door

3341285 sometimes shed scream so loud and wild that wed all be frightened out of our minds one might my poor dad he must have been having a bad one too started screaming right after she did and oh that was a horrible sound the two of them were awake and scaring each other to death screeching their heads off in the dark and of course we got hysterical too and ran into their room it took like forever to find the light switch this became a classic family joke like the time they broke the bed i didnt think it was all that funny though mother always said her nightmares were silly the worst dreams she said once dont make you scream but she would never tell me more about them
3341286 and it cries and cries you pick it up and it cries you rock it and walk up and down with it and sing lullabies to it and it cries it makes you frantic it makes you crazy then a brilliant idea occurs to you and you get a hold of a darning needle and you thread it with fine silk wire

3341288 okay once i was trapped in my living room with antonin scalia joe was there and another couple and we were having a cocktail party and here came antonin scalia either that or saddam hussein crazed with blood lust he was chasing us around the room in slow motion with a butcher knife or no it was a gun he had this terrible gun and he was waving it around
3341289 then somehow i overpowered whoever it was and tied him up in one of our butcher block dining chairs butcher block freud alert then i picked up this knife youre right it was a knife and proceeded to cut off his arms and legs i had to do this to make absolutely sure he didnt hurt anybody it was hard work it took a long time
3341290 i havent finished i was so proud of myself then i looked over at joe he was sitting on the couch with joanne woodward and paul newman and they were all staring at me with horror and then i looked at antonin scalia and it wasnt him at all it was just a great big well baby of course after i woke up i was ill but in the dream it seemed like just the worst kind of social gaffe i was so embarrassed i was swanning around trying to laugh it off and feeding the baby who still lived plumping pillows in back of its baleful little head i kept saying look hes okay hes just fine no real harm done i kept saying hell be as good as new youll see
3341291 it was in the early days of our marriage long before the children although at that point we had just begun to try
3341292 i was killing a small mammal some sleek furry creature like a ferret or a weasel it was badly mangled but still conscious i had a hold of one of its hindquarters and was beating the animal against a wooden block until the joint loosened and ripped away this act gave me intense pleasure
3341293 when i was fully awake i ran to the john and threw up
3341294 when it came to it cringed at the sight of me and would not let me near enough to stroke its fur its eyes were terrible

3341302 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3341303 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3341304 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3341305 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3341306 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration

3341371 these findings show that even if a man is committed to his relationship he may still need to formulate strategies to protect his relationship by avoiding that available attractive woman
3341372 women have been socialised to be wary of the advances of attractive men
3341373 one interpretation of these studies is that men are unable to ward off temptation but we believe men simply interpret these interactions differently than women do
3341374 we think that if men believed an attractive available woman was a threat to their relationship they might try to protect that relationship

3341410 by adopting the uniform trade secrets act with the express purpose to make uniform the law with respect to their subject among states the general assembly has determined that public policy in ohio as in the majority of other jurisdictions favors the protection of trade secrets whether memorized or reduced to some tangible form
3341411 a trade secret is any formula pattern device or compilation of information which is used in ones business and presents an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it
3341412 the imprecise nature of the information weighs heavily against it being a trade secret
3341413 what information atchley should be prohibited from using for example should they be prohibited from using a 10 80 ratio 30 70 40 60 it thus becomes apparent it would be difficult to protect such a formula without prohibiting fair competition

3341430 coralan appears equally effective and it has less side effects than beta blockers so we would think that coralan may be used on patients who develop side effects from beta blockers or who cannot tolerate beta blockers for some reason or other for example if they have asthma beta blockers will exacerbate asthma and this is where coralan may be used

3341445 intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
3341446 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
3341447 she couldnt tell me that i wanted to give her a balloon but she didnt want that she only wants her mommy she said and she said that these people took her from her mommy
3341448 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3341449 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3341450 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3341456 the doctor said the ophthalmology exam couldnt happen because my dad would have to do the test over at a clinic to the doctor that was an impossibility my mom smiled she explained that my dad had been up in a hot air balloon so we could certainly get him to the clinic
3341457 the ophthalmologist came the next morning brought his own equipment and tested my dad at his bedside
3341458 otherwise so far so good the dialysis machine is running charlie is holding his own and anxious to get out for fall football he also promised to take me to the movies to see mamma mia and its like charlie says when all else fails he can always call dr wedemeyer

3341470 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3341471 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high

3341480 the guide contains a number of top tips on how to measure avoidable contact and minimise the number of unnecessary calls which are a waste of time effort and usually money for both residents and their local councils
3341481 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3341482 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and automatic voice response systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3341483 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3341484 the online retail market is fiercely competitive consumers expect to be able to shop quickly and easily even minor glitches in this process will lead customers to abandon their trolleys and go elsewhere

3341486 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3341487 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks

3341498 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3341499 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties

3341512 ocha is extremely concerned by the escalation and the violence the situation is deteriorating on the ground amidst a significant movement of population
3341513 thats why ocha is asking all parties to give humanitarian organisations access to people who are wounded to people who need aid
3341514 both sides blame each other for continuing hostilities in south ossetia preventing people from leaving the region
3341515 when we were discussing with the secretary about the structure of the program one of the things that became absolutely clear to us was that we should structure a program that gives some opportunity particularly for our heads of state to stand back and look at the region

3341522 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3341523 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3341524 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3341525 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3341526 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3341527 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3341528 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3341529 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3341530 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3341531 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3341532 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3341533 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3341534 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3341535 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3341568 the games development sector would naturally like to see the costs of new employment regulations included in regulatory budgets
3341569 the governments proposal to introduce regulatory budgets for government departments is an innovative approach to controlling the problem of costly regulation
3341570 the games development sector would naturally like to see the costs of new employment regulations included in regulatory budgets the cost of complying with the regulation and enforcement of the video games classification system might also merit inclusion within a departments regulatory budget the uk games development sector competes on quality not price yet keeping the regulatory burden on business relatively light could help to attract inward investment into our sector and others

3341577 im going to count to three one two two and a half
3341578 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3341579 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3341580 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3341581 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3341582 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3341583 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3341584 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3341585 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3341589 dude this is that other writing job that frigid queen was always hinting at youre one of those guys the guys who give glowing reviews to every movie that ever gets made no matter how shitty it is aw man seriously that is so weak
3341590 and they give you free sandwiches but yeah i kinda hate myself for it
3341591 youre better than this i know i give you a lot of grief but one thing i know is youre better than this anybody is better than this so nobody wants to buy your serious writing screw em find something else they want you dont have to prostitute your art because your art is sacred trust me im an artist i know what youre going through keep writing keep writing and dont ever stop but dont let somebody else turn your writing into a joke they dont have the authority only you do
3341592 yeah i guess i oughta quit the moneys good and the sandwiches are fucking heavenly man but youre right it aint worth it
3341593 you might want to be well away from the citadel of doom around 9 am tomorrow morning
3341594 what you have been expressing these days i already knew it inside of me maybe it wasnt as clear but it was there
3341595 i dont know my original face but i do know how to smile
3341596 nat rlich rgere ich mich ber diesen fehler aber wenn er nicht passiert w re h tte es auch nicht mit bronze geklappt und wenn es dann so knapp ist w ren wir auch nicht gl cklicher gewesen
3341597 solche weltrekorde kann man ja nur schwimmen wenn der k rper ausgeruht ist aber einer wie phelps schwimmt ja in peking st ndig weltrekorde der hat ja bei seinem programm gar keine pause wie regeneriert der sich
3341598 ein normaler trainer kann das nicht mehr erkl ren solche entwicklungen kann nur noch ein mediziner oder physiologe erkl ren
3341599 das ist ganz sicher eine ehre echt das ist ziemlich aufregend
3341600 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3341601 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3341602 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3341603 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3341604 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3341605 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3341606 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3341607 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3341608 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3341609 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3341610 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3341611 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3341612 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3341613 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3341614 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3341615 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3341616 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3341617 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3341618 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3341619 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3341620 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3341621 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3341622 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3341623 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3341624 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3341625 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3341631 we did really well in galle to come back and we did not capitalise on the winning of the toss here you cannot lose five wickets in the first 40 overs of a test that happened to us quite regularly in this series which is something we need to think about
3341632 for a new batsman to go in straight away and face two spinners is never easy
3341633 people got starts if they had converted it would have been a different story i do not want to give excuses overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3341634 it is not just one or two players who we should blame
3341635 it is important that everyone contributes i do not think there was enough contribution throughout the series from the middle order consistently even the lower order did not contribute consistently except one game here that is obviously something that let us down
3341636 thats still a lot of time for us to reflect on what went wrong
3341637 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3341638 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3341639 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3341640 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3341641 tenemos el mismo material desde mugello y esperamos a ver si aprilia nos echa una mano y el equipo y yo mismo nos ponemos las pilas

3341643 las fiscal as est n trabajando en la prevenci n de incendios hay una mayor y mejor investigaci n de las causas y motivaciones y por fin hay profesionales dedicados a la obtenci n de buenos elementos probatorios el resultado es m s detenidos m s juicios y m s sentencias condenatorias
3341644 todav a queda mucho por hacer en la investigaci n y persecuci n de este delito
3341645 la v a penal no sea la nica ni la principal herramienta para prevenir el problema de los incendios forestales aunque resulta fundamental para combatir la sensaci n de impunidad
3341646 al menos la mitad de los radares en un punto negro
3341647 y ello a pesar de las costosas medidas adoptadas por la dgt especialmente en lo que a la implantaci n de radares automatizados se refiere con una inversi n aproximada de m s 50 millones de euros
3341648 we are extremely pleased that both standards have been ratified as the etsi standard presents certain restrictions whereas the american fcc standard allows for high performance and maximum utilisation of rfid technology
3341649 i am pleased to join plessey at this important stage of its growth
3341650 the deregulation and liberalisation of the south african telecommunications industry is an exciting time which offers significant opportunities for the company
3341651 it would be the same thing as getting hit with a major league fastball going at about 90 miles per hour
3341652 i hear from our competitors that their shortage is finding talented people not so in michigan
3341653 this is exciting the scarcest resource is the most abundant resource in michigan
3341654 io bravisimo te no sa fare posizione melio de questo modo qui
3341655 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3341656 we dont know yet whether it was damaged its a second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3341657 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it worked perfectly
3341658 the leaders met tuesday but could not arrive at a workable formula or solution that would appease the people
3341659 the situation was slipping out of hand and the police had to open fire in which at least two people mohammad maqbool and abdul aziz were killed a few others were injured
3341660 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india external affairs ministry spokesperson navtej sarna told reporters in new delhi
3341661 the government of pakistan condemns the excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
3341662 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in iok which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people we call for immediate steps to end violence against innocent kashmiris
3341663 it is important that an enabling environment free of violence is created to sustain peace process and address the long standing dispute of jammu and kashmir
3341664 pakistan calls for immediate steps to address the situation and prevent the human rights violations in the indian occupied jammu and kashmir
3341665 with the new initiatives being undertaken by difc dubai is poised to develop further as an industry hub that rivals many of the worlds most prominent financial centres
3341666 the report shows the great dynamism of the gcc economies and their capacity to be serious players in the world economy
3341667 any changes in the exchange rate system should be carefully coordinated to enhance confidence and avoid potential confusion and volatility in regional cross rates which might be both distracting and damaging to the image of gcc cohesion
3341668 the move to a common currency would avoid such pitfalls and offer a significant boost to financial market activity
3341669 if successful this move could open up a much larger role for the gcc in global debt markets especially across the middle east and asia
3341670 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3341671 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offence known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3341672 if the basis of the round doha negotiations has to see a change in its very objectives it would be a tough going for global trade integration
3341673 the us will be able to spend much more on subsidies
3341674 one of the reasons for decline in production is the trade distorting subsidies and high tariffs in the rich countries
3341675 if eu says we are going to reduce tariffs for airplanes what does it mean for india and africa
3341676 i want to import cotton from africa but if there is 40 percent subsidy in the us my industry is not going to buy it from africa
3341677 i would have thought cotton would have become a goodwill case cotton must be tackled seriously
3341678 i learnt that developed countries had already been using it for the last 14 years
3341679 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3341680 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3341681 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3341682 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3341683 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3341684 zelfs indien de staking vandaag afloopt zal het nog enkele dagen duren vooraleer de koffers opnieuw bij hun eigenaars zullen zijn
3341685 de mensen moeten zich geen zorgen maken hoewel het lang zal duren want het is een gigantische hoeveelheid die gesorteerd en gecontroleerd moet worden
3341686 het is in principe altijd mogelijk om bagage van de band te halen die van iemand anders is maar er staan zichtbare en onzichtbare cameras en er is meer veiligheidspersoneel dan normaal
3341687 we hebben al veel bijgeleerd in een stakingssituatie als deze moet je kunnen evolueren uit de fouten van gisteren moet je leren voor vandaag
3341688 ik heb hem leren kennen als een hardwerkende professional en een bijzonder sympathieke man
3341689 de keizerlijke natie legt de wapens neer voor de propaganda van de vijand zonder alles in het werk te stellen waartoe ze in staat is
3341690 ik had nooit een dergelijke lethargie verwacht van de leiders van het land of van het volk
3341691 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3341692 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3341693 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3341694 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3341695 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3341696 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england

3341700 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3341701 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3341702 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3341703 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3341704 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3341705 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective

3341714 then they have the audacity to treat this man as if hes a piece of meat and taser him with electrical jolts to his body and then thats not enough they kick three times to the torso
3341715 ive seen nothing to justify the actions of these officers
3341716 the fact that deputy tollison took his closed fist and struck the suspect in the face 13 times in my opinion was excessive
3341717 you sit there and count methodically the punches and you see law enforcement not stopping one of their own i think that is appalling
3341718 grave concern about this young man being held and beaten i think if youre holding him and allowing someone else to beat him youre a part of this process i think if youre standing by as an officer and youre watching a brutal kicking of a citizen that you have to be part of that process
3341719 must stay in place until these basic elements of democratic society are met
3341720 our fight is simply to protect our clients intellectual property rights for the day that they may be allowed to sell their product when and if that happens is not our issue
3341721 is clear and consistent and that regardless green holds no policymaking role in the campaign
3341722 i never encountered him advocating for lifting the embargo or travel restrictions claver carone said noting that a member of congress would likely have alerted him if green had worked the issue

3341736 were going to continue our peaceful struggle for the return of the president
3341737 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3341738 i pierced it the host with a rusty nail i hope jesuss tetanus shots are up to date and then i simply threw it in the trash
3341739 ill keep the students busy and post on my blog
3341740 im just finding the old boy pope benedict xvi increasingly irrelevant as he continues his reactionary slide into medieval thinking more and more its like hearing reports of what some random homeless man in a philadelphia subway station ranted about
3341741 i dare you to look at it and not have wildly inappropriate thoughts skitter through your brain
3341742 thieves broke into st michael the archangel in georgetown last weekend tore the tabernacle from the wall took it outside and threw it on the ground communion wafers were scattered around and a chalice and monstrance were stolen the church has been defiled and has been closed to worship
3341743 designed to meet the needs of the public and help make communities safer
3341744 continuing to build public confidence in policing in areas where there has traditionally been a lack of community support and managing the impact of a tighter police budget on the delivery of frontline policing services are some of the very real challenges that we face
3341745 another challenge is what is now seen as the final piece in the policing jigsaw the devolution of policing and justice
3341746 the spectre of times past had also reared its ugly head
3341747 for the first time in a long time in the last year the people of northern ireland witnessed terrorist attacks on police officers by those who have nothing to offer our society
3341748 in their delusion terrorists must not be allowed to undermine the genuine progress that has been made and i trust that all those who want to live in a future that bears no resemblance to the past will unite to deny the dissidents any foothold in the present
3341749 interessante aber in manchen punkten nicht zu ende gedachte diskussionsgrundlage
3341750 so agiert die spd in einigen punkten wie bei der nderung der bauordnung viel zu z gerlich in anderen punkten wie bei der vorschrift bestimmter antriebstechnologien f r fahrzeuge des landes l uft sie gefahr ber das ziel hinaus zu schie en und l sst m gliche technologische entwicklungsfortschritte unber cksichtigt wir gr ne w rden gerne endlich in regierungsverantwortung die energiewende nicht nur aus dem parlament sondern auch aus der regierung heraus umsetzen die spd sollte ihre energie vor allem in die herstellung ihrer innerparteilichen geschlossenheit investieren das beschleunigt am ende auch die gr ne energiewende
3341751 die spd will lediglich den kommunen eine rechtssichere entscheidungsfreiheit beispielsweise f r solarsatzungen wie diejenige der stadt marburg geben ziel gr ner politik ist es den gemeinden dar ber hinaus die freiheit zu geben den passivhausstandard in bebauungspl nen zur pflicht erkl ren
3341752 dar ber hinaus fehlen im vorgelegten gesetzentwurf eine ganze reihe gr ner forderungen ohne die die energiewende in hessen unvollst ndig bleiben w rde so k nnte im energiegesetz die klimaneutrale durchf hrung von flugreisen genauso festgeschrieben werden wie die einrichtung einer landeseigenen energie und klimaschutzagentur und der aufbau eines energieeffizienzfonds durch die verabschiedung eines erneuerbaren w rmegesetzes das f r alle geb udearten insbesondere auch altbauten gilt w rde dar ber hinaus das weitgehend zahnlose w rmegesetz auf bundesebene sinnvoll erg nzt werden
3341753 das bundesumweltministerium orientiert sich nach wie vor an dem beschluss des deutschen bundestages vom 07 juni 2002 danach kommt nur ein sanfter ausbau der donau in betracht also flussregulierende ma nahmen ohne neue staustufen
3341754 der freistaat bayern hat sich im rahmen des abgeschlossenen raumordnungsverfahrens weder mit der ffh vertr glichkeit des staustufenbaus noch mit den anforderungen der eu wasserrahmenrichtlinie auseinandergesetzt zudem fehlt eine hinreichend konkrete aussage zu den hydrologischen ver nderungen einschlie lich der grundwasserverh ltnisse ungekl rt sind auch m gliche negative auswirkungen auf das naturschutzgro vorhaben an der isarm ndung das in den jahren 1989 bis 2001 mit ber sieben millionen euro durch das bundesumweltministerium gef rdert wurde
3341755 ich werde gro en wert darauf legen dass die weiteren planungsschritte nunmehr kologisch umfassend und damit regelkonform sowie transparent durchgef hrt werden

3341783 we are dismayed over what looks like an unnecessary and deliberate delay in setting her free
3341784 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

3341881 carol black has alarmingly spent the past two decades elegantly shimmying from quango to quango or so greedily collecting massive fiscal remuneration for effectively doing relatively nothing for the orthodox medical community except of course competently acting as a readily available rubber stamp for the sordid whims and despotic caprices of the institutionally racist general medical council the time is therefore categorically ripe for this self proclaimed wonderwoman of her profession to be metaphorically dragged by her scarily receding hairline right onto the exceptionally wobbly precipice of a massively gaping cesspit from where she should be firmly advised that there is far much more to the academy of royal medical colleges than waltzing around from luncheon to luncheon looking like the next best thing to lord peter mandelson in glamorous drag gear in my exceedingly humble opinion miss carol black remains a monumental regulatory disgrace par excellence while elizabeth paice plus gillian needham should equally bow their gossipy little heads in perpetual human shame for failing to adopt a much more proportionate approach to such highly deserved criticism blemishless carol black craftily stood by as graeme robertson dawson catto literally got away with murder the very same carol black daintily looked the other way as countless medical doctors from ethnic minority communities were being consistently demonized and comprehensively bastardized by the outrageously ruthless gmc good old carol black has also never ever had the solid moral fibre to boldly get up and publicly condemn the profound professional ethnic cleansing which is currently going on in the uk medical profession even as we speak this very damn hour yet despite all of this our obnoxiously scandalous carol black still has the flipping excrementous and scatological gumption to daringly orchestrate a campaign of diabolical regulatory terror against those qualified medical doctors who dare hold her to account for her exceptionally alarming incompetencies and oblivious administrative tomfoolery enough is enough we must all publicly challenge carol black to ethically submit full account of her stewardship for due public scrutiny as in my personal opinion she is a bloody waste of money and a serious danger to the public i hereby call upon all well meaning medical doctors in the united kingdom to formally boycott all public events where carol black is listed as a speaker or guest of honour with immediate effect until she fully steps down from the academy of royal medical colleges and all other professional medical bodies

3341966 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3341967 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3341968 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3341969 you are hereby directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate to the 2008 democratic national convention in light of these comments
3341970 isnt there a right to free speech isnt this right in line with our time honored tradition with the dems
3341971 these intimidation tactics have a chilling effect on people feeling comfortable speaking up
3341972 we wanted to explore with ms millstone the possibility of her voluntarily resigning her position
3341973 its inevitable within a party of this size that there will be different views about the merits of the candidates that the parties put forward
3341974 priority to ensure ms millstones delegate status was not in jeopardy
3341975 were getting too near the convention and shes refused to come in
3341976 it makes me want to now really be even louder about issues and concerns that before i was willing to look the other way
3341977 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3341978 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3341979 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3341980 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3341981 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3341982 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3341983 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3341984 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3341985 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3341986 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3341987 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3341988 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3341989 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3341990 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3341991 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3342011 though their skin remains brown i hope their souls will soon be white
3342012 the trouble with te kotahi a tuhoe and all of that who have been running around it they have been funded by the state by crown forest rental trust and all of that but theyre not properly elected people you cant keep up with them because of the funding hence theyve been able to hop in the middle and away they go and theyre recognised by the government this mandate process is thick as thieves on the road its worse than mugabe
3342013 if we want our political issues addressed and resolutions sought we have no choice but to follow the process that the crown has in place its not as if there is another vendor down the road that is dealing with treaty of waitangi claims
3342014 the main finding was that it could be done within a community no other diabetes prevention strategy has been aimed through the community the big one in america was one on one individualised advice but this one was for the whole family for the whole community
3342015 if theyve been vaccinated against hepatitis b thats it they dont need to worry they dont need more tests they dont need boosters and theyre ok but would they please turn their minds to making sure babies get protected
3342016 the companies that do mussel spat gathering have been told that should they come into the region of te rarawa south of the waipapakauri ramp that they will be confronted by the hapu
3342017 the maori party will dice with the devil basically by saying theyre happy to go into coalition with them i think thats really dangerous stance they are prepared to make and im not sure why they are prepared to jeopardise the maori seats
3342018 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3342019 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3342020 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3342021 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3342022 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3342023 now we need to move on and swim fast theres a lot of fast swimmers i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing
3342024 im happy to get the first race jitters sort of out
3342025 the first race is probably one of the most important ones to get it out of your system
3342026 i want to hear what you think a blog is what characteristics define it is the definition changing over time

3342029 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
3342030 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
3342031 we couldnt wait to get this started were sick of practice
3342032 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3342033 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offence known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3342034 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3342035 four years ago in athens lezak surprisingly failed to get out of the 100 free prelims eamon sullivan of australia who broke the world record on the relays leadoff leg was fastest of all 47 80
3342036 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3342037 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead

3342041 i think it is due to the weather conditions the hot humid weather and rain i think from today there will be more spectators in the stadiums the tickets are sold out thats correct
3342042 i need a ticket for track and field ive been doing this for three days
3342043 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv

3342065 as with any business acquisition there will be some impact on employees weve worked really hard to keep any terminations to an absolute minimum
3342066 due to the highly competitive nature of the online advertising industry the client has requested anonymity
3342067 this signifies to us a little counter intuitive trend a return to pre roll
3342068 there was a huge user backlash against it studies show its effective but there really was a negative connotation in the marketplace
3342069 they can get more value out of something they already spent money on a tv commercial can be leveraged
3342070 the agencies focus on what users want becomes less important when the resources are limited
3342071 when you have a limited budget and you need strong impact you basically spend the money on what works not necessarily on the latest new fun and user friendly ad idea
3342072 the most popular format is and always has been pre roll
3342073 there was a lot of hype around the overlay ad format

3342076 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3342077 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3342078 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3342079 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3342080 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3342081 asset management firms processing high data volumes and spread across the globe need highly available real time data access and analysis to support better decision making our customers can now depend on us for innovative solutions in grid computing and extreme transaction processing xtp which is the need of the hour the alliance will strengthen our off shore and near shore based delivery and support teams
3342082 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3342083 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3342084 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3342085 why arent you watching this and if you are why arent we dishing about it
3342086 oh we were online and we did a video chat and traded photos via im
3342087 we kind of thought there was a void in this area
3342088 as far as the fire service is concerned and even the ems people there really is nothing like that locally
3342089 were just a social club that enjoys two things firefighting and riding motorcycles
3342090 it could range from helping out with household bills helping out with college
3342091 i am 41 years old and i have been waiting 21 years for this day
3342092 when they got softball in the olympics for the first time my eyes got wide everybody started dreaming and dreaming
3342093 it has been tough we kept telling each other to keep going come on we have to do it we tried we failed we tried we failed and then we made it finally
3342094 never has a women team come to the olympics in any sport in
3342095 we were the first one never had women of a team sport carry the flag and we gained that right to do that
3342096 we came from nothing six years ago and were in the olympics
3342097 i feel bad but i would say this is not the last time there is still a long way to go
3342098 hopefully softball is going to get back and we are going to play them u s again and we are going to be here jumping between those lines hopefully it is going to be like that again
3342099 a lot of people are saying usain and tyson are very strong finishers but if i get out in front of them no matter how they are finishing they wont even close on me
3342100 i did some great things in practice for the past couple of weeks
3342101 this is the first time ive seen my coach so excited so all i have to do is go there and just be like i was in the last two races and i do it
3342102 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since i have been here they have tested me four times and took blood a lot of blood
3342103 they are taking so much blood we are going to be very weak before the finals of the 100 metres
3342104 and i am almost sure i might be tested tomorrow
3342105 i dont know about anybody else but they are really down on my case and my team mate michael frater and usain
3342106 they expect us to be first and second a world record and stuff like that
3342107 unfortunately ive only ever been once to togo when i was very little because my mother wanted to present me to my grandmother
3342108 but now i think i have a very good reason to go
3342109 i thought maybe 2 07 would be okay for the semi final but they swam very quickly in the heats so i swam faster too but at the end i saved my power
3342110 its only a heat i probably took it out a little slower than i usually would have and didnt put in as much effort as i should have knowing how fast heats have been going here
3342111 im not surprised what the other girls have gone the way everyone is swimming here i didnt do myself any favours going out so slow i dont know what im capable of the closer i can get to my best the happier ill be
3342112 i really want to get a gold medal i want to show him how much i appreciate him
3342113 when i heard the news in december i was really worried about him
3342114 its a limited exclusive so if i were to try to make a ps3 or wiiware version of the game i would have to wait a little bit
3342115 playstation 3 might happen in the future whats going to definitely happen this year is a pc release the only reason thats not out right now is that i wanted to focus on one platform at a time
3342116 wiiware is not going to happen for this game because the model is just not right like braid is too big of a game to be downloadable on wiiware and stored on someones wii
3342117 im not going to do a sequel to braid i dont care how many copies it sells
3342118 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3342119 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3342120 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3342121 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3342122 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
3342123 our gameplay experiences with the ati radeon hd 4870 x2 were phenomenal especially once we raised the antialiasing setting to high levels who would have thought wed ever be seeing oblivion at 2560 1600 with 24x aa this means you can load up old games and set crazy high aa settings amd deserves huge kudos for really kicking aa up a notch
3342124 is able to run away from nvidias geforce gtx 280 1gb card handily our various game tests proved this crysis call of duty 4 and grid showed big gains for amds new card at resolutions 2 048 x 1 536 and 2 560 x 1 600

3342127 they already call me paris hilton so now i want to be her everything lips breasts and all the rest
3342128 a wish to look like somebody else and make it happen can be seen as a mental disorder
3342129 too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3342130 previous efforts have shown this negative refraction effect using microwaves a wavelength far longer than humans can see the new materials instead work at wavelengths around those used in the telecommunications industry much nearer to the visible part of the spectrum

3342132 for its law firms gm sets a target of 20 percent minority lawyers and 33 percent women lawyers of the total number of lawyers working on gm matters per firm it hires
3342133 they didnt throw much drop back pass so its a big difference
3342134 they didnt have any protections i mean they mainly had about one protection
3342135 nah its like the sky is blue or the sky is green difference
3342136 weve thrown a lot at them this first week and threw some more at them today
3342137 now we can go back and start going over stuff
3342138 if you had seen those holes youd understand on the play following his long touchdown run after two extra point kicks smith hit a trap play over the right side got to the sideline and sprinted 69 yards before being hauled down by dallas washington and matt harris
3342139 i was kind of mad at myself i didnt score on that second one
3342140 thats something i worked on this summer and i do feel like im faster
3342141 its a major loss just because the reps he had been getting
3342142 its nothing major like a seasonending thing so well see how fast he can get back
3342143 when we took that break and we came back we had that intensity we should have started with
3342144 you always want your players to start fast and we didnt and their offense came out rolling
3342145 weve been rotating and trying to get him a good look because hes a good player
3342146 were trying to get him a decent look with the ones so he can be ready to go too
3342147 i just think wades done a real good job and deserves to get some time with the ones
3342148 they always want to create competition right now its two a days and theyre trying to get everybody good reps
3342149 my deal is just to come out here every day and go hard and leave it all out here when im done
3342150 we ran a lot of different things out there today
3342151 but then i knew that if i did it in high school i could do it up here
3342152 we used him like johnny rodgers was used at nebraska
3342153 ive coached five guys that have gone to the nfl in the last two years
3342154 ive got to lean my big shoulders quite a bit
3342155 his pad level is getting better his ball security is getting better and thats a big back thats a big man and i think hell go in and feel good about the way he performed today thatll help his confidence
3342156 hes big and you like to have a big guy that can run downhill
3342157 mike smith has been a great leader and hes helping me get used to it
3342158 he can actually play quarterback and he can throw the ball too
3342159 hes like mcfadden in a way and he can do so many things
3342160 but well see if he ever gets that tenacity mcfadden had
3342161 every time i think about it my heart starts pounding real hard
3342162 matts been solid and hes had a really good start to camp
3342163 we want him to sustain the effort energy commitment and determination hes shown in the first two weeks
3342164 there was certainly a lot of discussion and thought on my part before i decided if marcus could play professional football and be in drug court
3342165 the bears management came and met with me personally before the draft and they continue to give me regular updates on marcus progress
3342166 we want to make it clear that matt was not in possession of any drugs but that there were drugs in the vehicle and were located in the closest proximity to matt he does not claim any responsibility for the drugs
3342167 we got behind by 15 but we pressured them and we won in overtime
3342168 we have a nice bond because he played football at louisville with my coach ty scroggins
3342169 i want to commit as soon as possible so i dont have a lot of stress about recruiting during the season
3342170 pretty much whats going to help me choose a school is if i can get along with the coach not so much on the field but more so off the field
3342171 they dont have too many linebackers so i could come in and get some playing time and hopefully in the future go to the nfl johnson told wilson he could be used multiple ways at arkansas
3342172 he said if i come down there ill be playing like a dpr a designated pass rusher
3342173 some downs i would be a linebacker or defensive end and some downs i would be in coverage
3342174 i want to be an entrepreneur later on in life
3342175 stanford nebraska and arkansas are probably my top three as far as going away for school
3342176 locally my top three are tulane smu i consider them local because of the quick hour flight and southern miss
3342177 i guess it was pretty cool being that guy people were talking about
3342178 i was named to the local newspapers top 25 blue chippers in the state
3342179 this years class reveals an empowered group of consumers from their purchasing decisions and media consumption to their pull at the polls this college consumer is clearly in control and showing their strength in numbers
3342180 perception of social responsibility remains critical to garnering college students brand loyalty in current collegiate environment it is very cool to be good brands who enable college students to reflect their own social responsibility have an advantage
3342181 well bobby petrino did say sunday that the defense came back in the scrimmages second half
3342182 probably after the break we got ourselves going a little bit more but the thing is we didnt execute as well as we wish we would have
3342183 this is not a very mentally tough football team on our side of the ball
3342184 we were a little concerned with them early in camp and they came out with those live bullets and ran hard and looked good
3342185 we missed a couple of big plays for touchdowns that we cant have happen
3342186 you only get so many plays in a game where you get that big chance to score and we missed a couple of those
3342187 its like the sky is blue or the sky is green difference
3342188 i have a passion for landscape and i have never seen one improved by a billboard where every prospect pleases man is at his vilest when he erects a billboard
3342189 caused by strong updrafts that suspended raindrops in the chilly upper atmosphere until they froze
3342190 because i think thats the type of running back i am
3342191 i worked on dont try to beat everybody with your speed
3342192 hes a guy that is built low to the ground
3342193 they have to take the approach that you are going to play and compete
3342194 thats the only way they are going to get better
3342195 i think its a lot more pressure because if i want to play ive got to compete that much more
3342196 its a competition for me to play against that many players as opposed to other cats
3342197 askew is starting to catch our eye a little bit
3342198 my coach told me i have a shot at playing
3342199 hes going to put some weight on and is going to be a real big force on the defensive line
3342200 if they want me to redshirt then ill have to go along with that decision
3342201 but what id like to do is hopefully make an impact in the running game hopefully complement caseys passing
3342202 will in arkansas defensive revision jack will mostly replace sam which was one of the thinnest positions on the team and got thinner when strongside linebacker freddy burton was suspended for two games for off field issues
3342203 we needed to name it something different from our sam linebacker because we still have some of our sam stuff in our package
3342204 we use that jack term in some of our other packages and shoot its a common name jack
3342205 its like a linebacker slash safety because im in the box most of the time
3342206 you have to learn a lot because you have to know your checks and where to line up
3342207 youve got to have a guy that can play the game not only as a linebacker but as a safety type a hybrid safety is what i keep calling it
3342208 its still a 4 3 package its no more or no less we do the same things with that body that we did in the spring with an outside linebacker
3342209 we just ended up putting a guy in there because with the depth situation we felt those guys fit well there
3342210 youve got to bring it when youre taking on them blocks because its linemen and stuff
3342211 you cant be too small and play this position you know im kind of middle ways to being a linebacker so ive got some size
3342212 its something different but i like it it gives me a better chance to make more plays up front robinson said the jack position is still a work in progress especially with the short preparation time and number of candidates for the job
3342213 youre seeing us each day move some guy around just to see if we can still find that guy and i think were getting closer
3342214 i think the fact that they can play a lot of different positions is only going to help us in the long run
3342215 at our two inside linebacker positions its kind of a wait and see
3342216 we do have a temporary setback with burton not being there with wendel not being there with them not being there we are developing more depth
3342217 those guys who are practicing and are developing depth they have to understand theyre not just there to be a backup but theyre striving to be a starter
3342218 i cant just make them appear i think i have a solid group of guys they love to work hard they enjoy competing
3342219 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
3342220 as kids we could run in one house in the front door and go out the back door with a sweet potato pie the community was a village raising all the kids
3342221 so i thought if the kids could somehow approach their new neighbors
3342222 and let the neighbors know they were actually interested in them the kids and the neighbors could meet one another its all about building community
3342223 when you say hi to people it takes you out of your comfort zone
3342224 a couple of years ago the afghan government wanted to develop a ranger like or a special operations like structure in the military
3342225 the ana were large and laborious the ana is a good army its a developing army but they need a smaller more agile flexible force and so the commandos were the solution
3342226 signal is probably one of the most difficult things to teach the afghan recruits and a lot of it goes back to previous education
3342227 its difficult to explain the background of how a radio works so we try to cut a lot of theory out of it and just take it to practical application this is how it works and this is how you should make it work
3342228 guys come in and you got lumps of clay they really dont know a lot about training and light infantry tactics
3342229 its kind of you tear them down and build them up again its the same thing theres a lot of similarities between what we experience in ranger school in the united states and what theyre experiencing here in commando school
3342230 we issue them uniforms boots helmets weapons vehicles radios everything that theyre going to need
3342231 all of this stuff here will all redeploy with them when they go
3342232 you cant expect them to do the job we want them to do without having the right tools
3342233 i want to change the old policy ill go to america ill learn special training and come back here where i will teach my junior officers in the future
3342234 it will help change my country my army everything will be better
3342235 commando forces are like we say the jewel of the army
3342236 its precious forces for the afghan national army we have the best training we have the best equipment and we can conduct dangerous missions
3342237 id say the best way to describe them is theyre steadfast in their improvement theyre dedicated we really do see them as afghani patriots and i think the way ahead is pretty bright their heart is in the right place
3342238 we are doing operations in four different provinces around here
3342239 as soon as we get word that were needed we can get ready in 20 to 25 minutes and can stop any kind of bad activities
3342240 and i think thats why the commandos are so important
3342241 they are afghans they understand the country they understand the history they can interact with the population in a way that no outsider ever could
3342242 we may hide it in a wall or something in our own home back in the united states
3342243 the afghans know they wouldnt hide it in their house theyd keep it away because wed find it in their house so they understand the customs the way people actually do things and it assists us in our planning
3342244 insurgency and counter insurgency is an intimate struggle in the nation and ultimately it has to be an afghan fight
3342245 you need to feed them you need to resupply them you need to give them equipment you need to give them mobility cars trucks helicopters
3342246 thats the first time ive written a song like that from the point of view of the hopeless romantic
3342247 i think the words resonate with people who find something in their own life that relates to it
3342248 my last album chemical sunsets had a fairly busy rock sound and the new one is stripped right back and that really seems to connect with people maybe its because they can hear the lyrics
3342249 eu sou empregado do clube e cumpro ordens nos reunimos para ver qual era a prioridade

3342257 when we first drove out here we were told we should organize the three democrats out here and make sure we get all three of them
3342258 but as weve come here weve noticed there are a lot of republicans who want permission to vote for obama and a lot of people who are very upset with the way the countrys going
3342259 the strength of this they know who they are they know what the local issues are they know the local things going on so they can speak to their fellow voters and also in a sense be almost character witnesses for sen obama and build support that way
3342260 i think they read too much into the state turning blue
3342261 what you have is some changing demographics but most of it is just the republican brand name being in the trash can enabling wide awake democrats to take advantage of that and in virginia theyve done that
3342262 weve got people coming in the door as they are today weve got headquarters all over the state folks knocking on doors we dont have enough bumper stickers we cant keep them in stock
3342263 thats a good indicator a good grassroots indicator things look good in virginia
3342264 we usually think of a down ticket effect when we talk about coattails but mark warners advantages over jim gilmore are so huge that we could see the reverse coattails effect where the senate candidate is actually lifting up the presidential nominee on the ballot at the same time
3342265 the whole exercise was to make sure that the mill would remain open even though we all know its going to come with tough and bold measures because we cannot operate the way it is now
3342266 that significant investment is anywhere from 60 million to 150 million

3342306 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3342307 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3342308 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3342309 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3342310 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3342311 now we need to move on and swim fast theres a lot of fast swimmers i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing
3342312 our strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2008 represents our eleventh consecutive quarter of year over year sales growth
3342313 particularly satisfying is the nearly doubling of our quarterly profit on the eve of expanding our business model into eleven new states following the recently announced purchase of the assets of photomedex surgical services pss a division of photomedex inc
3342314 on august 8 2008 we closed the pss asset purchase the pss division recorded sales of 7 667 000 for the year ended december 31 2007 equal to 43 of emergents sales of 17 662 000 for the same period
3342315 we expect the division to be accretive to emergent groups earnings for 2008 and represent a large future growth opportunity
3342316 our confidence in our business and prospects is reinforced by our continued strong cash generation and demonstrated by the payment of a 0 30 per share cash dividend in january 2008 an increase of 50 over the prior year

3342322 these special fish are very valuable as they bring social economic and environmental benefits to local communities
3342323 their sensitivity and need for a good quality environment means we need to work together with our partners to address the complex factors affecting them he said
3342324 the better sea trout and salmon fisheries strategy will help us focus our work over the next decade to be more efficient and effective its not just about us we need everyone with an interest in our rivers to work in partnership to help bring more sea trout and salmon into more rivers bringing more benefit
3342325 we have been consulted at all stages during the evolution of the strategy which is an excellent example of the environment agency involving partners in a major project
3342326 it is fitting that another partnership the blachford fish pass on the river yealm should be chosen for lord smith to launch the strategy

3342345 as a part of the start b 1s were classified as no longer nuclear capable and we were not authorized to use the exterior of the aircraft to mount pods
3342346 we had to get approval to mount the pods on the exterior of the aircraft
3342347 in todays fight we are most often employed in a close air support role from medium altitude
3342348 in that capacity a sniper equipped b 1 is an exponential increase in combat capability
3342349 the big difference with radar is only large objects like buildings are visible
3342350 we could see buildings and vehicles but not people also radar is a picture in time whereas the pod provides us with real time streaming video which enhances our capability
3342351 now the guys on the ground can see the video provided by the pod at the same time as us and thats something weve never been able to do before
3342352 the pod also gives us immediate bomb damage assessment whereas before any assessment had to come from someone on the ground
3342353 the training requirement was significant because it took place during our regular spin up time prior to the deployment
3342354 for aircrew the training involved approximately 10 to 12 hours of academics three flights for wsos and two flights for pilots when youre talking 50 crewmembers flying the same three aircraft this is a challenge
3342355 training plays a critical role in fielding a new subsystem like the sniper pod
3342356 avionics and weapons systems technicians attend a school in florida to learn how to maintain repair and up and download the pod and its supporting pylon
3342357 support equipment includes consolidated tool kits specialized adapters for bomb loaders and support dollies
3342358 additionally several supply kit items required modification in order to support this new critical capability
3342359 the sniper pod itself may have made it into theater after a two day flight from home station but hundreds of maintenance and logistics personnel spent many months behind the scenes to make it happen
3342360 the aircraft went to davis monthan air force base ariz for modification and then to ellsworth afb where the aircrew and maintenance personnel got to train with them
3342361 its all very new to us but with the few flights weve had its performed very well
3342362 sniper atp brings an amazing new capability to the already amazing b 1
3342363 it increases the speed and accuracy with which the aircrew and the joint tactical air controllers can execute the find fix track target portion of the kill chain

3342390 when i discovered that over 500 000 people had downloaded the corporation i had mixed feelings as a filmmaker and activist one of my goals is to reach the largest possible audience so from that perspective its an astounding success
3342391 i agree that the vast majority of those who downloaded the corporation if they didnt also see it in a theatre or buy the dvd would have been and may still be willing to pay a bit toward the production costs but there was just no mechanism for them to do it
3342392 the corporation was a huge undertaking over two hundred people helped make the film the dvd and website and worked on the outreach campaign over a period of 8 years

3342462 que los responsables pol ticos pueden desbloquear la situaci n
3342463 con la autoridad de alguien que ha superado tantos obst culos en su vida el presidente lula puede convencerlos
3342464 si retomamos r pidamente las discusiones es probable que continuemos donde nos quedamos pero si la reanudaci n se produce dentro de dos o tres a os me temo que nuevos c lculos y reflejos proteccionistas tengan tiempo de poner en cuesti n todo lo logrado
3342465 tengo muchas dudas por ejemplo sobre el acuerdo alcanzado acerca del banano
3342466 no pele en ginebra por un millardo de m s o de menos
3342467 estamos convencidos de que el sistema multilateral es esencial en el mundo de hoy y que los acuerdos bilaterales no son una buena soluci n la omc organizaci n mundial de comercio tiene sus defectos pero funciona bastante bien
3342468 respetar las reservas que ya han sido realizadas a trav s de agencias de viajes en internet
3342469 ryanair tiene la libertad de organizar su pol tica de reservas o su pol tica empresarial como quiera pero hay que garantizar que lo hace de manera transparente

3342471 estamos viendo la cobertura de posiciones cortas en el valor y el movimiento se ve amplificado por el momento de mercado con rdenes muy profesionales que amplifican la tendencia

3342480 el frente com n que han montado los partidos catalanes ha de servir no para defender intereses partidistas sino para defender el conjunto de la sociedad catalana para ir todos en la misma direcci n
3342481 la petici n de una nueva financiaci n no es un tema de los partidos del parlament o de los pol ticos es una cuesti n que importa a toda la sociedad catalana y esto lo ha de entender el gobierno espa ol
3342482 cuando es toda catalu a la que est pidiendo algo desde el gobierno se han de plantear si no tienen que responder

3342508 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it

3342511 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3342512 our family and rebeccas good friends are hugely behind this project its wonderful to work with a remarkable organization like the mood disorders association when they see a need they roll up their sleeves and make it happen when everything is done and touched by fire opens rebeccas work will be there and in so many important ways shell be there too this is a legacy of hope and accomplishment and overcoming the demons as dozens of ontario artists will proudly show us all

3342515 pressure is a privilege lessons ive learned from life and the battle of the sexes
3342516 that match taught me a lot dealing with the media and the attention and pressure and what it stood for the symbolism of the womens movement
3342517 its a fun read it will take you an hour and half its quick

3342523 if anybody knew bobby riggs he didnt want to lose a bet
3342524 so many people came up it was as if mick jagger was on the stage

3342526 if there is one lesson to learn from the boomer generation it is that age is just a number and old is not old anymore
3342527 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3342528 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3342529 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3342530 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3342531 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3342532 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3342533 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter
3342534 pressure is a privilege lessons ive learned from life and the battle of the sexes
3342535 that match taught me a lot dealing with the media and the attention and pressure and what it stood for the symbolism of the womens movement

3342546 who gives me the strength and support to keep living the dream
3342547 over the last two weeks how often have you been bothered by the following problem thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way
3342548 it is worrying that despite improvements in cancer care a substantial number of patients feel they would be better off dead
3342549 we know that depression is common in patients who have cancer but it is often missed pain is also a big problem treating patients symptoms as well as their disease might improve and even save their lives
3342550 it is normal to experience distress after a cancer diagnosis but for some patients emotional distress or depression becomes a problem in itself and may lead to suicidal thoughts cancer specialists and gps can provide treatment with the help of psychiatrists if necessary
3342551 this report is a welcome means of raising awareness of older people and mental health an issue which is all too often mis diagnosed and left untreated
3342552 general practitioners have a key role to play in more effectively pinpointing possible depression as patients present themselves
3342553 help the aged continues to be concerned at the worryingly high levels of age discrimination within health services something which the charitys just equal treatment campaign has highlighted
3342554 mental health issues should not be taboo subjects more understanding of the treatable nature of conditions such as depression is urgently needed no older person should ever lack support or help with mental health issues
3342555 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3342556 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3342557 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3342558 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3342559 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3342560 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3342561 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3342562 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3342563 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3342564 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3342565 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3342566 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3342567 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3342568 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3342569 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3342570 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3342571 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3342572 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position
3342573 we dont want to set this precedent but this is a unique case that fans seem to have taken to their hearts
3342574 we agreed a clause in his contract that would see matty receive 50 of his agreed weekly pay when he was injured
3342575 the club have agreed to forgo that clause and pay him his full amount but that still leaves him well short
3342576 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3342577 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3342578 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3342579 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3342580 girls now keep asking for a kiss after every show on my tour i stay behind to do an autograph signing but about a dozen women will want a snog
3342581 i just sweetly say no thank you if i kissed everybody who asked id probably go away with something i dont really want
3342582 raising bob costas is memorizing sports trivia good for the brain
3342583 every thing is worth what it will fetch so probably every mental pursuit takes its reality and worth from the ardour of the pursuer
3342584 it means you like to do something intensely and youre more likely to be successful in life
3342585 i dont think theres any benefit as far as learning to learn because thats been exploded
3342586 we will spend less than we did last year and that is a rarity in government
3342587 were going to be going backwards as far as im concerned
3342588 the devil and the other demons were indeed created naturally good by god but they became evil by their own doing
3342589 there is no repentance for the angels after their fall just as there is no repentance for men after death
3342590 the reason the son of god appeared was to destroy the works of the devil
3342591 if it is by the spirit of god that i cast out demons then the kingdom of god has come upon you
3342592 i am not asking you to take them out of the world but i ask you to protect them from the evil one
3342593 a murderer from the beginning a liar and the father of lies
3342594 we know that anyone born of god does not sin but he who was born of god keeps him and the evil one does not touch him we know that we are of god and the whole world is in the power of the evil one
3342595 we know that in everything god works for good with those who love him

3342600 volver n las asambleas en distintos lugares del pa s como una forma de protesta
3342601 si volver an las protestas dentro de la producci n agropecuaria porque hay malestar
3342602 en definitiva luego de la derogaci n de la 125 nosotros est bamos convencidos de que iban a venir soluciones concretas
3342603 el tema del trigo es grave hay trigo y no se lo puede vender se est ofreciendo a cerca de 500 pesos cuando el a o pasado lo vend amos a 700 pesos para que tengan una idea y no me digan que el pan no aument igual pas con la carne el criador no puede vender el ternero a m s de 3 pesos con est merma de precios y est suba de los costos no hay producci n que aguante ac nos vamos a quedar sin carne sin leche sin trigo
3342604 m s all de la derogaci n ac existen otros problemas concretos con la carne el gran problema que hay como no alcanza la carne que hace la secretar a de comercio exterior incentiva la producci n de terneras y vaquillonas y el problema lo vamos a tener dentro de algunos a os cuando tengamos que reponer a la futura madre no nos quedan pr cticamente hembras para reponer
3342605 lo que estamos diciendo es que est pol tica econ mica nos lleva a la destrucci n y no beneficia a nadie el tema es que no exportamos nos encerramos en el mercado interno y porque nos pagan cada vez menos a los productores el consumidor cada vez va a pagar m s y en productor va a cobrar cada vez menos
3342606 nos reunimos hoy y seguro que las asambleas van a volver el 23 de agosto hay una asamblea grande en olavaria vuelven porque el productor tienen que manifestarse de alguna manera y veremos en la reuni n de la comisi n de enlace como sigue el tema

3342609 part of the stipulation is that the defendant acknowledges that he was in fact the individual who committed those murders
3342610 in this particular situation mr boggs attempted suicide shortly after the incident in question which has rendered him incapacitated physically he cant feed himself he cant bathe himself or clothe himself
3342611 i know that i am satisfied with the outcome because based on the facts and circumstances of the defendants illness this is absolutely the best we could have done
3342612 if they can come together and solve some of these issues and put a plan together as the energy producing sector of the united states then hopefully they can lead the way on the national level
3342613 it has raised some issues and were trying to address those
3342614 i dont want to be sending the wrong message a second time
3342615 my driving force is i have 370 000 customers who come to blue mountain to ski and enjoy it and i have more than 1 000 employees who work here during the season
3342616 but i think there are certain places that ought to be off limits because they are such important areas and the kittatinny is one
3342617 to put a turbine on the kittatinny ridge at this point would be knowingly putting one of these machines on one of the best known and most important bird migration and flight lines anywhere in north america
3342618 of all the possible appalachian ridges that could be used this is the worst selection of all
3342619 if the appalachian trail keeps getting chipped away at over its entire stretch eventually all those things add up to degrade the natural experience of the trail as a whole
3342620 everybody is going green and trying ways to produce energy with less pollution
3342621 right now im attempting to put a group together to help revise the bylaw and make something clear that we can wrap our arms round
3342622 we want to make sure its available to all the town and that theres total transparency
3342623 i havent even read the amendments im not on the mailing list
3342624 if the changes in these amendments are substantive i dont know that the town residents have been sufficiently informed and if they havent then the wishes expressed at the annual town meeting have not been addressed either way i theres a failure here
3342625 weve had nine public hearings with lots of publicity and basically no one came there was no citizen participation it became clear at a certain point that people expect you to do something and present them with the finished product the idea of more public hearings becomes absurd i think we should use the democratic process tonight regardless of procedure
3342626 with all due respect for what is overwhelmingly good work you do for this town
3342627 there have been no meetings where the public can give input how is it fair to ask people to vote on it
3342628 for me this is the most important part of the bylaw some people treat windmills like a toy this makes people look at what theyre building and makes them aware of what theyre doing
3342629 were trying to engineer this bylaw on the town floor
3342630 give me this in language that i can read and vote on its just not fair to us

3342632 a decision was issued by the court on friday and they found in the countys favor and denied the appeal
3342633 it means they found in our favor and we look forward to moving forward and starting construction
3342634 they could appeal that decision i suppose but that would be their decision to do that
3342635 each question as presented by the appellants will be answered in the negative and the decision of the planning commission will be upheld by the court
3342636 aes has repeatedly advised the planning commission that it intends to lease parcels in their entirety therefore no subdivision application is required under the mpc
3342637 properly applied for justified and considered and approved by the planning commission
3342638 based upon our review of this matter we do not find that the planning commission committed any error of law or abused its discretion in any manner
3342639 in addition the planning commission authored a report of findings and review of consistency evidencing a complete review of the application by the commission we therefore affirm the decision of the tioga county planning commissions approval of the aes armenia mountain wind llc request for modification and preliminary conditional approval of the land use application
3342640 based on this review new grange has indicated additional information will be developed to augment studies as required based on comments received from various involved ny state agencies
3342641 these agencies include department of environmental conservation department of public service and department of agriculture and markets
3342642 there is more information needed and i believe the wetland impact could be greater than originally anticipated
3342643 the public needs to know we are going to extreme means to protect the town
3342644 the supplemental report will be available for public review and written comments will be accepted within the 30 day period
3342645 if staff are working late employers should make sure they are either accompanied home or get into a taxi
3342646 we are not blaming any bar in particular but managers do have a responsibility to make sure staff are safe
3342647 incidents of this nature are extremely rare in this area
3342648 we have a dedicated inquiry team for both incidents while extra officers are patrolling the streets to provide a visible presence and offer reassurance to the local community
3342649 we are advising women to take sensible precautions such as avoiding walking alone at night and staying to well lit and well used areas
3342650 when you are going out go with friends make sure you let someone know where you are going who you are with and what time you are due to arrive i would urge everyone to be vigilant look after one another and report anything suspicious to us on 0845 33 00 247

3342719 the great teams get back to finals and win it and this just shows we are not a great team were just an average team in a lot of areas but its up to the manager and the rest of the staff to look at that we seem to be falling further behind these teams like real madrid

3342794 i didnt expect them to defend so much the germans looked like they might be playing for a draw but i cant say
3342795 the germans had a brief flurry of chances between the 24th and 27th minutes but their best chance came in first half injury time when simone laudehr headed renate lingors free kick and jon had to tip it onto the crossbar before it was cleared

3342902 traditionally when a company begins to feel the affects of an addict or alcoholics disruptive behavior the human resource department steps in and provides solutions for the employee
3342903 yet a crisis situation at the executive level falls outside the scope of human resource capabilities and therefore requires a unique approach to the intervention and recovery process

3342913 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3342914 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds

3342930 the whole social class issue between the rich in a town and the poor in a town or whether its you go to a better school or not so better school and the stereotype that goes along with that what this shows us is just because the rich kids are the rich kids doesnt make them evil or all the poor kids arent necessarily hoods and criminals

3342941 were arming our channel partners with new tools and insight so they can prepare their customers for the unknown unknowns the network threats that have yet to be exposed that they can never plan for
3342942 its always the unknown that scares us the most and that fear is only getting worse as more and more critical business information is flowing in and out of corporate networks and in and out of the computing cloud every network security tool fails at some point because it hasnt been programmed to look for the next new threat we see it every day and were aligning with channel partners around the world who understand the need to help customers plan for quick recovery by giving their network a fail safe memory
3342943 we specialize in delivering the industrys best security technologies such as bivio bluecat breach security trigeo and sourcefire to name a few
3342944 australian it security professionals are facing numerous challenges in regard to collecting relevant data for audit trails and regulatory compliance requirements adding solera networks to the mix and its ability to capture all network traffic at todays fastest network speeds for instant network recall is a natural fit to support the other solutions we deliver

3342946 connecting our 90 000 plus members with relevant documents in the wkb repository within seconds and then sharing that content with other forum members is our goal
3342947 the wkb shows promising capabilities that have already demonstrated great utility for example doctrinal content in army field manuals published in english arabic used in iraq or english pushto used in afghanistan can be difficult to discover access and understand using a traditional database approach the file sizes are also very large which could make finding relevant content a time consuming task on a low bandwidth network the metadata assigned to these types of documents and the fact that content can be discovered and viewed page by page without having to download the file allows discovery and use of only the relevant content bcks has the capability to store and manage content in 37 different languages
3342948 we knew we had to provide content discovery and access at the page level to be of any value to forward deployed soldiers and the dod da contractors and civilians who support them they have neither the bandwidth nor the time to download a large file only to discover its not what they wanted
3342949 the application program interface api developed by mark logic for the army is unique in that it parses and indexes content at the page level and applies discovery metadata based on the ddms and a bcks customized schema
3342950 visible accessible understandable trusted interoperable manageable and responsive to user needs via a service oriented architecture
3342951 mark logics technology and software engineering expertise were important to the success of this project
3342952 we needed a solution that would maximize our use of xml and xquery so soldiers da civilians and dod contractors could find what they need and quickly apply it and mark logic delivered marklogic server takes full advantage of xml and the mark logic engineering team is there every step of the way providing us with the experience and direction to make this a successful program thanks to mark logic bcks is one of the first organizations to employ xml based technology to achieve km objectives in such an innovative way our next step is to integrate our knowledge base with that of others and move interoperability into the joint interagency and multinational jim environment
3342953 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3342954 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3342955 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3342956 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3343020 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3343021 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3343022 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3343023 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3343024 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3343025 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3343026 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3343027 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3343028 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3343029 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3343030 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3343031 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3343032 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3343033 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3343034 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3343035 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3343036 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3343037 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3343039 what do you think of the new 80 gb ps3 thats coming out soon
3343040 saddam hussein of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages

3343042 our opposition legislators should realize that they did not employ katopola the president appointed her therefore they have no powers to fire her it is only the president himself who can sack her said ntaba this means that they are unable to understand the separation of powers between the legislature and the executive they should not interfere in the executive neither override the latter
3343043 if an appointing authority forgave her who are opposition legislators to say that she has to be fired no matter what resolutions they make katopola will not go she will still be at parliament no body except the president himself can remove her

3343053 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3343054 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3343055 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3343056 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3343057 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3343058 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3343059 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3343060 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3343061 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3343062 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3343063 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3343064 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3343065 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3343066 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3343067 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3343068 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3343069 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3343070 to immediately and unconditionally withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3343071 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3343072 for decades hes been washingtons biggest celebrity john mccain and as washington embraced him john mccain hugged right back the lobbyists running his low road campaign the money billions in tax breaks for oil and drug companies but almost nothing for families like yours lurching to the right then the left the old washington dance whatever it takes john mccain a washington celebrity playing the same old washington game
3343073 some of them he finds really cute and he keeps them and they stay and stay and stay
3343074 your principles mean more to you than any money or success

3343082 ik heb tegen hem gevochten bij een trainingskamp in in duitsland en ik had het heel lastig tegen hem hij heeft een heel snelle worp en hij is opmerkelijk sterk vooral in zijn handen waar hij judoot heeft hij een kans een medaille te halen buiten de mat heb ik geen contact met hem bij alle trainingskampen zie ik hem stil naar zijn muziek luisteren volgens mij weet hij precies waar hij mee bezig is
3343083 ik was vandaag op mijn best en dacht tot in de verlenging te voelen dat we gelijkwaardig waren maar met een snelle overname wist hij me toch nog te verrassen daaraan zie je dat hij wereldkampioen is geweest van de judokas waar ik vandaag tegen heb gevochten vind ik hem de beste

3343109 i grew up seeing soundsystems at weddings parties and local government funded festivals
3343110 and my experience of dancehall came from soundtapes the recordings of reggae dances with mcs and deejays chatting over dub instrumentals were like golddust at school people traded the saxon soundsystem soundtapes round the playground
3343111 i started by rapping other peoples lyrics from the soundtapes we would take their lyrics and put our own little twist on them i did a few parties and tapes
3343112 between the ages of eight and 10 i was strictly into reggae and the first time i heard rapping was rappers delight that was a massive tune people used to sing it round school but it totally went past me to me it was soul talking a soul tune with people talking it wasnt until four years later and the film beat street that i got into rap and hip hop
3343113 viewing dancehall as separate from hip hop or as its often described a jamaican variant of hip hop is crazy as they all come from the same place in the long term which is african music
3343114 reggae caused the birth of hip hop as kool dj herc alleged inventor was jamaican and brought the soundsystem to the bronx
3343115 kool herc was jamaican he went to america with his sound dressed down his patois and flipped it into hip hop
3343116 unsung dancehall and reggae artists like the ragga twins and what they were doing with the unity soundsystem and papa levi and the saxon soundsystem in the 1980s were completely under the radar from london and the uk we wanted to highlight their influence on the here and now and try to understand english mcs in terms of their englishness and caribbean background
3343117 we made more money in the first six months on the rave scene than in the 15 years doing reggae
3343118 its always been topical smiley cultures cockney translation translated cockney for jamaicans and police officer was about being stopped and searched its the tradition of the african griot and the english town crier its the same thing storytelling a combination of stand up entertainment telling a joke telling a story motivating the crowd and getting a response
3343119 you get beautiful moments with grime mcs some of them dont even know where the culture comes from but its a beautiful thing how theyve taken it on and the influence is reaching from different generations and age groups and to people from different backgrounds not just jamaican kids
3343120 ocha is extremely concerned by the escalation and the violence the situation is deteriorating on the ground amidst a significant movement of population
3343121 thats why ocha is asking all parties to give humanitarian organisations access to people who are wounded to people who need aid
3343122 both sides blame each other for continuing hostilities in south ossetia preventing people from leaving the region

3343124 we thought it best at the time to protect the organizations as well as to get the funds back into the organization to deal with it in house it was a judgment call at the time and looking back people can agree or disagree with it but we did what we thought was right
3343125 clearly this was an uncomfortable conflicting and humiliating situation as far as my family and i were concerned
3343126 and so the real decisions on how to handle it had to be made by others
3343127 overzealous or unscrupulous campaign workers in several michigan counties are under investigation for voter registration fraud suspected of attempting to register nonexistent people or forging applications for already registered voters
3343128 hey im okay that kind of hurt but i mean i fell off a moving motor vehicle the bike looks okay lets see if it runs

3343131 taiwanese lcd panel manufacturers have reduced production by more than 15 but oversupply is likely to continue until mid 2009
3343132 trends in the panel market and the mask market dont really correlate in the panel market and the mask market as panel manufacturers are currently replacing tools in an effort to cut costs sales growth is expected to continue at our mask business for more than one year from now
3343133 they will be launched as planned but volume production in earnest will only start in two years or three years in the worst scenario to lower the cost to a marketable level the technology must be advanced one or two steps forward
3343134 could lead to higher payroll and health costs for companies already being hurt by rising fuel and commodities costs and the tough economic climate
3343135 change wont come from the top change will come from mobilized grass roots thats what ill do ill organize black folks for change
3343136 significant labor law changes will likely start with the elimination of secret ballots for union organizing elections so that unions can verbally
3343137 its time for the justice department to begin negotiations with the teamsters regarding the elimination of the irb independent review board which investigates and punishes corruption
3343138 we respect the choice made by these employees and hope the ibew local 21 also respects that choice
3343139 we look forward to our team of employees in merrillville continuing to provide great service to our customers in northwest indiana
3343140 its part of comcasts national strategy to get rid of unions
3343141 they comcast workers hope to get a raise in pay now that theyre non union with the price of gas they are all facing economic struggles they wanted to stay union but their financial circumstances dictated they had to make a tough decision
3343142 these employees made their choice in a free and fair secret ballot election
3343143 that the number of cards that were signed had less to do with support for the union and more to do with the effectiveness of the organizer speaking to the workers
3343144 the number of cards signed seems to have little relationship to the vote count
3343145 its the best offer in 20 years its a good contract
3343146 its just a bunch of mind games the company is playing theyre trying to scare more people to cross the line
3343147 company negotiators led by lead company negotiator dan dymarkowski lied repeatedly to union negotiators at the table and they are now lying to the public
3343148 what were doing is showing the company that theyre not going to make airplanes
3343149 it is beyond me how one can possibly claim that a system whereby everyone your employer your union organizer and your co workers knows exactly how you vote on the issue of unionization gives an employee free choice
3343150 the employee free choice act would strip american workers of their right to a private ballot vote require companies to submit to binding arbitration and increase penalties for unfair labor practices committed by employers but not by unions each of these provisions would be bad for american workers
3343151 congress should instead protect the privacy of american workers and guarantee their right to vote in an election before joining a union congress should also guarantee every worker the opportunity to hear arguments from both sides and time to reflect before voting
3343152 we rarely showed workers what an actual union contract looked like because we knew that it wouldnt necessarily reflect what a worker would want to see
3343153 the union would provide the employees according to their priorities such as seniority or how much they favored that particular contractor
3343154 there is simply no way that we can balance the budget before the end of the year without laying off city employees
3343155 services to our community and those that need it most
3343156 they have to balance their budgets and theyre doing it on the backs of the citizens
3343157 it is a very sad day in the city of duluth
3343158 city employees are the lifeblood of our organization and this action will be a terrible blow to the organization
3343159 every 100 000 of failed strategies requires laying off an additional seven employees by september 1
3343160 we have been working almost nonstop for seven months trying to find a way to avoid this very situation
3343161 all of the controversial proposals that we have brought forward were our attempt to do everything we could to limit the number of employees that would lose their job unfortunately the vast majority of city costs are personnel costs and it is apparent that we can not balance the budget without layoffs thats a reality that breaks my heart
3343162 they promised me in an aggressive fashion that i would be ok
3343163 working men and women who have courageously stood up for the american dream
3343164 we work hard for all pro and we want the company to succeed
3343165 but this should be our choice we are not being recognized and we are being disrespected by not getting any benefits including something as simple as bathroom breaks and lunch breaks
3343166 it was beautiful i didnt touch a door the entire time
3343167 she did want a permanent job in the construction industry im sure that is something a lot of people would want
3343168 but the nature of the construction industry means jobs come and go local leaders helped her out to the extent that they could but when it came down to it there werent any jobs available that matched her set of skills
3343169 you practically have to give a dna test to get hired at kfc
3343170 i allowed the union to dictate every move i made a change to win and i lost
3343171 i was a celebrity they made me believe i was in it for the long haul it was too good to be true
3343172 everyone really appreciated her help at the committee hearing she was the star of the show there just werent jobs at the time that matched her skill set
3343173 i call it the 15 minutes of fame now i dont have an explanation for friends and family
3343174 to open up some ears i just want to work
3343175 if my daughter looks at me like i looked at my mother
3343176 they should have just left me alone i would still be working at all pro

3343179 were ready to play offense for organized labor its time we had a president who didnt choke saying the word union a president who strengthens our unions by letting them do what they do best organize our workers
3343180 i will make it the law of the land when im president of the united states
3343181 a poorly disguised attempt by the labor unions to swell their ranks at the expense of workers rights and employers
3343182 to take away the protection of a private ballot giving union organizers free rein to publicly pressure workers into signing cards stating support for a union this is un american
3343183 the obvious intention and design of the bill is to eliminate private ballots as the primary means of certifying unions in this country
3343184 as a result it would expose workers to harassment and intimidation by unions and also arguably by employers we have a secret ballot process because we believe this is the best way to make a choice free from coercion this is basically an attempt by the unions to be able to do organizing on the cheap
3343185 this is simply a debate over process but it is up to the workers and they should be free to choose their process
3343186 if they wish to vote by secret ballot instead of a card check process they can the law does not strip them of that right
3343187 will allow workers to form a union through majority sign up and card checks
3343188 would know which workers voted to join a union and which did not
3343189 your task o roman is to rule and bring to men the arts of government to impose upon them the arts of peace to spare those who submit to subdue the arrogant
3343190 revision of this strategy underlines the importance that the government places on obtaining all the information necessary to enable us to tackle the development of antimicrobial resistance effectively and share up to date information with stakeholders

3343196 every expenditure has been in the context of fighting poverty
3343197 she wasnt my mother in law when she got the contract
3343198 its very important for unions not to do this kind of thing
3343199 union leadership is a public trust all the more so when the people being represented are among the lowest paid in america
3343200 i believe the city of charlottetown now should be very proactive and start to work to create an industrial park we should be working with industrial owners that are in the heart of the city and do not have to be there from a transportation and location perspective and a safety and security perspective
3343201 youre trying to create a quality of life that exists in the nice new subdivisions that are being built where the residents would never have to experience or have to live alongside industrial use
3343202 their safety record has been very good i think it depends on the situation but i dont foresee a problem at least i hope not
3343203 weve been in the business now for 50 years and we dont plan on moving unless he comes up with a pile of money

3343212 nachkommen und blutsverwandte werden darin gegen ber dem lebenden ehegatten stark bevorzugt

3343233 i really thought about it and wanted to have a crack at him but i didnt quite have the run up the hill
3343234 i could have tried something risky but the difference between second and third for me was small compared to the negative i would have had if i took out one of these chase guys and got a bad reputation
3343235 i wanted to be respectful of the guys who are doing it week in week out its not my place to stick my nose in and ruin someone elses day thats fighting for the chase
3343236 im really proud of the job theyve done and i hope it can give them the shot in the arm they need to get the momentum to move forward
3343237 theyve had a tough run but i hope i can play my part in helping to get them back on track
3343238 in a lot of regards hes improved for us one thing that we noticed right away and it started even before we went on break a little bit was that he was taking a more active approach in the leadership of our team and its very evident now
3343239 he ran great he broke tackles i think this year we will be able to see for certain what deangelo williams can do
3343240 hes the babe ruth of the pacific coast league hes loose having fun and having great at bats hes the best hitter ive ever seen at triple a
3343241 if they have the opportunity to bring me up theyre going to do it
3343242 im not going to worry about things i dont have control over i wish i could be there but i dont have any control i cant pick when the right time is to bring me up
3343243 he has electric stuff hes young and just needed to sharpen up a couple different parts of his game in the spring but his fastball and curveball and everything were well above the major league average it was outstanding he needed a little bit more seasoning but obviously he made a real good impression with everyone
3343244 he continues to be a spark offensively and defensively he puts a lot of pressure on the other team when hes on base
3343245 it works out well when you can draw back on things you know that no matter how bad your numbers are and how bad youre struggling you know your good swing is not too far off youve just got to get back to basics and think back to whats helped you get out of slumps in the past

3343260 but i doubt she had any contribution to it it was probably the work of really talented writers
3343261 shed probably write a few her self and have the dogs do the rest

3343263 she doesnt seem to be a great pet owner and i know she adopted an illegal animal a while back but she loves that tinkerbell shed probably make tinkerbell secretary of education maybe even in charge of health and human services
3343264 it reminds me of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag
3343265 she would probably keep u s secretary of state condi rice in place because she wears cute pumps but shed leave all the work to her as for attending foreign balls and conferences i can see her having a throw down with chancellor of germany angela merkel or french president nicolas sarkozys wife and former model carla bruni it could be hard not being the hottest girl at the ball

3343267 in a way the result in hungary was a very important lesson for the team it showed us in no uncertain terms that we cannot afford to be complacent and need to work hard throughout the summer break to make sure we can hit back strongly in valencia
3343268 you can never underestimate a team like ferrari and we know theyll be pushing just as hard as us to gain an advantage for the remainder of the year
3343269 who knows if wed had an easier race in hungary maybe it would have come back and bitten us later in the season so i feel confident that we wont be taking anything for granted

3343326 you know we have bitches like kaity at the castle one of the reasons why i came here was because arc agreed that if i brought back a new vampire i would get out of an arranged marriage it was set when i was seven years old that i would have to marry tzipora when she turned we were both eighteen she thinks nothing of humans and she always hated me now she just hates me more for leaving her
3343327 yes arc knowa he can sense a vampiress has been born if you dont come to him he will track you down
3343328 but tomorrow how will we get there where will we go once we do

3343534 it professionals are dealing with an increasing focus on boosting storage system efficiency especially in terms of maximizing capacity utilization and system availability two key enablers of such efficiency are virtualization and more flexible storage systems
3343535 although many storage systems can actually be impediments to broad successful virtualization deployment lefthand networks clustered architecture provides key advantages for such deployments and stands as a leading example of what can be done by optimizing storage system performance and utilization in combination with simplified management in order to provide efficient cost effective high availability and disaster recovery

3343579 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3343580 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3343581 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3343582 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3343583 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3343584 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3343585 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3343586 the enthusiasm dedication and sheer determination of everyone who has contributed by performing buying a ticket and rising to their feet to cheer on the jubilee is the reason for our ongoing success
3343587 its because of this magical combination that we have become the largest production of its kind in north america
3343588 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3343589 wenn bei mir in der fraktion geld wegkommen w rde und ich h tte vorher gesagt geht mit den finanzen um wie ihr wollt dann k nnte mich niemand mehr retten und ich m sste zur cktreten

3343592 when i got to the house to make the special delivery i heard sounds from inside asking for help
3343593 i went into the kitchen and saw norman his legs covered in blood his wife hazel was trying to wake him up calling him back
3343594 i didnt know what to do since i know nothing about first aid
3343595 i just stood up and there was blood all over the floor and i couldnt stop it
3343596 my shoes were full my socks were full and it was terrible
3343597 i was frightened i was getting weaker and weaker my tongue had pins and needles in it and i thought this is it
3343598 i waited for about 15 20 minutes until the ambulance came
3343599 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3343600 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3343601 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3343602 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3343603 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3343608 nel mondo di google la privacy individuale non esiste pi
3343609 e la dimostrazione pi eclatante nella spaventosa mole di informazioni dettagliate che la stessa google ora colleziona su ognuno di noi informazioni che qualsiasi utente di internet pu raccogliere in un dossier vero e proprio in meno di 30 minuti
3343610 semplicemente spaventoso il fatto che ogni americano soggetto a questo tipo di violazione attraverso il click di un mouse
3343611 you dunk when you have to dunk they have 7 footers if you dont take it hard yao would block it he did block one i dont know your definition of showing off to me thats hard basketball i thought we played very hard i thought we took it to the basket hard dont confuse hard with showing off
3343612 i come here to see the ultra wasp y crowd in new york
3343613 if i were single i would come here to find girls to hook up with
3343614 as a girl i would not come here to hook up with a guy for just that reason
3343615 i came to see the place where the preppy killer was
3343616 but there are none here so well come back tomorrow
3343617 i feel like they disappear as soon as they happen when i wake up i think i had fun the night before and then i reconfirm it with other people
3343618 i came down and stopped at elaines and there was nothing happening
3343619 ive been to a lot of places and theres no place like dorrians
3343620 the best thing about dorrians is that theyve got a pretty good class of people if they can help you they cant theyll say not they wont just walk away
3343621 the bouncers dont disrespect you like some places that want to call you all sorts of
3343622 excuse my language im going to say buttheads its a great place one of the best
3343623 most of them are white and young i notice how preppy they are but these are good kids its one thing to be preppy and be a shithead excuse my language but these guys are good kids
3343624 a imagem nas c meras precisava ser impec vel expressiva e em linha com o sentimento nacional
3343625 lin miaoke tinha as caracter sticas certas mas a voz era de yang peiyi
3343626 it was all done as part of a days work much like the way early comic books were made they certainly werent made as art they werent sold as art and they werent thought of as art
3343627 wacky packages just formed an island of subversive underground culture in the surrounding sea of junk
3343628 i didnt know they were that memorable until about 12 years ago with the internet
3343629 before that i didnt think of it as any more important than the other series
3343630 art used to say i like to think of it as drawing twenty dollar bills
3343631 it wasnt like every day a thousand people would mock tide
3343632 anything that happens when youre eight years old can mark you for life just ask sigmund freud
3343633 wackies were a young childs first exposure to subverting adult consumer culture
3343634 thirty five years later that generation has matured into adults who can afford to nostalgically consume a deluxe volume brimming with that subversion yessirree i am proud to have been a worker in the debased basement of the great temple of commerce that is americas popular culture
3343635 the page you selected contains an item that does not exist it may have been deleted by another user
3343636 the iaaf is sending a clear message that we will not tolerate doping
3343637 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
3343638 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
3343639 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
3343640 with social networking marketers are getting the kids to create the ads and share them with their friends
3343641 it is incredibly sticky and it is viral regulators need to understand that
3343642 the report finds that although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
3343643 the cost of reaching and engaging a lot more kids is a lot less than the cost of what it is to buy a 30 second television ad
3343644 they are using a powerful arsenal of tools to target children and adolescents so they can engage in these unhealthy eating behaviors
3343645 to show that the government needs to regulate this advertising to improve childrens diets would be pretty tough
3343646 we think that companies can act on a self regulatory basis much more quickly than the government can
3343647 listen up fellow parents when we point a collective finger three more are pointing right back at us
3343648 when will we stop playing the victim and start taking personal responsibility for our kids health and eating habits
3343649 being able to bend light in unusual ways is important for applications that almost resemble magic
3343650 there still is a long way to go but the berkeley team made an important step
3343651 when i sent my first tape to the head of gramophone programmes at the bbc i had made the fatal mistake of forgetting to rewind it to the start
3343652 yet that gentleman took the time to wind it all the way back and once hed listened to it things went from there
3343653 i can tell you if i was a young chap coming over from ireland today they probably wouldnt even listen to my tape let alone rewind it
3343654 somehow that old fashioned thoroughness and commitment have disappeared i suppose no one has the time for it any more
3343655 when i started people who worked for the bbc knew they werent earning as much as people in commercial television but they did have the satisfaction of knowing that they worked for one of the finest if not the finest broadcasting organisation in the whole world
3343656 im not sure they feel that any more or at least that it means as much as it used to
3343657 i was considering giving up before belgrade and now i have to say im very doubtful about ever wanting to do eurovision again
3343658 ive had so much fun but i think its time for someone else to take over
3343659 were using a bionic ear to make a bionic eye

3343663 the notes show tojo kept his died in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3343664 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent
3343665 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3343666 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3343667 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3343668 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved
3343669 now that the diplomatic steps have been taken after the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it though i have a separate view
3343670 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be sacrifice for a great cause
3343671 the anatomy of a subway hack breaking crypto rfids amp magstripes of ticketing systems
3343672 providing program information software code or commands that would assist another in circumventing the security of the mbtas fare system
3343673 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community
3343674 and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
3343675 make big gains in both house and senate this autumn
3343676 mccain is not so bad a figure to deal with a democratic congress from the perspective of many independent voters seen in that light the voters reluctance to swing behind obama in landslide numbers is understandable
3343677 its easily forgotten but obamas candidacy would never have gained the slightest traction were it not for his opposition to the iraq war from the start its what distinguished him from hillary clinton and gave voice to those who simply wanted to cut american losses and move on
3343678 the catastrophe endures of course the political progress in baghdad remains fitful and the financial costs grow all the time however the sharp decline in american deaths has rescued the neo imperial project from universal obloquy and any news that takes the edge off iraq as a total fiasco helps the republican
3343679 obamas candidacy would never have gained the slightest traction were it not for his opposition to the war from the start
3343680 if he were merely to maintain his lead he would snag 322 electoral votes to mccains 216
3343681 there will be some swings ahead if the past is any guide but so far the basic dynamic hasnt really changed and its mccain who has to change it and soon
3343682 we have other areas in the neighborhood of hawthorne that are still struggling but talking to the neighbors in those areas its getting better people are purchasing some properties their rehabbing them i think were on the way up but its going to be a slow difficult climb
3343683 ich habe mein bild quasi aus dem rahmen genommen und direkt auf den fu boden gemalt so ist innerhalb des stadions ein st ck raumkunst entstanden
3343684 die neue kunst vermittelt den b rgern ein lebensgef hl das viel dynamischer ist als es fr her der fall war das sich weniger an berkommenen normen orientiert und die dinge von unterschiedlichen blickwinkeln aus betrachtet neue inhalte ber die diskutiert und nachgedacht werden muss verleihen der ffentlichen diskussion eine zus tzliche spannung und indem die menschen diese freie kunst betrachten beginnen sie zu verstehen wie wichtig individualismus und kreatives schaffen sind

3343700 i would just appeal to you and to our legislators to look for other sources that wont cause people to be losers all across the state
3343701 volumes have continued to climb on the jse while they have stagnated in certain world markets an element of this is attributable to the fact that the equities market of the jse has a large commodity component
3343702 our counterparty risk is probably one of the main strengths we can put in front of our clients
3343703 by using seals we have increased the number of hydrographic profiles 30 fold
3343704 what we know about the southern ocean is very limited which makes predicting the formation of sea ice difficult
3343705 these animals are filling a blind spot in our sampling
3343706 occasionally they stay long enough for the data loggers atop their heads to send the data via satellite
3343707 on average we can collect two profiles a day from each seal
3343708 in the antarctic when seawater freezes to form sea ice the salt usually suspended in the water is ejected into the water beneath the ice
3343709 we wanted to understand the foraging ecology of elephant seals and study their role in the marine food web
3343710 we think the seals at the bottom try to catch deep dwelling animals like squid and fish at these depths the seals lungs and body can be compressed to overcome the great pressures at 2 000m

3343714 our old paper based process took a cookie cutter approach to hr but you really cant take a group approach to highly specific talent and performance management issues
3343715 having used successfactors at a previous company i knew that the solution offered an easy way to customize each process and goal for the person or issue youre dealing with its a one stop shop i know where things are now and as a result the reviews are that much more eye opening and effective

3343724 i am moved and grateful that the president wrote to me there are so many people like me yet she has shown such concern towards me i do hope i can walk into rashtrapati bhavan and meet her
3343725 for the past 15 years my world was full of pain and helplessness with this crippling disease all i could do was sit or lie down on my bed and take a few faltering painful steps to go to the toilet it was a very depressing state of affairs for my family and me and many times i would wonder what is the point of existing like this
3343726 i also look forward to the day when this brave girl seema is able to walk normally and go about with ease she is a highly intelligent sensitive and caring person and deserves the best in life
3343727 when seema first came to fortis she was bedridden and wheel chair bound and severely depressed the 37 year old lady weighed only 40 kg her case was complex as she had multiple joint involvement her bones were severely fragile and osteoporotic her joints had lost mobility and were fixed and her muscles were atomic and weak because she had been immobile for many years it was a very challenging and rare case indeed

3343729 i have not received any direction from the central upa leaders to resign there is no question of my resigning my government is safe
3343730 the upa high command is of the opinion that support to the koda government should be withdrawn if he fails to resign the congress has also asked him to resign the decision to make me chief minister by replacing koda was taken long back even lalu prasad had supported my chief ministership i dont know what he says now

3343857 the 100 back has progressed faster than any other female event
3343858 for me to win gold im so proud thats why i was crying like a little baby on the stand i was overwhelmed with emotion
3343859 i mentally prepared myself i believed someone would break my record at the olympic games i had to keep my mind and head together
3343860 that was the most amazing swim ive ever seen it got a lot of us really pumped up
3343861 when i first saw the time i thought they had made a mistake
3343862 that did add a lot of pressure and made me nervous
3343863 it was the best time for me the gold medal it will all hit me when i try to go to bed tonight
3343864 we focus on this meet the most we think for every four years
3343865 the fact is that income inequality is real its been rising for more than 25 years
3343866 his humility is noteworthy he doesnt have any air of stardom and hes so much like any other ordinary guy that its an absolute treat to be his costar
3343867 hes a champion at it im a buddhu and even though i was sloshed srk took it upon himself to teach me this game
3343868 in the beginning i was an embarrassment a total disaster but by the third round i could do it right
3343869 i was an nsd student and he was with barry john somehow even though it was dark in the auditorium his face stayed on in my mind
3343870 akshay leads a very disciplined lifestyle and therefore his energy level never drops he gets up at six every morning when i am shooting with him i have to work a lot harder to match up with him
3343871 i dont want to start anything man but its pretty frustrating when we dont score runs molina said
3343872 this is a team sport and im not blaming anybody or pointing fingers i want to make that clear but as a group were not scoring runs and we lose thats it
3343873 bochy can move the lineup all around whatever he needs to do but its
3343874 but thats part of this game for young kids dealing with tough times
3343875 some people take a little longer maturity wise hes driving the same pitches that he fouled off last year he looked like he waited a long time just to see if the pitch was a strike now hes confident enough to know he can expand the zone attack pitches and drive them out of the ballpark
3343876 i couldnt have imagined it rosario villa recently said in an interview conducted in spanish
3343877 she never said there wasnt enough time or money brenda said of rosario
3343878 youre a boy but im better than you villa said in reference to the confidence boost it gave her
3343879 it gave us motivation as cheesy as it sounds if you put in the work you can match up with anybody villa said
3343880 she makes it sound like it was all so easy
3343881 she doesnt have long arms like other great water polo players tanner said
3343882 i was surprised at how much better she made other people tanner said
3343883 when you look at the careers of catchers they usually get 200 to 300 games in the minor leagues stanley said
3343884 hes in the 150 game range but hes playing so well that once theres a need hell be here
3343885 he could take john bowkers glove right now pick up a ball and throw to third base with amazing strength
3343886 he can throw a left handed curveball too and i mean its a good one
3343887 best stuff i ever caught said bochy who also received nolan ryan
3343888 he had to be one of the top two most intimidating pitchers i ever saw
3343889 its been a roller coaster ride said fremonts kevin tan who had a less than satisfactory performance on his two events tuesday
3343890 we just rolled with it we just rolled through the meet

3343898 the last campaigne robert f kennedy and the 82 days that inspired america
3343899 they blackburn seem interested as they came all the way here to see me
3343900 people pigeon hole you and youve got to accept that
3343901 i do expect my team to be organised and committed but weve got fuller and lawrence and people like that who are good players
3343902 and last season we scored more goals than anybody else apart from west brom and lost the least games so we didnt have a bad season
3343903 everybodys entitled to their opinion but what weve got to do is sure we stay focused on what were trying to achieve if we can get better quality of players then the team evolves to a different level
3343904 but you cant go and outplay manchester united liverpool arsenal or chelsea
3343905 the team will work the same way that its always worked
3343906 i dont think well play any differently than we did in getting to the league were very tight behind the ball but when we get the ball weve got to use it well
3343907 weve got to battle harder than ever before and then when we get the chance play some football but the belief is there that we can do well this season
3343908 we have a physical style but bolton have used that to their advantage in the past and hopefully we can
3343909 lets also not forget theres a lot of quality on the ball and we can play when we want to
3343910 we can go long or short and hopefully well be alright with that i think you need to be physical and assert yourself on games because if you get brushed aside you get passed to death and teams will just roll over you hopefully well stand up against them
3343911 set pieces are going to be crucial too rorys throw is like a corner for a start we need every bit of weaponry we can find and hopefully the set pieces will help us
3343912 we werent one of the fashionable clubs to get promoted last year but we managed to achieve it and im hoping for exactly the same this season
3343913 theres a massive gulf between the championship and the premier league and theres a massive gulf between what weve got and what others have got rightly so were going to be the underdogs
3343914 every year the three teams that go up are the favourites to come back down but theres teams that have gone up and done well like wigan and so were looking at that target
3343915 if we get off to a good start and make the britannia a fortress then i think well do fine weve got a great squad the manager has bought in good players and everybody is excited we certainly wont be overawed
3343916 well be going out there as a team and as a unit and thats the most important thing because if we go out there as individuals then well get rolled over
3343917 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3343918 this is a planning took where all things are going
3343919 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3343920 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3343921 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3343922 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3343923 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3343924 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3343925 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

3344128 s que se le llama superstici n y que no debo pensar en esas cosas pero voy a esperar a ver c mo esta el campo y cuales son mis sensaciones de cara a este torneo si no me encuentro seguro y tengo alguna duda no voy a forzar y voy a hablar con el mister y si veo que no he de estar tranquilo prefiero quedarme en el banquillo
3344129 estoy trabajando bastante bien y eso para m es muy importante como he dicho ya tengo 34 a os y para m el trabajo de pretemporada es muy importante estoy en un buen momento y estoy contento porque el entrenador sigue d ndome mucha confianza estoy haciendo una buena pretemporada y teniendo muchos minutos para poder estar en las mejores condiciones para el inicio de campa a
3344130 siempre me siento como un titular y siempre trabajo para serlo

3344137 were tracking a similar drought pattern as we saw in 2003 and we urge everyone to be extremely cautious
3344138 we are getting into a warmer pattern following the heavy rain we got over the weekend the weather is going to stay on the hotter warmer side for the next couple of weeks which is about as far ahead as we can reasonably predict
3344139 when you look back at the weather from 2003 as a whole starting from january it looks very similar to what the whole weather for 2008 looks like however when you just look at the summer weather then you see differences in summer of 2003 between june and august the kelowna area received 23 6 millimeters of rain since june of this year kelowna has received 51 millimeters almost double the amount
3344140 i saw this flash on the water and before i could do anything i saw the hull of the other boat followed by this horrendous noise before i knew it i was under water with my boat upside down and on top of me
3344141 i basically said my goodbyes because i thought i was dead when i opened my eyes i could see my boat lights and swam to them and found an air pocket then i dove down and got through the obstructions boat tower and popped up i hung on to my boat and was 400 yards from shore so i started yelling for help and the other boat came back
3344142 one of the fellows in the other boat said he ducked and felt my boat go right over his head were all very lucky to be alive
3344143 judging by what the other driver told me he was running at a fairly high rate of speed and as far as im concerned there were no working lights on that boat
3344144 it doesnt matter how safe you think you are when its that dark at night and other boaters dont have running lights and going at an excess speed its impossible to see them until they are driving over you its really not a good idea to be boating at night on this lake even though you might be doing everything right theres always that other person you have to worry about
3344145 rcmp attempted to arrest a 22 year old kelowna woman for causing a disturbance by fighting this woman who appeared to be very intoxicated was previously asked to leave the area after she was observed impeding traffic on leon avenue by sitting on the roadway
3344146 during the arrest the woman continued to fight with the arresting officer even after being handcuffed while she was escorted to the awaiting transporting police vehicle she kicked the escorting police officer
3344147 this vehicle was stopped at the corner of mill street and water street officers advised the individual that he was under arrest for dangerous driving however he refused to cooperate when asked to exit the vehicle
3344148 at one point pepper spray was used in an attempt to subdue the subject however this did not appear to have any affect on him
3344149 there are half a dozen different locations where the pot growers are dumping equipment and soil and its not just regular potting soil its laced with chemicals and pesticides they dumpers have to use rubber gloves to handle it and then they leave the gloves behind
3344150 not only does this stuff look bad it is not a healthy thing for the wild animals in the area they can get injured by this stuff
3344151 in the fall or early spring during the deer hunting season people are leaving carcasses ive also seen cows dropped off just left to rot or when people have pets die they just drop them off
3344152 if they get into the stream system there are some people in this area who actually take their water supply from the creek they could get really sick even die
3344153 ive seen everything tossed in the woods from kitchen sinks to old refrigerators and sofas its very frustrating
3344154 tree branches are not litter animal parts and carcasses are not litter litter is things like plastic bags and garbage
3344155 the litter act was designed for people throwing things out car windows more than anything if someone drives down the road and tosses a mcdonalds burger wrapper out the window that falls under the litter act i dont think when they made this legislation that it would would deal with people dumping garbage in the woods
3344156 we have to have something to investigate just saying there is someone dumping garbage wont help us depending on whats on our plate on a particular day it may not be a high enough priority to investigate
3344157 we will charge an individual and have in the past if there is sufficient evidence such as a license plate then we have the individual clean it up take it to the dump and bring a receipt to show that they dropped it off after which instead of taking court action we go by the way of writing a ticket the maximum ticket fine is 100
3344158 the cost of cleaning up illegal dump sites on public land is about 17 000 each year
3344159 thats down substantially from where it was about 10 years ago when we had a full time crew working five days a week cleaning up sites now we have a contractor who is responsible for this and basically works one day a week
3344160 this will be an excellent addition to the services we offer our small business community
3344161 bizpal will allow our entrepreneurs a more streamlined and simplified start up process
3344162 the government of canada is pleased to be working with the province of british columbia and the district of peachland to promote a more competitive and productive local economy by providing easy access to essential information and reducing paperwork costs for business
3344163 the awards committee considered this plan an excellent way to celebrate cultural history and a playful form of way finding while helping residents and visitors to experience the area to its fullest
3344164 we are very excited to partner with nona this year for our third annual moonlight serenade gala their work is making such a difference in the lives of families throughout the okanagan and we want to contribute to their efforts
3344165 this event has been such a success for the past two years and we have no doubt the community will work with us again to support this cause with the same high level of enthusiasm
3344166 everything is premised around waterfront in the okanagan private moorage is a rarity moorage is at a high premium in the area and can be extremely prohibitive having a private place for your boat is a unique privilege that the sheerwater lifestyle affords
3344167 his style of dealing with employees is probably something people in my position arent crazy about
3344168 but if you look at his history he tends to grow companies he is involved with we are hopeful in that regard
3344169 is a real sign of confidence in the brand in our strategic direction
3344170 one thing thats the same is that we are executing against a strategic plan that has been in place for a number of years
3344171 but this is not likely to offset the losses in the first half of the year
3344172 good earth has cafes open throughout alberta with a strategic road map to expand across all of western canada
3344173 we are extremely excited by the opening of our first bc location in kelowna on pandosy south the new cafe will allow us to serve our great coffee and great food to new customers as well as to visiting albertans in the area we have strong awareness in alberta and our cafes are easy to operate
3344174 i think the kelowna area is the perfect place to open a good earth cafe
3344175 more and more people are familiar with the company both local and visiting albertans and i know they will love the good earth concept and service we provide
3344176 the secret of making 300 or more per day just doing simple data entry jobs from the comfort of your own home
3344177 my wife is from the local area and i am from abbotsford and i was working for sun rype as a buyer working in the co packing group nobody was packaging the way we can with our new machine where we can shrink wrap a product and it doesnt matter how small or large the order it can be done in our operation nothing has been done like this for the commercial trade we went out to find a machine that could do this job just about all over north america when i was at sun rype and we wanted a special packaging we would have to move the product to vancouver for packaging and i wondered at the time if this could work here if we had the right equipment i did a lot of research on the idea and wondered if it could work here i decided it could and bought the right machine we had a selling job to do so that companies could see what increases they could achieve with the right packaging for todays marketplace we can produce a package with the company logo for anyone and six pack or twelve pack a product for the store shelves
3344178 we found out there was nobody between vancouver and toronto now there are people doing this type of packaging but they are only doing it for themselves and most equipment is built specifically for one product we on the other hand can do from jams and jellies to larger bottles and everything in between
3344179 youre exactly right there are probably 200 businesses that could use the service in the okanagan that are not fully aware of us yet we already have customers that want to get into a market and this will be the way through our packaging it will allow them to do so

3344182 no jacob you cant have ice cream for breakfast or no ethan stop attacking your brother
3344183 when you are in a hole stop digging this simple familiar advice might appear very apt for the
3344184 so what types of digging needs to stop first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution
3344185 there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3344186 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives
3344187 one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3344188 instead the public grow cynical as government rhetoric becomes increasingly divorced from reality while practitioners grow exasperated to implement yet another initiative often before the previous one has even been evaluated

3344208 weve got two players that very much want to move into bankable feasibility studies immediately and weve been encouraged by that
3344209 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3344210 what we now suspect is that it was a set up to get mr pratt to sign an agreed statement
3344211 mr pratt was targeted for criminal investigation led into the belief that there wasnt going to be any
3344212 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3344213 these proceedings concern a relatively narrow matter and that is in our submission the truth or otherwise of the evidence mr pratt gave
3344214 to say we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation
3344215 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3344216 together telstra and the catholic church can become a community life portal on a much bigger scale

3344238 en el descanso reflexionamos sobre eso se habl de que china pod a ganar y la actitud del equipo cambi china jug un partido extraordinario

3344242 how would you feel if you checked your mail one day and in it there was a check for 233
3344243 this was voted upon and approved by your city council which includes a mayor who is on his way out and two councilmen who will hopefully be un elected in may the city councilman who was the one time general counsel for ma maricopa wisely kept his distance and didnt vote he didnt need to
3344244 why is the council in such a hurry to approve this thing
3344245 i ask again why is the council in such a hurry to approve this thing i wonder who has a stake in this company i know that developer steven northroup does i wonder if anyone else involved in this deal does
3344246 another question how can the city council give away a zoning change when a published notification is required by state law and city code in order to hold public hearings first with the planning and zoning commission and the city council
3344247 two hundred and thirty three dollars and thirty four cents thats your stake in this how did i come up with this figure i divided 30 000 which is the estimated population of maricopa by 3 5 to arrive at the number of families i then divided 2 000 000 by the result
3344248 this isnt a done deal yet the check hasnt been written there is still time for citizen input at the council meeting where theyll have to vote on this thing that wont be a hastily called meeting it will be a regularly scheduled meeting and this will have to be on the agenda get involved send an e mail show up let them know how you feel

3344257 runecrafting teleport tablets are identical to the teleport tablets you can build in your player owned house and can be used to teleport you to any altar you have the requirements to craft runes at
3344258 the omni talisman is a remarkable object created by elriss to enable the devoted runecrafter to access almost every altar freely if you are able to show her a talisman for each of the runecrafting altars that require them so theres no need to find a talisman for the ourania altar for instance she will grant you a hefty chunk of runecrafting experience for each as well as the omni talisman to craft an omni talisman into a tiara or staff take it to wizard korvak who can be found staggering about in the runecrafting guild jumping at shadows and being generally terrified of everything
3344259 in addition to helping you convert the omni talisman into tiaras and staves korvak will also replace a lost medium abyssal pouch and repair any other pouches you have of course his experiences have cost him his sanity so expect to have to pay for his services

3344322 load and performance testing is the killer application for cloud computing
3344323 companies can very easily create a real world test environment without having to invest in it developers have virtually unlimited and affordable access to thousands of servers memory storage etc and can essentially on demand simulate load and performance tests for tens of thousands of users without having to purchase the hardware
3344324 were very excited to introduce our etoys babyuniverse and my twinn brands to a half billion new consumers around the world powered by the fiftyone solution from e4x

3344326 the fiftyone solution will act like a lens over our existing u s websites that will automatically generate customized views for international shoppers they will experience the same high quality online shopping experience that we offer our u s customers but tailored to their location
3344327 enabling a u s retailers ecommerce operation for overseas sales is a major step in introducing the retailers brand internationally and to a previously untapped revenue opportunity
3344328 ecommerce outside the u s is growing at more than 50 percent and the historically low u s dollar is driving even more overseas consumers to shop u s retailer sites as the 2008 holiday shopping season approaches
3344329 meanwhile u s retailers are seeing decreasing demand and increased competition for a domestic online market thats continuing to mature
3344330 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3344331 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3344332 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3344333 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3344334 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3344335 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3344336 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3344337 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3344338 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3344339 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3344340 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3344341 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3344342 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3344343 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3344344 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3344350 we take our job seriously because we know its about more than simply scanning a photo it allows people to relive good times share memories with friends and help illustrate family histories without having to dig through the attic for shoeboxes or albums that are falling apart

3344360 loopt is a fun and powerful way for music fans to connect with their favorite artists
3344361 the exchange of information between fans and artists on loopt is both entertaining and actionable the artists not only share stories and photos from the road but also ask fans for recommendations on things to do as they pull into a new city
3344362 we strive to create genuine relationships between artists fans and brands and loopt is an innovative new solution for us
3344363 loopt is the perfect communication tool for touring artists and it gives fans the opportunity to get a behind the ropes peek at their favorite artists daily lives
3344364 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets
3344365 the high rates of negative equity are having a direct effect on home sales figures as weve seen considerable growth in foreclosure transactions and homes selling for a loss unfortunately while there are a few bright spots like pittsburgh oklahoma city and austin that reached record high values most markets are likely to remain in negative territory for the next few quarters given the magnitude of current year over year declines
3344366 porque fue inducido por la circunstancia y no lo sent as realmente
3344367 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3344368 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3344369 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3344370 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3344371 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3344372 we were looking for a technology partner that would complement our efforts in providing hispanics with the best mobile internet experience from any cellular phone
3344373 with netbiscuits mobile web platform not only were we able to accomplish this but we did so with quick turnarounds and at the highest levels of quality which our carrier partners have come to expect from us
3344374 the internet has made it possible for people living outside of their home countries to stay connected with their culture heritage and language with the simple click of the mouse the mobile web should not be treated differently
3344375 working with latcel to bring relevant content to spanish speaking mobile users in the u s is a true testament that it is possible to bring real internet experiences in any language to mobile devices across the world if you have the right technology in hand

3344379 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for
3344380 its tougher to lose a good guy you know than the 40 home run guy
3344381 its going to be tough to replace his offense but its even tougher to replace the man
3344382 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3344383 weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3344384 its nice to be known for something good like that
3344385 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3344386 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3344387 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend and ben curtis a little more stoic a little more subdued but i like his personality hes that type of guy thats going to put his head down and barrel on
3344388 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning
3344389 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3344390 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course theres three weeks to go i like both of them a lot

3344406 and have been fully cooperating with them in their inquiry since we have nothing to hide
3344407 our proposal has been cleared and the pre requisite sum has been sanctioned by the state government for acquiring the biometric devices which will be soon in place at traffic pickets in the city
3344408 the state government has approved our proposals for increasing traffic posts given that the city is expanding fast and so is the population
3344409 we will be recruiting personnel from police department from constabulary positions their traffic management skills will be honed before being posted

3344414 the small business owner smb wins by being able to market themselves across the internet with their webcard listing our partners win with great content and a revenue share and smalltown wins by being the hub of distribution

3344418 is anyone among you ill let him send for the rulers of the church and let them say prayers over him putting oil on him in the name of the lord 15 and by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well and he will be lifted up by the lord and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness
3344419 it had been in the back of my mind and i had often wondered what it would be like to work over there the us but i knew how hard it was to crack it
3344420 but when i had that american credit i thought i would give it a go so i went over for the premiere of house of wax and got an american agent from that
3344421 i did four trips without getting any work at all but its such a slow process because you are starting from scratch
3344422 i was not intending to go over at all this year because the writers strike happened early in the year and i didnt think anything would be happening i thought that was a good excuse to stay in australia
3344423 but my manager called and said i needed to get over there and i only had a seven week window i didnt figure i would get any work in seven weeks
3344424 when i read the script for cold case i was immediately excited about it by the idea of it because it was a good guest role
3344425 it was a meaty strong character so i was excited and i wanted to put a lot of work into it
3344426 they knew my character did it from the start and they are trying to crack him to give up the information to see if there are any lives to be saved
3344427 the character is a conniving creepy guy and a lot of the episode is him playing mind games with kathryn morriss character so most of my scenes were with kathryn and danny pino
3344428 a lot of the episode takes place in a car when they are driving him from one state to another and they are trying to break me and i am trying to break them
3344429 you get a real sense of what it is like for someone who is the lead in a series
3344430 kathryn morris has been doing cold case for five years she has been coming in and playing that character every day but she has to inject that with some new energy each episode and thats something to be admired
3344431 coming in and doing the guest role the excitement and energy is automatically there but someone like her has to do it every episode for five years and i cant get my head around how you keep up the motivation to do that

3344436 biometrics are automated methods of recognizing a person based on a physiological or behavioral characteristic
3344437 it is unique to the individual not something that somebody else decides will be your password shared secret or token says ant allan research director at the gartner group
3344438 passwords can be learned by various means and tokens can be stolen but biometrics cannot
3344439 each of the employees just touches the finger reader pad at each station and theyre in
3344440 most of the activity has occurred at government agencies and defense firms
3344441 in the private sector were seeing some usage in pharmaceuticals financial services and to some level health care
3344442 theyve invested heavily in research and development and theyre willing to invest in security to protect that investment
3344443 to say it can automatically spot a criminal in a crowd is over hyping its capability
3344444 the ssa processed 250 million w 2 forms last year and 100 million of those were filed electronically
3344445 were hoping that this speeds the process and makes it easier for people to work with us
3344446 it started as a single sign on initiative and its definitely raised the security to access applications
3344447 they believe its faster for them to use user names and passwords than the fingerprint scanner but its not thats just their perception
3344448 we have a real dry hand problem here because doctors and nurses are scrubbing and disinfecting their hands constantly throughout the day
3344449 its a fact that hackers have plenty of tools to easily crack passwords
3344450 thats especially important because the association handles peoples retirement money and security is a top priority
3344451 my company very much believes that biometric technology can virtually eliminate id fraud and assure you that someone representing himself as a certain person is who he says he is
3344452 a biometric scan cant confirm the identity of a person it is initially registering into a system but it can prevent multipleregistrations of the same person under different names
3344453 something inside cries out enough enough ive had enough and then they are ready to take that first and often most difficult step toward dealing with their disease

3344473 obviously there is a scheme behind the scenes to encircle china a new cold war
3344474 we will stand up and hold together always as one family in harmony
3344475 to make the thoroughly biased french media and public feel losses and pain
3344476 domestic and foreign hostile forces have made the beijing olympics a focus for infiltration and sabotage
3344477 people who fart through the mouth will get shit stuffed down their throats by me
3344478 someone give me a gun dont show mercy to the enemy
3344479 like a mothball which goes from solid to gas directly
3344480 there will be no more room for nationalism than there is for smallpox
3344481 it appears i have expressed a common feeling a shared view
3344482 china was backward throughout its modern history so we were always seeking the reasons for why the west grew strong
3344483 we learned from the west all of us who are educated have this dream grow strong by learning from the west
3344484 weve been studying western history for so long we understand it well
3344485 we think our love for china our support for the government and the benefits of this country is not a spontaneous reaction it has developed after giving the matter much thought
3344486 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed
3344487 we are always eager to get other information from different channels
3344488 but when you are in a so called free system you never think about whether you are brainwashed
3344489 the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last fifty years
3344490 i can tell you everything about all those movies like star wars
3344491 he wasnt like other kids who spent their pocket money on food he saved all his money to buy books
3344492 if he had questions that he couldnt figure out then he couldnt sleep
3344493 for us if we didnt get it we just gave up
3344494 it was famous we were proud of this at last we had a highway
3344495 problems with human rights property right disputes the threat posed to taiwan
3344496 but we chinese can use it to tell the people of the world that china cannot be insulted
3344497 up to now the chinese government has been able to keep a grip on it
3344498 but i call it the virtual tiananmen square they dont need to go there they can do the same thing online and sometimes be even more damaging
3344499 chinese tradition has many good things but weve ditched them
3344500 i feel there have to be people to carry them on
3344501 most of my generation has a smooth happy life including me
3344502 i feel like our character lacks something for example love for the country or the perseverance you get from conquering hardships those virtues i dont see them in myself and many people my age
3344503 for him from that kind of background with nobody educated in his family nobody helping him with schoolwork with great family pressure its not easy to get where he is today
3344504 leo strauss and the world of intelligence by which we do not mean nous
3344505 during the nineteen eighties and nineties most intellectuals had a negative opinion of chinas traditional culture
3344506 to assess a countrys true strength and prosperity you cant simply look at gnp growth and not look at the inner experience of each ordinary person does he feel safe is he happy
3344507 i sensed that this kid is very smart and diligent
3344508 now we started reading ancient chinese books and we rediscovered the ancient china
3344509 we opened our market but when we try to buy your companies we hit political obstacles its not fair
3344510 no matter who is elected china is still china and will go the way it goes
3344511 who can stand in the way of the march of history
3344512 we used to think they were just a postmodern occidentalized generation
3344513 of course i thought the students i knew were very good but the wider generation i was not very pleased to see the content of tang jies video and the scale of its popularity among the youth made me very happy very happy
3344514 how can our national self respect be so fragile and shallow
3344515 somebody says youre a mob so you curse him even want to beat him and then you say were not a mob this is as if someone said you were a fool so you held up a big sign in front of his girlfriends brothers dog saying i am not a fool the message will get to him but hell still think youre a fool
3344516 however the current young generation turns a blind eye to it ive never seen them respond to those major domestic issues rather they take a utilitarian opportunistic approach
3344517 we accept all the values of human rights of democracy
3344518 we accept that the issue is how to realize it
3344519 june 4th could not and should not succeed at that time if june 4th had succeeded china would be worse and worse not better
3344520 in the nineteen nineties i thought that the chinese government is not good enough maybe we need to set up a better government
3344521 the problem is that we didnt know what a good government would be so we let the chinese communist party stay in place the other problem is we didnt have the power to get them out they have the army
3344522 we really acknowledge him we really think he was brave
3344523 they fought for china to make the country better and there were some faults of the government but finally we must admit that the chinese government had to use any way it could to put down that event
3344524 you eat bread you drink coffee all of these are not brought by democracy indian guys have democracy and some african countries have democracy but they cant feed their own people
3344525 chinese people have begun to think one part is the good life another part is democracy
3344526 if democracy can really give you the good life thats good but without democracy if we can still have the good life why should we choose democracy
3344527 at duke university grace wang a chinese freshman tried to mediate between pro tibet and pro china protesters on campus
3344528 i really dont know where she is and i think its better for me not to know
3344529 when people cant express themselves in real life what can they do they definitely have to express their anger toward someone im far away they dont know me so they dont feel sorry about it they say whatever they want
3344530 this is just like what happened in the cultural revolution
3344531 think about how deng xiaoping was treated at that time and then in just ten years things had changed completely
3344532 the accumulated desire for expression just like when a flood suddenly races into a breach
3344533 are acutely aware that their country whose resurgence they feel and admire has no principle to guide it
3344534 some of them see that liberalism in the west has lost its belief in itself and they turn to leo strauss for conservatism that is based on principle on natural right this conservatism is distinct from a status quo conservatism because they are not satisfied with a country that has only a status quo and not a principle
3344535 look at the people everyone thinks this is their own olympics
3344536 when i stand here i can feel deeply the common emotion of chinese youth
3344537 im basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things other people actually do
3344538 and somebody else understands it and ill go on record as saying that finding it is the bigger challenge
3344539 the total cost of maintaining a widely used program is typically 40 percent or more of the cost of developing it surprisingly this cost is strongly affected by the number of users

3344541 perfection in design is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but rather when there is nothing more to take away
3344542 having been brought up in a family i entered active life like all young men of my time with a great deal of confidence in the necessity of commanding ordering scolding punishing and the like but when at an early stage i had to manage serious enterprises and to deal with free men and when each mistake would lead at once to heavy consequences i began to appreciate the difference between acting on the principle of command and discipline and acting on the principle of common understanding the former works admirably in a military parade but it is worth nothing where real life is concerned and the aim can be achieved only through the severe effort of many converging wills
3344543 on behalf of everyone at netscape i want to thank you for helping us get to this point in the first place your thinking and writings were fundamental inspirations to our decision

3344548 das trifft auf die strecke zu die fahrer das setup einfach auf alles das wird f r jeden eine gro e herausforderung so schnell wie m glich das beste zu erreichen das rennen wird wohl ziemlich interessant werden
3344549 ich werde mir die onboardaufnahmen des gt rennens ansehen um einen ersten eindruck von der strecke zu bekommen allerdings ist es wirklich eine fahrt ins blaue beim setup wir k nnen uns da aber vielleicht an andere stra enkurse wie monaco anlehnen
3344550 ab diesem punkt m ssen wir uns dann einfach schritt f r schritt das wochenende ber entlanghangeln
3344551 bei einem solchen stra enkurs ist das gro e problem dass man zu beginn einfach keinen grip hat in 15 oder m glicherweise sogar nur zehn runden hast du die strecke drauf aber bei einem stra enkurs brauchst du vielleicht bis zu 20 runden
3344552 ganz wichtig wird sein das auto auf der strecke zu halten denn wer einen unfall baut der verliert enorm viel zeit
3344553 vor einigen monaten haben wir damit begonnen die ersten karten von dieser strecke zu erstellen
3344554 unsere informationen bekamen wir von der fia und entnahmen sie auch den pl nen der architekten so konnten wir eine grobe streckenkarte anfertigen und dann unsere simulationen dar ber laufen lassen damit hatten wir einen ersten eindruck davon welches aerodynamiklevel uns erwarten wie sehr die bremsen beansprucht werden oder wie sehr die rennstrecke die reifen belasten wird
3344555 mit der zeit bekommt man immer mehr informationen von den verantwortlichen und auch von der fia sodass man das urspr ngliche bild weiter erg nzen und die simulationen komplettieren kann
3344556 nat rlich kann das aber nicht den spaziergang rund um die strecke ersetzen wobei man sich die kerbs genau ansieht die auslaufzonen und wie nahe die mauern wirklich sind
3344557 if stoke are serious about jon then they should make an offer if not then they should go away
3344558 it annoys me if it is unsettling jon he is an ipswich town footballer on a three year deal we dont want to sell him we want to keep him
3344559 if stoke are showing serious intent in getting jon then they should do something about it if not they should leave alone and let us get on with it
3344560 jon is a player that other people covet which is good for us because we have taken him from chester and he has done fantastically well
3344561 we have no reason to sell our best players we want to move on to the next level and we see no reason why jon cant help us do that
3344562 i was really impressed with the way theo walcott finished the season
3344563 if people arent demanding hes in the england team theyre writing him off but i think hell develop into a world class player if people just give him some space to express himself
3344564 arsenal are one of the strongest teams we could have met
3344565 but for our young team it will be something special the young players can get a lot of experience in these big matches
3344566 not only now but with one eye on the future
3344567 in the two matches against arsenal we are not just the underdogs but we are very big underdogs
3344568 nobody will expect fc twente to beat arsenal we have nothing to lose
3344569 its all paper talk flying about i am happy at sunderland i dont know if other clubs have made enquiries but like i said i am happy here
3344570 i have spoken to the manager and he wants me to stay he wants me around i am staying put unless they want me out
3344571 the manager is a great guy here and he knows his stuff its onwards and upwards and its always good to see top players coming in
3344572 the objective for us is to improve on last year even if that means improving by one position in the league
3344573 as long as there is an improvement on last season we will all be happy

3344576 mit nur 42 millionen tonnen 3 937 millionen tonnen erreichte
3344577 als folge von investitionen die vor etwa acht bis zehn jahren in die exploration get tigt wurden reicht allein der reservenzuwachs des letzten jahres aus um den derzeitigen weltweiten bedarf von sechs monaten zu decken

3344579 aufgrund dieser hypothese w ren die lreserven 1960 zum ersten mal und im jahr 2000 zum zweiten mal ersch pft gewesen diese vorhersagen haben sich als irrtum erwiesen denn es gibt schwankungen sowohl bei den roh lpreisen als auch beim verbrauch

3344675 alcohol related problems often convene prominently in college sports particularly football and basketball thus we find it ironic that college sports have become such an important venue for marketing beer beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today

3344678 student athletes competing in ncaa sporting events should not be associated with the very product that causes them the most harm and is not in their best interests
3344679 the use of college sports to market beer to millions of college students and other underage fans distorts the values of college sports and the ncaa
3344680 the ncaa continues to put profit over principle by continuing to embrace advertising for beer the number one cause of alcohol problems during its popular sports telecasts
3344681 in contrast the ncaa rejects advertising for distilled spirits most wine sports wagering gambling nightclubs firearms and weapons and nc 17 rated motion pictures among others
3344682 the ncaas rationale for keeping beer ads in its basketball championship and other telecasts comes right out of the beer industrys playbook

3344895 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3344896 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3344897 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3344898 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3344899 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3344953 patience is a virtue try it if you can seldom in a woman never in a man
3344954 there is little chance the monetary policy committee will cut rates in the next few months and indeed there remains a near term risk that the mpc will hike rates if inflation expectations surge higher again
3344955 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3344956 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3344957 i just wanted to be out at the 50 metre point and thats where i was
3344958 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3344959 i knew park is strong in the last 50 metres
3344960 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3344961 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3344962 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history

3344965 it might be once in a century you see something like this

3344970 i dld it and set it to 1 minute to test it out after 6 hours my net was still down and i had to

3344973 i cant believe the comments left here the police break into a house when the owner returns to fin
3344974 well should i ever have to be a victim of police brutality this is the kind of victim i want to be
3344975 everyone who believes this is acceptable should go lay down on the curb and invite passers by to sto
3344976 fwiw i agree with mr banks v vodka also has a point but perhaps his hair covers it just joking

3344981 the fact that the international stagnation forecast at the beginning of the year is now a reality
3344982 the result demonstrates once again the great strength of our classic product lines and the importance of combining these with new strong licenses
3344983 as the bulk of toy sales are concentrated in the closing months of the year there is still a substantial element of doubt about the overall result for the year
3344984 particularly in view of the continued negative economic development which looks like gaining ground
3344985 optimistic about the prospects for the rest of the year
3344986 crude futures have fallen 20 from early july highs any fall from recent peaks is welcome but 115 120 per barrel remains high by any measure sustaining inflationary concerns not least in developing importer countries
3344987 while oecd demand could still surprise us on the downside non oecd prospects particularly for china and the middle east gulf could be subject to upside adjustment

3345003 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3345004 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3345005 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3345006 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3345007 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3345008 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3345009 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3345010 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3345011 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3345025 the first unhcr humanitarian airlift flight carrying relief supplies for civilians affected by the south ossetia conflict arrived in georgia this morning as the estimated number of people uprooted by the fighting approached 100 000
3345026 that would amount to some 56 000 people from gori on the move officials said most had gone toward tbilisi and that most would return home once the threat subsided
3345027 the situation on the ground is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
3345028 we need unrestricted humanitarian access to the civilian population and to the wounded and to enable medical personnel and ambulances to take care of the dead and wounded
3345029 one of our top priorities when it is possible will be to get safe drinking water to tskhinvali
3345030 if this game we should lose from the beginning by 10 points then ok
3345031 but now we can win this game and we did not
3345032 we started the game with good discipline good defense i dont know why but in the fourth quarter we made bad decisions before we started for sure we didnt think that we could win but this situation changed and at that point we should win easy
3345033 we had every chance to win and in the last two or three minutes of regulation time i thought we were winning
3345034 but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory
3345035 but this game shows that we do not have the experience like them when they are losing by 10 points they do not get nervous they just get one point one point and play their way back
3345036 maybe in the last minutes we want to win too much we think about this to much we confused ourselves
3345037 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3345038 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3345039 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3345040 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3345041 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3345042 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3345043 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3345044 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3345045 there is a significant question as to whether permitting the carrying of guns in the airport is a serious threat to the public safety and welfare
3345046 republicans are a little more positive about gas prices than are democrats and independents
3345047 my personal view is that these conditions could continue until 2010 or even 2011 these are most difficult economic circumstances we have ever seen
3345048 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3345049 they are people who love police work and work to do the right thing for the community
3345050 i know i am walking into some issues but there are some really good people here

3345060 other channels for virus introduction including international trade or illegal and unreported movement of poultry

3345065 after we hit the 80 store mark it became clear that we needed a warehouse in order to keep up with demand
3345066 we have ambitious growth targets to reach by 2011 and with our e commerce offering gaining momentum it was essential that we invested in a warehouse management solution that was scalable could grow with the business could help us operate as a leading multi channel retailer and could deliver the visibility and efficiency improvements we needed
3345067 we are delighted to have been selected by empik and look forward to supporting the company as it expands both on the high street and online

3345078 the bottom line is that powers ran war kids relief off a cliff
3345079 our current processor the cattle national bank and trust company was looking to move in a different direction when they came to us with rdsi as their partner we quickly realized the expanded potential of the combined offering we are very excited about this partnership and believe the service and product enhancements will help grow our business

3345081 this is a very positive partnership in the nebraska market rdsis expansion into nebraska is reinforced each time we sign a new client and we welcome battle creek state bank into the family
3345082 its like being a teacher or a kid i had my outfit all ready
3345083 i think to us as adults who are used to starting after labor day it kind of jolts our systems
3345084 you dont have the lag time that we used to have
3345085 and that means they still have the school mentality that a lot of times we didnt have when we started in september
3345086 i think their minds are just like a sponge and they need to keep learning
3345087 if i had to write a poem and i didnt want to mess up i could use this problem pad and erase it
3345088 i would use it problem pad mainly for math problems

3345090 not like the one inside where you have to go searching through everything to find a pencil
3345091 i like the weekly monthly planner because you can write down all your homework assignments
3345092 they come in with ads to all the different stores and have they parents drive around to get the cheapest prices they are even doing the math as they go to see how much they have left to spend that is a big change
3345093 det r uppr rande att kommunen planerar att plocka ner tre gatlyktor i kyrkobyn
3345094 the doctor is in an hour of free advice from frank quattrone
3345095 i do think the industry should petition to remove the spitzer initiatives because ultimately they hurt the competitiveness of our country by denying small companies the access to research analysts
3345096 i am not denying that there is the potential for conflict always has been always will be
3345097 im just questioning the best means of managing the conflict if the principles of what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior are spelled out clearly such as disclosing the firms investment banking relationships and ownership interests in the covered security as well as not publishing favorable reports on companies in which you do not believe and violators are punished the conflicts will be managed
3345098 then they would drink so much that they could not stand up

3345121 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door

3345166 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3345167 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my hope that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3345168 the notes show tojo kept his died in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3345169 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent
3345170 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3345171 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3345172 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3345173 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved
3345174 now that the diplomatic steps have been taken after the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it though i have a separate view
3345175 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be sacrifice for a great cause
3345176 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3345177 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3345178 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3345179 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3345180 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3345181 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3345182 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3345183 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3345184 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3345185 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3345186 die umsetzung der schulstrukturreform in rheinland pfalz geht im vorgesehenen zeitplan voran nach der heutigen abschlie enden beratung im ministerrat wird das landesgesetz zur nderung der schulstruktur nun dem landtag zur beratung und beschlussfassung zugeleitet die neue schulstruktur soll sch lerinnen und sch lern und deren eltern klare wege gute perspektiven sowie bessere f rder und aufstiegsm glichkeiten bieten und damit auch f r mehr chancengleichheit sorgen
3345187 die nach der anh rung unver nderten grundz ge des landesgesetzes sind ab dem schuljahr 2009 2010 k nnen hauptschulen und realschulen landesweit in realschulen plus weiterentwickelt werden
3345188 dieser schritt den wir von anfang an voll mitgetragen haben verbessert die demokratische beteiligung der sch lerinnen und sch ler damit wird eine weitere konsequenz aus den erkenntnissen der landtagsenquetekommission jugend und politik aus der vergangenen legislaturperiode gezogen
3345189 naturgem gab es in der anh rung auch ver nderungsw nsche und nach sorgf ltiger abw gung sind nderungen an dem urspr nglichen gesetzentwurf vorgenommen worden
3345190 mit den vorgesehenen regelungen haben schulaufsicht und schultr ger im einzelfall ausreichend handlungsspielraum ohne die p dagogischen und demografischen aspekte der gesamtreform in frage zu stellen
3345191 schon vor knapp einer woche angek ndigt worden sind die ver nderungen gegen ber der urspr nglichen fassung des gesetzentwurfs bei der schultr gerschaft
3345192 wir wollen dass die qualitative und strukturelle weiterentwicklung unseres schulangebots im mittelpunkt der bildungspolitischen diskussionen steht
3345193 ich freue mich auf eine konstruktive debatte ber dieses zukunftsweisende gesetz im landtag
3345194 ein beispiel f r diese inhaltliche weiterentwicklung ist das projekt keiner ohne abschluss das im detail bei einer tagung am 25 august hier in mainz vorgestellt und diskutiert werden wird
3345195 dies ist nur ein beispiel daf r wie mit der ausgestaltung der neuen schulstruktur auch inhaltlich und p dagogisch neue wege beschritten werden
3345196 die rheinland pf lzischen industrie und handelskammern und handwerkskammern laufen mit ihrer forderung qualifizierten absolventinnen und absolventen einer beruflichen ausbildung den hochschulzugang zu erm glichen bei der landesregierung offene t ren ein
3345197 die qualit t des bildungsangebots in rheinland pfalz wird mit einer reihe von ma nahmen die im heute beginnenden schuljahr 2008 2009 starten konsequent weiterentwickelt
3345198 also das ist ja mal wieder fremdverlagert schr nke zum aufbewahren der b cher echter ganztagsunterricht dann wird es was
3345199 school health nurse einfach ein begr enswertes konzept das schnellstm glich umgesetzt werden sollte
3345200 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3345201 a car driven by a woman was like a goat chased by wolves
3345202 the gangs who kidnapped and car jacked citizens were running everything
3345203 now im comfortable driving my car because i have more freedom the streets are well protected and security forces are deployed everywhere
3345204 driving is very important for women especially these days because it is difficult for woman to use taxis and buses
3345205 i have to depend on myself when my husband isnt around
3345206 they consider women incapable of driving but they cant stop us
3345207 the number is still small compared with the time of the former regime
3345208 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3345209 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3345210 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3345211 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3345212 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3345213 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3345214 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3345215 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3345216 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3345217 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3345218 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3345219 who are open to doing something on the production side
3345220 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3345221 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3345222 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3345223 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3345224 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3345225 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3345226 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3345227 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3345228 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3345229 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3345230 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3345231 it is critical that our students have early and consistent exposure to emerging science and technology fields if they are to be competitive in the 21st century knowledge based economy
3345232 i am glad that i was able to help secure this grant for the institute for advanced learning and research so that teachers in the danville area can become best practice experts in the field of nanotechnology and prepare their students for the possibility of pursuing careers in this area of the 21st century economy
3345233 since the compound eyes of flies are very efficient collectors of light their replicas could also be used to fabricate solar cell covers and other energy harvesting structures as well as lenses offering good spatial resolution
3345234 the development of compound eye based miniature cameras and optical sensors could stimulate applications in automobile engineering credit cards security and surveillance displays and medical technology
3345235 we can work with infrared transparent materials such as chalcogenide glasses to produce infrared microlenses and visible laser hardened infrared sensors as well as photodiodes solar sensors solar concentrators photonic crystals optical bioprobes and so on
3345236 we expect one of the first applications to involve the efficient collection of solar energy in solar cells another early application is likely to be high resolution lenses
3345237 we are making great progress in our mission to deliver light emitting products and technology that will enable significantly improved color quality efficiency and designs for next generation displays and lighting applications
3345238 the combination of a new round of financing new government contracts and ongoing work to design the quantum light lighting product platform into products being developed by some of the largest consumer companies is a clear indication of the companys momentum
3345239 the energy moves forward but the wave that carries the light moves backward
3345240 in order to accelerate breakthrough technologies we believe it is important for students to work on advanced equipment and gain hands on experience working on semiconductor devices
3345241 we are pleased to be part of citris and look forward to working together with students and faculty and to a stronger affiliation with the university
3345242 these advanced systems will be used by our engineering students to accelerate groundbreaking research in semiconductor and related nanofabrication technology that may fuel an array of new discoveries
3345243 we thank applied materials for its continued support as these tools will be valuable to the universitys programs

3345256 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
3345257 the aclu of connecticut opposes juvenile curfews because theyre essentially a violation of fundamental rights of innocent people
3345258 curfews essentially are placing an entire demographic in this case youth under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
3345259 it got to the point where somebody was going to get seriously hurt or killed if we didnt do something
3345260 such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
3345261 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city

3345271 in a cove on an unnamed island opposite red island look for goulburn island to locate approx 30 miles south of bay chimo
3345272 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3345273 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3345274 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3345275 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3345276 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3345277 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3345278 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3345279 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3345280 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3345281 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3345282 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3345283 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3345284 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3345285 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3345286 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3345287 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3345288 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3345289 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3345290 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3345291 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3345292 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3345293 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3345294 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3345295 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3345296 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3345297 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3345298 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3345299 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3345300 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3345301 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3345302 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3345303 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3345304 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3345305 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3345306 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3345307 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3345308 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3345309 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3345310 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3345311 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3345312 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3345313 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3345314 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3345315 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3345316 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3345317 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3345318 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3345319 ocha is extremely concerned by the escalation and the violence the situation is deteriorating on the ground amidst a significant movement of population
3345320 thats why ocha is asking all parties to give humanitarian organisations access to people who are wounded to people who need aid

3345329 hes unavailable at the moment would you like to leave him a voicemail message
3345330 an open war and retaliation for recent military operations in the region
3345331 it is an open war between us and them he said
3345332 we have done it in reaction to the government operations in swat and bajur umar said
3345333 if this kind of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3345334 the recent evaluation of the licensing act showed that it has not led to an increase in crime and disorder
3345335 and in the second half the security staff and marshals on duty inside the stadium kept pestering our players for autographs cigarettes and small change every time we had a corner or throw in
3345336 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3345337 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3345608 the whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none when critics especially on the right accused the media of protecting a democrat because of liberal bias journalists were unable to respond because to do so would be to acknowledge the very thing they were declining to report in the end the much derided msm were superfluous their monopoly a faded memory people have hundreds of ways to obtain information in todays instantaneous media culture and are capable of reaching their own conclusions about what is reliable and what is not
3345609 what else are they not telling us for fear it will hurt the democrats prospects
3345610 it will allow courts to send out a powerful signal that we will not tolerate anything which prevents people who work with the public from going about their jobs
3345611 we have heard this year about staff who work in shops pubs and betting shops facing intimidation and violence
3345612 its time that the law was tilted in their favour

3345618 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
3345619 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
3345620 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
3345621 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
3345622 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
3345623 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
3345624 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
3345625 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
3345626 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
3345627 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

3345631 the thing about this most recent rally is that it has pushed people to look forward unfortunately we still have the current realty with us

3345634 weve identified the source of this issue and fixed it in addition as with all issues that affect gmail and our other services were conducting a full review of what went wrong and moving quickly to update our internal systems and procedures accordingly
3345635 heres something to think about how come you never see a headline like psychic wins lottery
3345636 whos going to be a police officer when they grow up
3345637 were going to quiet it down in the neighborhood people have got to work in the morning
3345638 it still has problems dont get me wrong im not trying to make it like there are no problems and everything is resolved but we are on a much more stable platform than we were a year ago
3345639 we are much more active in the enforcement part of it so of course things are going to go up
3345640 additions to the police force havent had an opportunity to make an impact
3345641 its a slow process and there needs to be a more urgent response
3345642 there is hope the city is finally realizing we do live in a problem area and they are trying to take steps to remedy some of the problems
3345643 the extra police presence that weve had since that last meeting really made a lot of difference i think
3345644 things are really moving they are getting better but its slow
3345645 in reality when you look at those crimes i think most people would agree that these crimes are petty in comparison to homicide in comparison to open air drug markets in comparison to street robberies and other things that are associated with violent crime
3345646 its not just the haves and have nots its two different standards of living there and its clashing
3345647 we repeatedly arrest them and the juvenile justice system is progressive so we repeatedly arrest the same kids over and over basically
3345648 it used to be that there were roving bands of kids running around being inappropriate and being rude and we kind of keep them moving so that doesnt happen
3345649 word is getting out that thats a cool safe place to be and more kids are starting to go there at night
3345650 a small group is terrorizing the area people say if things dont improve they are not going to go to the mall

3345656 politieke radicalen hebben een sterke neiging de wereld in te delen in goed en kwaad zelf zijn zij natuurlijk voor het goede en zij leveren een strijd liefst op leven en dood tegen het kwaad vervolgens wordt ook de mensheid ingedeeld in diegenen die aan de goed en diegenen die aan de verkeerde kant staan met de mensen die aan de verkeerde kant staan daar hebben radicalen meestal weinig medelijden mee

3345689 whether they thought that favre trade was strengthening or not as much as i believe that i can be a strong point for this team that is what they had to look into
3345690 youve got to keep those guys so you cant really fiddle around with that number too much in fact you might have to add a number to it
3345691 as he came through the ranks he was marked that way as a special teams contributor but hes got a chance to be a guy that can contribute on offense too
3345692 marvin did a good job he got open the third play of the game its going to be a touchdown if we pass protect it he caught the ball as it came to him and didnt have any physical problems i think he was pleased with his performance and we were also
3345693 its a whole different role bumping out from guard to tackle
3345694 its a bit easier moving from right to left than for him to go from guard to tackle
3345695 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management
3345696 it definitely had a different atmosphere i couldnt get the camera out of my face in pregame i mean it was all over me it definitely had a different feel
3345697 all i know is that in the past when anythings been taken away from erasmus hes always come back with a vengeance
3345698 and thats the plan he needs to come back with a vengeance wanting to establish himself as a good football player in this league
3345699 little stevie van zandt has already rented out the hard rock caf for a party

3345704 well just see how he finishes this thing out the eagles have invested time and money into their defensive line over the last five years and they need to find another rusher to play opposite of trent cole

3345711 our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese
3345712 altogether 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or metabolically benign obesity
3345713 our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity

3345806 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
3345807 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush

3345818 im not surprised what the other girls have gone the way everyone is swimming here i didnt do myself any favours going out so slow i dont know what im capable of the closer i can get to my best the happier ill be

3345841 study by business professors at villanova university and the college of new jersey inspired by doves campaign for real beauty featuring full bodied women rather than skinny models shows that ads featuring thin models made women feel worse about themselves but better about the brands featured

3345869 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3345870 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3345871 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3345872 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3345873 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3345874 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation

3345882 end the political manipulation of catholic voters it is time to stop creating excuses for pro abortion candidates catholics should no longer be asked to be partners in the abortion regime by voting for politicians who support abortion
3345883 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
3345884 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply said no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us

3345962 apple did not even attempt to answer the questions deferring inquiries to at amp t which declared that there were absolutely no widespread problems with the iphone 3g on its network
3345963 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3345964 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3345965 without detailed testing it is also difficult to say for sure what is causing the dropped calls or limited access to the network most likely the cause of the problem is not solely an at amp t network issue nor is it an apple device issue it is a combination of both
3345966 that suggests either a hand off issue or a capacity issue the hand off between the two networks is supposed to be seamless 3g calls should automatically switch to edge when the 3g signal gets too weak but the iphone 3g seems to be hanging when it switches from the 3g network to the edge network dropping service altogether in some cases apple technicians who examined shaws phone found that 36 percent of his calls had been dropped
3345967 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3345968 this doesnt mean that you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz

3345983 despite economic headwinds the diversity of our global operations enabled us to deliver solid earnings growth
3345984 results were especially strong in latin america where profits were boosted by the currency conversion project in venezuela and improved operating performance in brazil and chile results in europe also improved
3345985 the year to date operating profit margin at brinks was 8 5 percent our full year goal which is to deliver organic revenue growth in the high single digit percentage range with an operating margin of approximately 9 percent has become more challenging but remains achievable
3345986 the global diversity of our operations our investments in technology and value added services and successful execution of our cost reduction efforts should drive sustainable revenue and profit growth
3345987 however if the current weakness in the u s economy persists or spreads further into global markets improving margins will become a greater challenge
3345988 we got the phone call from the contractor who said we have a client that complained
3345989 who never was able to get the fusion research system functioning
3345990 this was one of the first fusion research products to be installed at least from the serial number it looks that way
3345991 we come across racks that we have to clean up fairly often
3345992 but usually things are working better here things really werent working properly
3345993 we got a beautiful deck overlooking the water and we have the lower deck besides that and when people come out and look at the harbour all they see is rusty boats
3345994 removing the two abandoned vessels will eliminate any further potential for environmental or safety hazards and naturally it will free up space at the wharf
3345995 while somebody may determine the vessels environmentally friendly enough to dump at sea i dont think that either one of those vessels look environmentally friendly to the naked eye
3345996 to see them boats gone well hopefully it will make quit a bit of difference
3345997 we thought a couple or three years ago it was going to be done but its a very slow process going through government regulations
3345998 the last thing the government wants to do is be a dumping ground for abandoned vessels
3345999 i had a gentleman in just last week hes on one of the other fishing boats now and he actually cried he said there was some really happy times out there fishing on those boats and that he was really sad to see they were still here

3346018 he looks very good hes flew back from san diego last night to get his visa
3346019 hopefully if he comes back okay we may have a little look at him against everton on saturday
3346020 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3346021 i came here as a young player and was given a chance to play and harry potts and jimmy adamson made me into an international player
3346022 you take on board all their principles and beliefs and ive never lost that
3346023 when i was released by bolton at 19 i came here where there were all these fantastic international players who all had their feet on the ground
3346024 there were no egos and they welcomed me into the dressing room a nobody from a second division club
3346025 because i was released and went on to play at the top level i can pass on that experience
3346026 it was a very easy decision to make to come back its a long time since i was last here as a player i left in 1984 to become manager of bury but its come full circle
3346027 i used to ask people at bury people like lee dixon david lee jamie hoyland and andy hill what their ambition was
3346028 it cut me to the bone theres no getting away from that and its been a very long weekend
3346029 disappointment is an under statement we would have never envisaged that start to the season being 2 0 down after three and a half minutes but it happened and its how we deal with it and well leave no stone unturned to make sure we rectify it
3346030 i think thats the beauty of football youve always got an opportunity to address what went before
3346031 as much as im hurt i know everyone at the football club is the supporters and everybody connected with it its important we go to bury in good heart ready to go and get a victory and progress in the cup competition
3346032 as much as its horrible and hurtful youre always going to get a kick in the teeth or a slap in the face in football its how you react to it
3346033 there are good players here theres no doubt about that but they have to show it when they go out onto the pitch
3346034 ive been there before with training ground internationals when you cross the white line and the fans are there you have to go and deliver
3346035 thats when youre judged on being a good player not in training when theres nobody there to watch you and you can do a trick here and there its when people are there and points are at stake thats when youll be judged
3346036 so its up to the players now to get to that level and show it consistently
3346037 i always as a player coach manager or whatever love cup competitions
3346038 ive been on both sides of it as a favourite and an underdog
3346039 tonight theres no doubt we go there as favourites and bury will be boosted by their own result at the weekend and probably see us as a big scalp to take so we have to make sure were at our best well give them every respect but look to try to impose ourselves in the game and play our style
3346040 any cup competition gives you the opportunity to want to have an extended run for the prestige and the glamour that goes with it but equally if you can get a decent run against some bigger clubs with decent gates theres obviously a financial impact as well
3346041 we want to make sure we do both but to do that we have to overcome a very tricky game but its one well be ready for and were looking forward to it
3346042 im just delighted theres a game because it would have been a very long week without it it gives us a chance to go and bring all our qualities to the game and first and foremost were going to have defend a lot better theres no getting away from that the goals you wouldnt have seen them on a school playing field on a saturday which is frustrating because as much as it might not have looked like it wed worked all week on the back four
3346043 when you sign players people automatically think theyre going to be playing
3346044 when i was at bolton and bruce rioch signed gary parkinson from middlesbrough and brought him in to be the right back
3346045 but gary never played a game because phil brown was revitalised because he saw it as a challenge stepped his game up and gary never played for two years
3346046 so much so that he ended up leaving the club because he couldnt get in because of brownys form thats what happens sometimes
3346047 christians done nothing wrong hes actually done very well but stephen jordan stepped his game up in pre season and it was one of those decisions that you have to make
3346048 that applies to everybody when you bring players in if other players ante up and show that level of consistency then theyll play
3346049 we dont keep the fingerprint image just the data which we use to construct an algorithm
3346050 theres a lot of activity going on and the market is beginning to see some widespread adoption that will actually touch consumers
3346051 there are a lot of advantages the primary ones are efficiencies of cost for the merchant and convenience for the consumer
3346052 the challenge is having a workable cost effective system the opportunity cost can be high because money could always be spent on other more proven technologies
3346053 stores are thinking it makes customers move through faster but the value proposition for customers is different and not as convincing
3346054 the bottom line is does it really enhance the customer experience enough to make them bother with it
3346055 there are more than 30 million users out there using our technology but about half of those are outside the united states
3346056 in places like latin america europe and africa people dont have this notion of big brother watching
3346057 fingerprint authentication is the most convenient way to replace a password for logging into computers networks or web sites
3346058 we dont keep the fingerprint image just the data which we use to construct an algorithm
3346059 in our current discussions were trying to figure out which are the right applications to use the fingerprint readers
3346060 this is often one of the things that really misleads some organizations
3346061 they see the successful use of biometrics in one application and believe it should apply to another we see organizations invest in one area because of a success in a noncomparable application when in fact the same success criteria often dont apply
3346062 why do we think we can try to change what god created without disrespecting the creator
3346063 part of showing the love of god is to care for creation mans first profession was to tend the garden
3346064 when a child marks a piece of paper with crayons you hang it on the refrigerator no matter what you think of it
3346065 simple living is kind of one of those deep brethren values
3346066 part of simple living is to live in harmony with everybody else and with nature
3346067 when you walk across this it is a lot cooler even the walkways
3346068 they were trying to make me triple all my estimates which would have resulted in 10 000 to 12 000 more in development fees
3346069 si alguno de ustedes pierde una oveja de las cien que tiene no deja las otras noventa y nueve en el desierto y se va en busca de la que se le perdi hasta que la encuentra

3346072 we are delighted that this transfer to the united church schools trust the preferred party has been achieved so quickly as it is likely that this safeguards the future operation of the school
3346073 were just enjoying our time we are just recently very recently engaged so we are just taking it easy
3346074 i mean im 23 there is no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
3346075 im so fortunate to be in a very solid and comfortable relationship
3346076 im in a good place in my life right now im a really big believer in loving yourself before you can give love to somebody else
3346077 the healthiest and most inspiring relationships are the ones where youre so comfortable with the other person that you actually learn more about yourself that you could never appreciate before
3346078 the violence between russia and georgia quickly thrust foreign policy into the u s presidential election with john mccain standing to benefit and barack obama facing a more perilous situation
3346079 as such the conflict gave sen obama the opportunity to show that he is indeed prepared but it also gave prominence to foreign policy one of the few areas where polling shows that sen mccain has a clear advantage with voters
3346080 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and has now violated the space of another country
3346081 obamas campaign made two early missteps first in its initial statement it called for restraint from both russia and georgia then obamas campaign released a statement questioning mccains objectivity in the crisis because a top mccain aide randy scheunemann had lobbied for the georgians
3346082 radio continuum vla observations of this nebula show free free emission from three stellar sources lying close to the o7 v star at the center of the nebula we argue that neutral material associated with these stars is photoionized externally by the uv radiation from the hot central star we also report the discovery of a barrel shaped supernova remnant at the northwest rim of the nebula and two shell like features
3346083 we also note a remarkable complex of filamentary and sheetlike structures that appear to arise from the edge of a protostellar condensation these observations are consistent with a picture in which the bright massive star hd 164492a is responsible for the photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks of other less massive members of the cluster as well as the closest protostellar condensation facing the central cluster
3346084 the trifid nebula is a young h ii region undergoing a burst of star formation
3346085 inspection of their physical properties suggest that they are similar to the dust protostellar cores observed in orion although at an earlier evolutionary
3346086 my family has been in the recycling and scrap business in the area for years and i am able to trade on that knowledge and really help grow this business
3346087 we are delighted to add zack to our team due to his background he will be able to immediately help our customers and expand our business opportunities
3346088 his passion for this business and his outgoing personality make him a perfect fit for turtle wings
3346089 greetings my friend we are all interested in the future for that is where you and i are going to spend the rest of our lives
3346090 transhumanism is the idea that its ok to transcend the limitations of the body and brain and take control of reproduction
3346091 and add to that the belief that its probably a good idea
3346092 within 30 years we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence shortly thereafter the human era will be ended
3346093 you might get things in the next 10 or 20 years that would have taken 200 years before
3346094 i guess my real motivation is the desire to not have a lot of clutter around me and just have one computer or one brain interface
3346095 the more tangible advantage of the efficiency is that you could have better emergency responses and better human experiences
3346096 eating kind of distracts me from whatever else im doing
3346097 im kind of weird that way im more concerned with my health than how things taste ive always cared about maximizing my happiness
3346098 it goes back to the enlightenment about 400 years or so
3346099 and when you go back to those original ideas you see a number of things emerging among them the notion that science and tech can be applied to human affairs and things can be engineered and improved upon
3346100 our paleolithic selves had certain limitations and invented technologies to allow us to get beyond them for us theres continuity between what happened then and what were talking about now
3346101 there are some guys who put a lot of faith in the code
3346102 others of us are more interested in the social dimension and global collaboration there are a lot of different baggages we bring to these things
3346103 theres been more than half a century of research indicating that caloric restriction in animal models works
3346104 it goes back to studies in the 1940s that show that if you feed laboratory animals less calories they live much longer and age better
3346105 thats basically the production of molecules that can damage the body
3346106 theyre molecules that can oxidize proteins or dna all the major building blocks of cells and bodies the thought is that the more we eat and the longer we live the more we damage these cells and if you eat less then you create less damage
3346107 there are people who believe in this and are doing it
3346108 the problem is they dont appear particularly happy or healthy on the question of quality of life its very difficult most people would be miserable
3346109 the french eat all these fats breads cheeses and do lots of things they shouldnt do and they actually live longer and have less disease than we do in north america
3346110 and its been proposed that they live longer because they drink a lot of red wine and its not just the wine but the red pigment actually seems to have beneficial properties
3346111 there appears to be a connection between that compound and slowing down oxidation damage
3346112 in other words theres now for the first time the potential for having a drug that will mimic the effects of things that no one wants to do like caloric restriction or severe exercise itll be a drug well all happily pay a lot of money to pop down and the pharmaceutical industry will happily make a killing on it
3346113 i think we have a 50 percent chance of getting there in around 25 years so long as the early proof of concept work in mice is well enough funded for the next 10 years or so
3346114 the sens concept is inspired by the realization that human metabolism is far too complex and interconnected to improve bio medically in the foreseeable future and that an alternative akin to repair and maintenance of man made machines is far more promising
3346115 as soon as we get that gerontologists the world over will be on television saying yes aubrey was right the repair and maintenance approach to postponing aging really is feasible after all
3346116 the debate is largely framed by transhumanists who are looking for rationales for all the enhancement technologies
3346117 and its framed on the other side by people largely motivated by religious or conservative concerns those people are either fearful of this technology or see it as a rallying cry for conservative social positions
3346118 thats based on a lot of assumptions that we really dont know about the brain
3346119 astori tiene que pasar de actuar de una manera de economista de intelectual a actuar m s como pol tico
3346120 mujica es pol tico tiene el saber del pol tico el saber del caudillo la capacidad para cambiar mutar
3346121 astori es popular entre los uruguayos en general pero no en la interna del fa
3346122 we used to have guys coming out of the walls
3346123 it was the thing to do back then volunteer and help the community
3346124 probably only five guys still live in darby guys who grew up in darby keep coming back
3346125 they join when theyre young but then they get married
3346126 it used to be a lifetime commitment very few make it 20 years anymore
3346127 whats missing in manpower we make up for in mutual aid
3346128 there hasnt been a time when we had to scratch a call
3346129 they jacked up the cost to the taxpayers and they got rid of alex
3346130 we congratulate the iaff for its commitment to this campaign and look forward to working together toward the goal of a smoke free union
3346131 fire fighters are respected leaders in their communities and this program on smoking cessation reaffirms that leadership
3346132 fire fighters place themselves in harms way confront dangerous environments high heat and flames and exposure to burning materials
3346133 its stressful work and some respond to stress by smoking yet smoking increases the health risks fire fighters face we want to help prevent that
3346134 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a binding agreement until that happens we are mobilised we are prepared for everything
3346135 there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3346136 i have members of my caucus who are single parents who feel very strongly that they deserve a pay raise
3346137 the last thing they should be doing is giving themselves pay raises
3346138 this is such a tough job you know i think its fair to say i have fewer friends now than i had before i was governor
3346139 emil and i are homeboys man there are times i consider myself the first african american governor of illinois
3346140 to explain why the amendments requested by the equal opportunities commission have not been drafted introduced
3346141 we are seeing a lot of the demand driven from the financial services industry for these internal grid computing and cloud type computing applications
3346142 you have cloud computing or utility computing within a company and thats where were seeing a lot of the demand especially from the financial services industry where they are ratcheting up and down computing power for different applications especially highly computational type applications and risk management and derivatives pricing and such
3346143 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
3346144 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
3346145 they do not want someone who would be the first mama
3346146 but there is a yearning for a kind of tough single parent
3346147 bill gates once asked me could you make me more human
3346148 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3346149 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
3346150 in two of the films hughes picked a tune that had tenderness in the title try a little tenderness otis redding singing with jon cryer lip synching a classic scene
3346151 one of the things i learned re watching these films is that hughes puts in a scene completely untouched that even lacks a lot of the flash of the rest of the movie that says this is the point of the film here it is
3346152 so try a little tenderness is absolutely what its all about
3346153 there is neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
3346154 we are all a brain an athlete a basket case a princess and a criminal
3346155 duckie is a lot like a lot of us and i think thats why a lot of us like him
3346156 were all able to say it its supposed to be about tenderness the world should be kind this should be loving i have a great friend and im in love with her and this should be working why isnt it working and so we rant and we push and eventually we come around if were kind thats the thing if were tender with ourselves eventually well come around he has to learn that lesson
3346157 theyre searching and theyre seeking i think he understood that about kids that theyre not devoid of a spiritual existence they just dont engage in the religious institutions theyre doing it all outside of them these kids are unmoored theyre rootless its interesting
3346158 the congregation really wants me to try it with my cousin vinny
3346159 the joke at church yesterday was that the next series should be all fellini films wow ok maybe well do that in lent
3346160 a lot of us believe that the best church can do is reinterpret using pop culture tools to make its own art
3346161 i think people really need to have god pointed out where they live they need encouragement to see it because they want to
3346162 you have more of a chance of getting kicked to death by mules than of being in a plane crash
3346163 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3346164 there are many foreign elements there more than local militants
3346165 we have decided to temporarily suspend baku supsa as a precautionary measure we are monitoring the situation in georgia and will restart the pipeline when it becomes clear it can work safely
3346166 this is an accident and we expect to follow appropriate procedures under international rules
3346167 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3346168 eles podem escolher ir a um deles mas n o a todos
3346169 podia ter sido mais eu estou muito chateado o meu total normal maior que isso n o sei o que faltou
3346170 meu joelho torceu um pouco no movimento e n o insisti
3346171 ur making urself look desparate find a guy whos interested
3346172 its like having two families being part of two cultures
3346173 i have things to say about america and things to say about india but i dont feel a difference in the sense that you carry both of those worlds within you
3346174 i think my style may be a little different from other indian writers writing in english
3346175 but its not that different i know my book was liked and appreciated in india even the physical appearance was commented on they really liked it
3346176 in fact im one of those people who resist it for me it works against my creative process these are things that sort of land and stay in my memory
3346177 im just beginning and still need to develop as a writer but there is something very real happening here
3346178 i improved my result because of the training which focused on me relaxing i want to make the final and improve my result
3346179 i thought maybe 2 07 would be okay for the semi final but they swam very quickly in the heats so i swam faster too but at the end i saved my power
3346180 its only a heat i probably took it out a little slower than i usually would have and didnt put in as much effort as i should have knowing how fast heats have been going here
3346181 eles podem escolher ir a um deles mas n o a todos

3346185 o my gosh paul marsiano called today to see if i got his books also im gonna go to san antonio to do photo shoot

3346298 understanding your strategies for coping with the changing pharmacy benefit landscape
3346299 emerging developments in the pharmaceutical industry are challenging employers to revisit their drug benefit strategy
3346300 unprecedented availability of inexpensive generics and the emergence of new very expensive specialty medications are two of the trends driving this strategy review

3346303 in terms of long term cost control strategies employers plan on heavy employee involvement
3346304 managing these specialty drugs will be key to future cost containment strategies for employers
3346305 and its interesting that when asked which tools are used to manage specialty medication therapies less than 10 percent mentioned either discontinuation of unsuccessful therapy payer communication or family involvement

3346447 experts that we interviewed unanimously agree that the treatment of type 1 diabetes is characterized by a high level of unmet need for therapies that can halt the destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta cells
3346448 immunomodulators have the potential to preserve beta cell function but their use will be hampered by long term safety concerns high prices and by the small number of eligible patients who would benefit from these agents
3346449 we continued to make excellent progress in the second quarter as demand outpaced our production capacity this allowed us to selectively fill more orders with high gross margins
3346450 in the first full quarter in which all 60 of our high precision lathe machines were installed and operational we were able to fill additional orders from our existing customers

3346459 theres no crystal ball in agriculture but when you walk through these research fields its as close as you come to seeing the future in agriculture
3346460 within one farm you see the technologies that already exist and have the potential to rewrite the agricultural landscape next year and 10 years from now planted side by side based on our innovation we have the potential to double yields for our customers in corn cotton and soybeans by 2030
3346461 with what we have in hand today were in a position to widen our lead over the competition with acceleration beginning with 25 percent to 30 percent gross profit growth in our corn business in fiscal year 2009
3346462 new technology rewrites historical assumptions about yield and thats exactly the case with roundup ready 2 yield soybeans
3346463 we expect roundup ready 2 yield to be delivered on time as promised and with a step change in yield thats equivalent to almost a decades worth of breeding gains

3346484 to give him a better chance to work on all of his pitches
3346485 i order the working group not to stop at the achieved results and to look what we can improve in the code project
3346486 from our point of view the working group in the concept and project of new tax code offers outdated methods which do not have any innovations in reality they have a character of changes and amendments into acting tax code but not a new tax code which was ordered by the president of the country
3346487 such steps will inevitably bring to adoption of new next and numerous laws on property and money legalization
3346488 the declaration will make officials think carefully before taking a bribe as far as it will make him explain the source of revenues
3346489 we offer to cancel checks of small and medium business while presentation of claims to tax bearers should be establish ed on the base of results of strictly regulated measures of cameral control

3346497 in supporting the childrens museum gnmo is making a real difference in childrens lives in upstate south carolina were fortunate to have ongoing support from members of the business community who understand the value of creating a place where children and adults can learn and play together
3346498 doubts have grown over the last year about whether the re use of mss spectrum in terrestrial networks referred to as ancillary terrestrial components or atc will ever happen the proposed merger of skyterra and inmarsat will go a long way towards making the deployment of atc in north america more feasible however wireless operators may not have any reason to focus on potential atc spectrum acquisitions until the level of demand for 4g data services such as clearwires wimax deployment is better understood which will take until late 2010 as a result we believe that harbinger may need to invest billions of dollars in a wireless operator in order to facilitate an earlier partnership while the core mss business of operators like iridium and inmarsat remains strong particular in maritime and aeronautical services the level of demand for the integrated satellite terrestrial services proposed by skyterra is uncertain widespread consumer acceptance of such services will be critical if harbinger is ultimately to realize a return on its investments in the mss sector
3346499 we showed everyone the heart and soul of this team
3346500 we couldnt wait to get into a game and get this thing started were so sick of practice
3346501 we always lose by four or five runs we should have done better
3346502 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3346503 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3346504 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3346505 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3346506 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3346507 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3346508 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3346509 the most difficult lie i have ever contended with is this life is a story about me
3346510 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3346511 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3346512 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3346513 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3346514 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3346515 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3346516 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3346517 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3346518 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3346519 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3346520 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3346521 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3346522 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3346523 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3346524 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3346525 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3346526 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3346527 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3346528 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3346529 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3346530 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3346531 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3346532 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3346533 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3346534 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3346535 ruska dejanja spro ajo resna vpra anja o njihovih namerah v gruziji

3346539 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3346540 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3346541 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

3346545 it was a great ride for a lot of investors but eventually the music stopped and someone had to pay the piper

3346550 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3346551 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3346552 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3346553 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3346554 were not as worried about the flash flooding as we are about the instability of the ground and the slumping and the cracks appearing all along that entire
3346555 relocating our headquarters to new york allows us to more readily access our significant and growing presence in indianapolis indiana our domestic and international customer base as well as allowing us closer proximity to our institutional investors
3346556 new york is one of the few cities to offer such a unique global platform
3346557 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3346558 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3346559 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3346560 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3346561 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3346562 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3346563 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3346564 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3346565 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3346566 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3346567 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3346568 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3346569 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3346570 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3346571 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3346572 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3346573 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3346574 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3346575 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3346576 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3346577 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3346578 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3346579 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3346585 yeah buddy im sooooo sure i can take your lane from you im going to signal to rub it in your face
3346586 this guys trying to get in front of me id better speed up
3346587 car buying is more emotional than buying most things more emotional than buying perfume a new house 5 000 stereo equipment and so on
3346588 the first piece of advice is the boy scout motto be prepared
3346589 and theres no reason why you cant be prepared because everything you need to know you can find on the internet
3346590 you know what you can afford you know what you think your payments should be you know what your financing options are you know the car you want
3346591 so youre in a pretty strong confident position when you go in there and the dealer will know that you have that information
3346592 the payments on a lease tend to be lower but you dont own the car but if you are the type of person that always wants to be driving a brand new vehicle and perhaps even a higher end vehicle and you want lower payments leasing is an option for you
3346593 usually the mileage is limited to 12 000 to 15 000 a year and then you have to pay over that
3346594 and there are some vehicles that you cant lease and it is also dependent on depreciation if it is prone to depreciation the payments cover the cost of depreciation
3346595 you may be looking at a new honda accord but you have a hankering for a bmw or an audi and you might want to go onto a web site and see how much a 2006 bmw goes for and that may end up being a better deal for you than a new vehicle
3346596 its a much more pleasant and efficient process to submit a request for a certain kind of vehicle have that dealer call you back or e mail you or offer a price or you can ask the dealer for more information
3346597 you can say yes or no and then you can walk into the dealership and do the paperwork
3346598 the shorter the period of the loan the less interest you are going to pay
3346599 you can also see some manufacturers that offer zero percent interest for vehicles that they are anxious to move but you have to be very careful to understand what the fees are and what you are putting up front
3346600 the dealer really wants to make room for those newer vehicles that are going to be coming onto his lots so he has more of an incentive to move the older models off his lots and that puts him in a better position to make a good deal
3346601 if you know that the trade in value of your vehicle is you are armed with that knowledge before you walk into the dealership then you are in a powerful position

3346652 what there is to lose is the stability of the framework that the u s thought was going to govern the post cold war world when one country conquers another thats typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not all that accustomed to

3346720 how long before married people answer the dictators thus regardless of law marriage has only one definition and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy i will act to destroy that government and bring it down so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn
3346721 omg im lyk so depressed im gona scratch my arm with a safety pin
3346722 it expects everyone to dress well and be on time
3346723 im on ecstasy give me water or else me and the kid will die
3346724 im all for boobies vodka tonics dirty panties and strippers the reason being that they rock especially when combined
3346725 gay is unnatural and brings no children thus endangering our existance
3346726 just thought id mention its not that god hates gays god loves everyone gays rapists murderers jerks at the coffee shop everyone its that being gay or a rapist or a murderer or a jerk is a slap in gods face its breaking his rules hell always forgive us but cmon why be an ass hes a great guy and he deserves a bit more respect

3346736 liberty and justice for all unless youre gay non christian or enter an airport
3346737 i agree with o s card that the traditional family of husband wife and children has been taken for granted and abused to the point of it almost being abandoned
3346738 look i really dont think that the government should redefine marriage as a matter of fact i think the government should get out of the marriage business entirely in my opinion the government should only do civil unions and churches should only do marriages
3346739 the thing is marriage is considered to be a religious insitution
3346740 all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws
3346741 whats next if the states cannot define marriage for themselves then i guess anyone wanting to marry their own 10 year old daughter son must be allowed to do so that may sound ridiculous but think about it if gays are going going to say the state cannot restrict them from being married then hell the pedophile parents of these kids can claim the same exact argument logic be damned
3346742 the first and greatest threat from court decisions in california and massachusetts giving legal recognition to

3346758 edf is a perfect example where this french company is limited under law from raising fuel prices in france but edf can hit british families with massive increases
3346759 the government needs to do more for the uk housing market by reducing or removing stamp duty and they should kickstart house building by announcing a massive increase in new council houses
3346760 these are the bold moves which would show the electorate the government is listening and is prepared to act these measures would go along way towards reconnecting labour with its core voters

3346771 in molti si sono gettati in acqua per recuperarlo ma purtroppo luomo era gi morto non mi era mai accaduto di vedere una persona affogata in acqua
3346772 per la verit non ho mai visto una persona morta in circostanze tragiche e sono rimasto molto colpito io e mia moglie abbiamo cercato per quanto possibile di non far vedere la scena ai nostri due ragazzi ma anche loro sono rimasti molto colpiti tanto che abbiamo deciso di tornarcene a casa anche per rispetto alluomo deceduto
3346773 i have to comment on the phenomenon in japan of the japan from what i do know young women from good families often enter the workplace with the expectation that they will leave once they find a husband and get married which is in part why companies in japan still dont take womens careers seriously and rarely promote them
3346774 the 20 something years for these women are also marked by a sense of freedom they take lovers they travel they buy frivolous things and some experiment with drugs or indulge in other obvious signs of rebellion like dyeing their hair hot pink with the expectation that all of this will soon come to an end with marriage and after marriage they will somehow live happily keeping a tidy home and raising children in the suburbs
3346775 the thing thats striking about this model is that its not that far from american society and its expectations for women pre 1970s and in fact there are still women who grow up wanting to live this model of womanhood though its more and more rare that a woman of any marital status in the u s can stop working even if she wanted to simply for economic reasons
3346776 but i was shocked to find that japan is actually running its own smear campaign against working unmarried women who buck tradition and stay in their jobs past the age of 30
3346777 your life is on the line every day and you are trading what you do for it in other words life is a series of trade offs and every monent is literally spent time and therefore our lives are traded for the things that we choose to do
3346778 in every adversity there is a seed equivelent to a greater benefit
3346779 the word enlightment conjures up the idea of superhuman accomplishment but its simply your natural state of felt oneness with being its a state of connectedness with something that is essentially you and yet is much greater than you it is finding your true nature beyond name and form

3346789 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3346790 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3346791 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3346792 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3346793 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3346794 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3346795 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3346796 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets

3346802 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3346803 if we have received the order to ceasefire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance
3346804 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens

3346806 until the kashmir dispute is resolved the anti india sentiments will stay the protests should open the eyes of indians that kashmiris are not with them

3346819 ive been doing the bbq central show in some form or fashion for a little over 2 years
3346820 tv has their cooking shows but there is no program on talk radio that addresses this industry on a regular basis and i am changing that
3346821 i put in a lot of work during the week to make sure my show content is enjoyable to both the novice bbqer and to the folks on the competition circuit i dont ask my guests the same old questions everyone else does i want the good stuff that you dont usually get out of them i think the listeners enjoy that aspect of my show
3346822 i pride myself on my ability to work off a structured environment but also have the skills to go off the top of my head if the opportunity presents itself

3346827 there is no question that the current housing market has created problems for some families and tremendous opportunities for others
3346828 there are so many fantastic buying opportunites out there right now im personally trying to raise 10 million in capital to expand my own investment portfolio
3346829 absolutely but i also believe that for those that do not they may fail to include into their buying decision the vital role that population trends have on our economy and the county in which we live it is by carefully analyzing these figures that we can reasonably predict future housing demands
3346830 with an increase in future housing demands and a limited supply of land to build on existing home prices are likely to appreciate in the foreseeable future
3346831 investors recognize this and are patient enough to wait awhile to reap the rewards your average homebuyer is more emotionally connected with the day to day value versus the future value thus missing out on future equity appreciation
3346832 population has increased by 36 6 since 2000 making prince william county the states second most populous county

3346869 everything has changed whats the world coming to when a man cant even tend his yard without a reporter asking him why hes doing it
3346870 no one knows what the city is going to do
3346871 i cant get a straight answer from our insurance company and the federal programs seem to be linked to what the insurance companies decide weve done what we can got our stuff that wasnt ruined out and tried to gut the worst of the damage now we wait and see if we have something that were going to be able to save
3346872 we are still at the point where we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg
3346873 there are beginning to be increased calls from some of the service providers but its still too early to even get a handle on what we think volume is going to be
3346874 the timing has to do with the fact that there are basic concrete things that individuals focus on first
3346875 there is that whole initial phase of shock but then people move on to the nuts and bolts of finding out what they can do with their property there are certain phases to disaster cycles that people go through and that the communities go through
3346876 people are starting to get the economic information now and unfortunately there arent going to be quick answers to the government buy out situation or to questions about the fate of specific neighborhoods
3346877 some people may now know or will soon learn how much they are eligible for through the government programs insurance or other programs many times there are going to be gaps so the financial realities start to become very evident thats when people start to see just how difficult this is going to be
3346878 a lot of people do fine day to day while everything is clicking along particularly on a financial level when they have jobs and money coming in
3346879 those individuals may not have needed any extra support or extra assistance in terms of mental or behavioral health needs but if theyve now lost their job even those individuals who did not experience the flood at their residence but their business or place of employment was affected and there is no longer any income that situation is going to create additional stress that may be just enough to create additional problems elsewhere in their life so historically that person may not have needed extra assistance but this was just one more thing that may tip the scale
3346880 i think in terms of the man mowing the yard around his damaged house that this was probably the one thing he could control
3346881 you know he could make his yard look nice it could also be that that was an activity that he particularly enjoyed ive heard people remark as theyve been out looking at the flood affected neighborhoods about how nice the yards look just look at how nice that yard looks they obviously want back in their home they have so much pride in this piece of property my guess would be that it makes these individuals feel better to do something to have control over one aspect of whats going on when people can do something concrete it makes them feel like they are moving forward
3346882 perhaps you are a person that has typically read novels for enjoyment but now you find that you cant concentrate or focus on what youre reading
3346883 when you can no longer find enjoyment in the things that you previously like to do that can signal problem
3346884 by that same token some individuals may respond by engrossing themselves in books or whatever they find enjoyable that can be a problem too when it is being used as a way to completely escape and not deal with the current reality
3346885 youd be amazed how much it can help to just tell someone else what you are going through

3346952 we talked so much from this team being put together with paul on it with morgan on it from being family
3346953 we are a family its all about this family and we took that out on the floor with us even i think sasha in terms of how great hes been on the floor he knows that hes not out there by himself he knew no matter what we love you weve got your back unconditionally and we just talked about that so much
3346954 i think they wanted to show people we can do something
3346955 when paul and morgan stepped away from competing for this team i think everyone thought this team doesnt have a chance at a medal these guys believed it they knew we believed in it their families believed in it they believed it and they wanted this so desperately
3346956 i certainly wanted to for myself to step down but these guys said we want you on the floor
3346957 and thats why without an athlete on the floor i went out on the floor with these guys they wanted me as a part of that family on the floor and so i went out there with them and everything came to fruition it was absolutely amazing
3346958 i heard two of these guys jon and kevin say this feels like an ncaa championship
3346959 it felt like that and in terms of support of one another that is how an ncaa team works and these guys brought that to this olympics

3346973 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it workedperfectly
3346974 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3346975 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3346976 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3346977 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3346978 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3346979 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3346980 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3346981 but the big question remains what happens in the real world of human cancers
3346982 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
3346983 no currently available method enables the real time detection of possible central nervous system cns tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter
3346984 small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle fat and vertebrae the research lays the foundation for development of a prototype device allowing real time monitoring of cns tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts
3346985 the experiments by our collaborators at the university of california san diego demonstrated that this mechanism is present and our theory explained why and how it happens
3346986 the gap in understanding of single bond and multiple bond breaking processes is just incredible
3346987 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3346988 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3346989 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3346990 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past
3346991 what is surprising is that such effects may pop up seventy or eighty years after birth
3346992 sesungguhnya sebaik baik pembicaraan adalah kalamullah dan sebaik baik petunjuk adalah petunjuk rasulullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam dan sejelek jelek perkara adalah menambah nambah dalam urusan agama dan setiap perkara baru dalam agama adalah bidah dan setiap bidah adalah sesat dan setiap kesesatan nerakalah tempatnya
3346993 ketahuilah bahwa tiada illah yang haq disembah melainkan allah maka mohonlah ampunan bagi dosamu
3346994 dan kami hadapi segala amalan yang mereka kerjakan lalu kami jadikan amalan itu bagaikan debu yang berterbangan
3346995 padahal mereka tidak di suruh kecuali menyembah allah dengan memurnikan ketaatan kepadanya dalam menjalankan agamanya dengan lurus
3346996 jika kamu benar benar mencintai allah maka ikutilah aku niscaya allah akan mengasihimu
3346997 there cant be just one true religion they are all the same
3346998 each religion sees part of spiritual truth but none can see the whole truth
3346999 all religions are equally valid and basically teach the same thing
3347000 religious belief is too culturally and historically conditioned to be the truth
3347001 the shooting death of a canadian soldier this weekend provides a grim example of how chaotic the security situation can often be in southern afghanistan
3347002 according to coalition military officers a convoy that included groups from two different security companies compass and uspi was traveling the main highway west of kandahar when they passed a group of canadian soldiers engaged in a firefight with taliban fighters in the spin beer district
3347003 their normal contact drill is that as soon as they get hit with something then its 360 open up on anything that moves
3347004 freely admitted to opening fire on what they thought were taliban fighters but when informed that a canadian soldier had been wounded their stories began to change and many never claimed to have fired at all some of the security guards blamed the afghan army for the incident

3347008 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3347009 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3347010 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3347011 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3347012 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3347013 and our analysis bore this out in the past five years sri funds returned 11

3347020 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3347021 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3347022 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3347023 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3347024 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3347025 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3347026 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production

3347052 saya tidak pernah mengetahui seorang pun di atas bumi ini yang lebih alim dalam bidang hadits pada masa kini yang mengungguli syaikh albani rahimahullah
3347053 syaikh albani adalah mujaddid zaman ini dalam dugaanku wallahu alam
3347054 ahli hadits negeri syam pemilik ilmu yang sangat luas tentang hadits secara riwayah dan dirayah allah taala menganugerahkan manfaat yang banyak kepada manusia melalui karya karya ilmiahnya berupa ilmu dan semangat mempelajari ilmu hadits
3347055 imam ahli hadits saya belum mendapati seorang pun yang menandinginya di zaman ini
3347056 syaikh al allamah al muhaddits muhammad nashiruddin al albani saya tidak menjumpai orang pada abad ini yang menandingi kedalaman penelitian haditsnya
3347057 bila syaikh albani berbeda hukum denganku dalam masalah shahih dan dhaifnya hadits maka saya menetapkan pendapatnya karena saya percaya kepadanya baik dari segi ilmu dan agama
3347058 telah sampai sepucuk surat kepada syaikh ubaidullah ar rahmani ketua jamiah as salafiyah dan penulis miraah al mafaatih syarah misykah al mashahib sebuah pertanyaan dari lembaga fatwa riyadh saudi arabia tentang hadits yang sangat aneh lafaznya agung maknanya dan memiliki korelasi erat dengan zaman kita maka seluruh ulama di sini semua bersepakat untuk mengajukan pertanyaan tersebut kepada seorang ahli hadits yang paling besar abad ini yaitu syaikh al albani rahimahullah alim rabbani
3347059 ini merupakan kejahilan yang sangat dan pelecehan yang keterlaluan karena kehebatan ilmu al albani dan perjuangannya membela sunnah dan aqidah salaf sangat populer dalam hati para ahli imu tidak ada yang mengingkari hal itu kecuali musuh yang jahil
3347060 bumi ini tidak pernah sepi dari para ulama tetapi pada zaman ini saya tidak mengetahui mereka kecuali hanya sedikit saya sebut secara khusus diantara mereka adalah al allaamah abdul aziz bin baz dan al allamah muhammad bin shalih al utsaimin
3347061 bagaimanapun semoga allah membalasmu dengan kebaikan saya meminta maaf kepadamu bila saya berbuat salah dan saya mohon ampun kepada allah atas segala kesalahan yang saya perbuat kepada seorang muslim

3347092 everyone is of the mind set we have to drive and parking has always been an issue on campus said mike ogrady director of grounds and fleet operations
3347093 this country is so invested in the automobile and the road were not going to be able to instantly provide transit
3347094 we were the guinea pigs in some ways for a major urban center to consider something like this
3347095 we were really able to put some definition to the project and push it forward
3347096 our system has almost every attribute of rail except rail
3347097 if you operate a system that is perceived to be simple to use has great frequency is safe and is clean you will attract new riders i am confident we will attract new riders
3347098 even if we start small and build a smaller line here in toledo we could see the resulting increases in private development
3347099 it does take a leap of faith but as other cities have demonstrated if you do take that leap with public dollars private dollars will follow
3347100 many systems around the state instead of adding service when demand is at an all time high are probably going to be cutting service
3347101 my diesel bill went from 5 million in 2003 to 12 million last year to 21 million this year and it should be about 24 million next year
3347102 most people in toledo people say under 50 probably have never ridden a bus before or only on sporadic occasion
3347103 the bus system has gotten to be a class system
3347104 middle class people who might use the bus instead of taking a car trip dont do it
3347105 people say with buses theyre good because theyre flexible but they could disappear at any moment
3347106 what makes urban rail work is when you create transit routes that have clusters of neighborhoods on them
3347107 you should design routes based on your existing neighborhoods and tie that into the growth of downtown businesses rather than trying to capture a larger area
3347108 the projects are getting more and more difficult to get funded
3347109 rail is very expensive to build and very expensive to maintain
3347110 lots of people have to want to go from a to b and b to c
3347111 in toledo we quite simply dont have those destination points
3347112 if you look at the intercity rail that has been the most successful its the northeast corridor one reason is you have a lot of people a lot of density
3347113 we dont have the density to make rail be cost effective
3347114 it would be much easier and more convenient to take a train to columbus than driving a personal vehicle
3347115 the maumee river was the i 75 of its day because that connected the great lakes with the rest of the country
3347116 the technology is really simple and the wells and the water and the earth will be there forever
3347117 its a huge resource but its a largely untapped resource
3347118 its like deciding between two cars one that costs 10 000 and one that costs 35 000
3347119 but the 35 000 car comes with a lifetime supply of gas now that energy prices are high people are beginning to think about what they pay for fuel
3347120 im pleased with my time even though a couple of technical things went wrong
3347121 going for air and getting a mouthful of water instead that puts a damper on doing well it was the second breath out of the turn its happened to me before you just learn not to panic that a breath is coming in two more strokes

3347124 the fact that the international stagnation forecast at the beginning of the year is now a reality
3347125 the result demonstrates once again the great strength of our classic product lines and the importance of combining these with new strong licenses
3347126 as the bulk of toy sales are concentrated in the closing months of the year there is still a substantial element of doubt about the overall result for the year
3347127 particularly in view of the continued negative economic development which looks like gaining ground

3347138 if an independent chief minister can rule for over one and a half year then what is the problem if soren gets the chair for the remaining period
3347139 he is one of those leaders who are rooted to the grass root level and has a strong mass base among the tribal community
3347140 by revoking the allotment of land to shri amarnath shrine board the congress has demonstrated that it is one with the fundamentalists in creating a theocratic environment in the kashmir valley
3347141 it is not a hindu muslim issue but it is a fight between tricolour carrying patriots and separatist forces in kashmir
3347142 as a result of the policies of congress since independence the hindu minorities have been thrown out of the valley and temples have been destroyed and desecrated today even the innocuous act of providing land for sheds and toilet facilities for the pilgrims has been withdrawn
3347143 if this game we should lose from the beginning by 10 points then ok
3347144 but now we can win this game and we did not
3347145 we started the game with good discipline good defense i dont know why but in the fourth quarter we made bad decisions before we started for sure we didnt think that we could win but this situation changed and at that point we should win easy
3347146 we had every chance to win and in the last two or three minutes of regulation time i thought we were winning
3347147 but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory
3347148 but this game shows that we do not have the experience like them when they are losing by 10 points they do not get nervous they just get one point one point and play their way back
3347149 maybe in the last minutes we want to win too much we think about this to much we confused ourselves

3347152 such statements by leaders of a foreign country do not help the situation
3347153 these statements constitute clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3347154 creating the atmosphere necessary for the dialogue process between india and pakistan to move forward
3347155 deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in jammu and kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people we call for immediate steps to end the violence against innocent kashmiris
3347156 important that an enabling environment free of violence is created to sustain the peace process and address the long standing dispute of jammu and kashmir
3347157 economic blockade imposed by hindu extremists against the muslims of jammu and the valley of kashmir

3347235 the real issue is including more people in this broad umbrella of a growing flourishing economy
3347236 we need to roll up our sleeves and think about what the economy is going to look like in 20 or 30 years
3347237 a commitment to a certain kind of change a change that takes into account what works best about your society its less religious its also not a backwards looking or a nostalgic conservatism but its how to manage change
3347238 the libertarians ive found persuasive have always had a social conservative bent to them as well
3347239 but i think theres a reason senator ted kennedy considers himself steeped in catholic social doctrine
3347240 the way to restore faith in our government is to slash its flabbiness while making it more effective
3347241 i think that the easy way to read it is that its huckabeeism or a smarter version of huckabeeism
3347242 but actually were trying to draw in a lot of these different strands and change the subject of the debate
3347243 any republican politician worried about his partys eroding base and grim prospects should make a careful study
3347244 the fact that the least conservative least divisive republican in the 2008 race is the last one standing shows how little life is left in the movement that goldwater began nixon brought into power ronald reagan gave mass appeal newt gingrich radicalized tom delay criminalized and bush allowed to break into pieces
3347245 i dont think to speak in terms of obituaries really makes sense
3347246 we started talking about it shortly after the 2004 election when everyone was talking about the permanent republican majority and the vindication of karl rove
3347247 we were sort of looking at data and reading conservative writers and thought the gop was in a lot of trouble
3347248 wants to give you the failed bush health care policies for another four years
3347249 by confusing being pro market with being pro business by failing to distinguish spending that fosters dependency and spending that fosters independence and upward mobility and by shrinking from the admittedly difficult task of reforming the welfare state so that it serves the interest of the working class rather than the affluent
3347250 what reagan did is to apply conservative principles to the problems that faced him at the time
3347251 we dont have a top tax rate of 70 percent so maybe our approach should change as well
3347252 they seek tax reforms that cut taxes on investment returns and thereby increase economic growth what they ignore is that we overtax investments in children too
3347253 their ability to get those things is almost certainly improved if they are tied to a policy that many millions of american families will like

3347261 when you have salespeople who are arbitrarily assigned regions verticals or accounts it dramatically decreases your effectiveness and your sales numbers
3347262 we decided to help organize the sales effort and distribution of leads and resources more efficiently so once training ended there was a next stepping stone towards bigger profits

3347278 if you take 2000 in sydney our mens four were fourth in their last race in lucerne and just before athens in the same regatta they were third
3347279 it might look a bit glossier looking back than it does in reality
3347280 matthew had said that he had never won at lucerne which is always the last world cup in an olympic year there is a bit of context to our crews not always getting the last race right before they come here
3347281 they are going well all respect to the people we are racing australia and new zealand i am sure will be very strong we will be there
3347282 i thought i would just feel relieved at qualifying but i am pleased too
3347283 we hoped the australians had gone out too early and we tried to keep calm and in the end we were right
3347284 the race went out really hard and now i feel like i have given everything
3347285 but you bounce back pretty quickly we can pace it the semi final a bit better and give ourselves a chance of a sprint at the end

3347290 in this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the atc controller who on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent quickly switched to texting his instructions instead
3347291 this contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and for such the controller should be commended for his actions
3347292 they taxied us out and weve been sitting on the tarmac ever since
3347293 they start the engines they move us and then they kill them
3347294 they didnt let us get up to use the bathrooms till after 11
3347295 we could be sitting here for five more hours who knows
3347296 it was only about an hour and a half flight to pensacola so everybody thought oh well no problem

3347320 it was necessary to have this type of discussion if we want to reach this objective or not and if so lets see what we have to do looks like this objective lacked us getting rid of this thing that i myself consider relatively humiliating but the fact that it exists being liked by the romanian part a monitoring process gives the right of any eu entity to leave comments that we do not like appreciation that we do not like to any institution
3347321 if the option of the parties is to keep under monitoring during a period bigger than 12 months we must know exactly how we stand
3347322 while supporters like you are out knocking on doors registering new voters and organizing in your local communities our opponents are not even trying to match your efforts instead theyre spending millions to spread the smear that barack is just a celebrity and that our grassroots movement is just a bunch of mindless fans

3347376 i wouldnt be nearly as successful without the solid team that i have working with me
3347377 i can see myself having five teams and earning at least six figures a month its a very realistic goal when i first joined trivita i knew that this opportunity would change our family forever not that my entire family is benefitting from trivita im filled with gratitude and great hopes for the future

3347412 dear brothers and sisters if another believer is overcome by some sin you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path and be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself share each others burdens and in this way obey the law of christ if you think you are too important to help someone you are only fooling yourself you are not that important
3347413 spouting off before listening to the facts is both shameful and foolish
3347414 claim to be religious but dont control our tongue we are only fooling yourself and our religion is worthless
3347415 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted by god
3347416 lord where are you why havent you rushed in to protect me why havent you put up a wall around me to keep this evil from invading my life dont you care that i might sin do you want me to sin
3347417 then jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil
3347418 god blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation afterward they will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him
3347419 for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men
3347420 if anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue he deceives himself and his religion is worthless
3347421 is our religion pure and genuine in the sight of god the father
3347422 ik durf niet straks is ie eigenlijk helemaal niet leuk en aardig en valt ie van zijn voetstuk ik kan niet interviewen wat nou als ik een black out krijg wat moet ik eigenlijk vragen misschien val ik wel flauw niet voorbij laten gaan en dus wandel ik de zonnige zondagmiddag v r zijn concert in paradiso schijnbaar cool en vrijwel zonder te trillen hotel americain binnen om er achter te komen dat held folds eerst nog even wat is gaan eten oh een ietwat vaag trio dat een podcast interview komt doen en nogal haast lijkt te hebben om ook nog naar een ander interview te rennen laat ik ook maar even voor want stel je voor dat hun haastklusje mij zou opjagen dat gaat allemaal van mijn valuable ben tijd af zeker een uur later mag ik dan eindelijk op audi ntie ik schud zijn hand en ga tegenover hem zitten hij wrijft even over zijn rug rekt zich uit en kijkt mij vervolgens verwachtingsvol aan klaar voor een serieus interview weet hij veel dat ie stiekem gewooon een fan tegenover zich heeft zitten ik adem nog maar eens diep in en zet de voicerecorder aan oh nee ik zet mijn voicerecorder dus helemaal niet aan suffe fan die ik ben dat vergeet ik gewoon ik stel alleen maar de eerste vraag en hang aan zijn lippen rockin park gisteren
3347423 dat was best leuk alleen ben ik op een gegeven moment door mn rug gegaan geloof ik ken je dat dat je ineens nogal hard knak hoort en meteen denkt dit is niet goed ik heb gewoon doorgespeeld maar na het optreden moest ik wel even plat op mn rug gaan liggen ik heb wel wat van live gehoord en iets dat enuk heet klonk wel aardig maar ik heb geen idee hoe ze eruit zien dus
3347424 volgens mij heb ik met ben folds five ook wel eens in paradiso gespeeld ik verheug me erop als mn rug een beetje meewerkt tenminste het optreden in paradiso was voor ons de beste van de vorige europese tour het is een te gekke zaal goeie sfeer was het vroeger niet een kerk ofzo
3347425 yep we noemen het zelfs een poptempel is er zoveel verschil tussen de zalen waar je speelt
3347426 in duitsland was vorige keer ook wel ok maar toen hadden we allemaal een soort van halve longontsteking en zaten we onder de medicijnen dat is niet echt lekker spelen oh shit ik lijk wel een zeurende ouwe lul net met die rug en nu weer over verkouden maar goed dat heb je soms ik heb er wel zin in vanavond en dat terwijl ik in het vliegtuig nog niet eens wist dat we hier zouden zouden spelen vorig jaar trouwens ook trouwens niet ik dacht dat het alleen een uk tour zou worden dus ik was best aangenaam verrast toen ik amsterdam op de tourlijst zag staan
3347427 is in paradiso spelen leuker dan een festival ik kan me voorstellen dat je liever in een kleinere zaal speelt
3347428 in amerika spelen we in heel grote zalen soms wel 50 000 man ook op festivals trouwens je hebt dan wel minder contact met het publiek in europa moet je op zon festival wel harder je best doen want mensen komen sowieso niet speciaal voor jou we zijn hier niet zo bekend en mensen hebben nou eenmaal de neiging om eerder naar iets te gaan kijken waarvan ze weten wat ze krijgen maar dan is het extra cool als je ziet dat blijven staan en daardoor de grote namen overslaan
3347429 ik snap eigenlijk sowieso niet zo goed waarom je hier in nederland niet heel erg bekend bent en weinig airplay krijgt zo ontoegankelijk is je muziek niet heb je daar zelf een idee over
3347430 ik denk niet dat het te maken heeft met het soort muziek dat ik maak ik bedoel je kan het niet echt freaky muziek noemen toch hoewel als je ziet dat mensen massaal naar die enuk gaan kijken dan snap ik weer wel waarom ze niet naar mijn muziek luisteren het wijkt waarschijnlijk net teveel af van mainstream en soms moet je er zlefs even over nadenken haha waarschijnlijk heeft het vooral te maken met de keus die ik zelf heb gemaakt om veel in amerika te spelen daar word ik veel gevraagd spelen we in heel grote zalen net als in australi en sommige plaatsen in azi in europa zou ik heel erg veel tijd hebben moeten stoppen promoties touren in kleinere zalen en waarom zou ik dat doen als ik dichterbij huis meer mensen kan bereiken en ook veel meer geld kan verdienen het komt er eigenlijk gewoon op neer dat ik de afgelopen jaren geen tijd heb gehad om europa ook nog in het schema te proppen
3347431 gelukkig heb je ondertussen wel tijd gehad om een nieuwe plaat te maken
3347432 ja die komt half september uit ik ben er heel erg blij mee
3347433 nou nee ik heb ook wel eens een plaat gemaakt met ben folds five waar ik maar gedeeltelijk tevreden over was en al tijdens de promotie dacht fuck ik heb helemaal geen zin om te vertellen hoe fantastisch dit album is en dan moet ik ook nog al die nummers gaan spelen maar bij deze nieuwe plaat heb ik zin in om alles te spelen het is een behoorlijk harde plaat geworden full on zeg maar in your face meer rock achtig dan wat ik hiervoor heb gedaan er staan ook maar twee rustige nummers op meer in de stijl van de de begintijd van ben folds five zou je kunnen zeggen
3347434 in het verleden heb je ook veel covers gespeeld kunnen we dat ook verwachten op deze plaat
3347435 nee daar ben ik wel weer even mee klaar het zijn allemaal mijn eigen nummers ik had ook meer dan genoeg materiaal om een hele plaat te vullen dus waarom zou ik dan andermans nummers gebruiken
3347436 wist je trouwens dat er ook een nederlandse band is die een nummer van jou heeft gecoverd in het nederlands
3347437 wat nee geen idee van kan me niet voorstellen hoe dat klinkt
3347438 ik heb het op mn ipod wil je het horen
3347439 je hoeft niet het hele nummer af te luisteren als je dat niet wil
3347440 that was totally weird but cool ik herken het bijna niet meer terug en dan die kan ik het ergens kopen op het internet ik moet dit aan mn bassist laten horen ik betwijfel of hij het herkent wat grappig en ik weet nu hoe kiss my ass in het nederlands klinkt ook handig
3347441 deze band is eigenlijk een samenwerkingsproject van twee nederlandse bands je hebt zelf getoerd met ben lee amp ben kweller als de bens met tori amos in lottapianos je werkte intensief samen met william shatner en dan die muziekcruise in florida met onder andere clem snide ga je aan meer van dat soort projecten werken in de toekomst
3347442 nou die cruise is nooit doorgegaan eigenlijk die werd geproduceerd door een bedrijf dat die cruises ook met andere muzikanten organiseert maar al snel bleek dat veel van mijn fans student zijn en jonge mensen hebben nou eenmaal niet zoveel geld er kwamen bij de organisatie meer e mails binnen met de vraag of ik niet in buurt zus en zo speelde dan aanmeldingen voor die cruise dus toen hebben ze het maar afgeblazen maakt ook niet uit ik hou niet eens echt van boten en varen ik ben de afgelopen maanden wel bezig geweest met het produceren van het nieuwe album van amanda palmer van de dresden dolls waarop ik ook heb meegespeeld is erg goed geworden die plaat komt ongeveer tegelijk met mijn nieuwe plaat uit wat dan misschien weer niet zo handig is om te vertellen competition you know
3347443 nou ik weet wel zon beetje alles wat ik weten wilde ik heb nog een laatste vraag eigenlijk ehm mag ik een fan foto
3347444 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may
3347445 losing the private bank would leave the rump ubs with much more volatile earnings
3347446 but the value of a unit managing more than 1 6 trillion is mind boggling
3347447 a bit like neuberger berman at lehman brothers the buy side is worth such an enormous percentage of the whole that at some point it becomes impossible for a fiduciary not to sell or at the very least spin it off
3347448 weve been invited to a beach tournament but we have to watch the actual invitation on a web site
3347449 you have a giant image of sex on your computer because it reminds you of your world religion class back in college and not because it has a full color image of a woman who looks lot like you getting fucked by some muscular guy in a toga
3347450 you think it looks like me really i was thinking of letting my hair grow out
3347451 i dont even want to know what your opinion is of the flying snake and those twin girls
3347452 they never work and if there is any good porn you cant save it off the flash program
3347453 you do know you can do things with your computer other than porn
3347454 who gave me the link for that beach sex movie
3347455 and who gave me that dvd of anime volleyball porn
3347456 what were you exposing me to when you sent me that picture of that machine that spanks people
3347457 my name is dr otto von madd you might be familiar with some of the sexual aids and entertainments created by my company von madd laboratories for example we make a fine line of voice activated vibrators and this past year we have released our third machine designed to aid in spanking people who lack a spanking partner
3347458 hey he made that machine you sent me a picture of
3347459 yeah it was a weird web site supposedly you could buy lipstick that can give other people an orgasm just by kissing i thought it was a joke because all the prices were so obscenely high i mean two thousand dollars for lipstick
3347460 you could easily earn that money back by opening a kissing booth
3347461 that means you have been chosen from literally thousands of players to participate in the first annual von madd beach volleyball tournament you are invited to spend a glorious four day weekend at my private island where you will stay in luxury class accommodations your air fare will be paid for and you every whim catered to as you stay as my honored guests this tournament will cost you nothing yet the grand prize for winning the tournament is ten million dollars
3347462 as a courtesy gift for listening to my offer so far
3347463 you might be wondering why a sexual genius like myself has invited the best players in the world to a beach volleyball tournament the answer is rather selfish i love beach volleyball and i cant get enough of it however i get bored with the dull way everyone else seems to play it i have my own ideas on how to improve the sport and i am inviting you to help me realize these grand designs
3347464 i would love to share my plans with you now but i am afraid that my competitors in the sexual entertainment fields will steal my ideas my ideas are radical and highly erotic possible variations may include but are not limited to vibrating sports bras weather controlled rainstorms alcoholic penalties aphrodisiac balls stripping courtside massages handstands mud spankings eighteen point matches transparent sports bras and double elimination floggings
3347465 rest assured though that i am not inviting you to my island for sex you can have sex with anyone you like but at no point will you be required to have sex to participate in the tournament all participation will be consensual and you will be provided with a plane trip away from my island at any time that you request one
3347466 with that out of the way lets have another free orgasm as my gift to you
3347467 i was just wondering if well be able to replay the video
3347468 in return for participating in my tournament everyone will receive a free sexual aid of your choice for those who make it all the way to the quarter finals i will give a million dollars to each player for making it to the semi finals i will give two million dollars for making it to the finals i will give five million to the losers and ten million dollars to each member of the winning team
3347469 a team of lawyers will fax you the appropriate accreditation as soon as we receive your application money is meaningless to me i have all that i need for my research this volleyball tournament is my recreation and i want to ensure that the bravest players in the world are well rewarded for their efforts
3347470 do you want to spend four day on a beautiful island are you brave enough to compete in beach volleyball matches that have been erotically improved do you like winning millions of dollars for doing what you love to do anyway all you have to do is fill out the online application now
3347471 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears

3347475 the guard is treated like a step child when they fight abroad and when they return
3347476 it is unacceptable that returning members of the guard and reserve dont receive the same care as returning active duty soldiers even though we are asking them to make the same sacrifices
3347477 i finished my season at lenoir and attended the state games for the underclassmen in north carolina with my little brother

3347479 that is the kind of ballplayer that i am said the outfielder i was kind of playing out of position the past season i was batting in the middle of the lineup for the necessity of the team i had a real good season this past year with the bat i improved my runs batted in last season while batting third about 75 percent of the time during the season
3347480 i am going to do whatever to fight for a spot
3347481 i dont care it they dh me put me in left field send me out at shortstop or catcher i will do whatever it takes to get into the lineup
3347482 i purpose to take occasion of praying upon the sight of any church which i may pass that god may be worshipped there in spirit and that souls may be saved there to pray daily for my sick patients and the patients of other physicians at my entrance into any home to say

3347490 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3347491 but as we have pointed out before those qv statistics are based on property settlements whereas ours are based on unconditional contracts so inevitably the earlier statistics relate to june sales reported in july
3347492 as for the long term prognosis there are plenty of people taking about a 10 per cent decline in values but based on todays figures a decline of that magnitude is not evident yet
3347493 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought
3347494 northlands median price was back up after a big fall in june to 302 750 at 315 00 for july while waikato and the bay of plenty was up from 316 000 in june to 325 000 in july
3347495 hawkes bay provided particularly strong evidence of its recovery with an increase in the median price for the district from 216 000 to 282 000 while manawatu and wanganui were up from 213 750 to 233 750
3347496 taranaki was up from 255 000 to 265 000 and wellington was up from 366 500 in june to 371 000 in july
3347497 nelson and marlborough were again a little weaker with a median down from 335 000 in june to 330 000 but canterbury and westland recovered slightly from 299 000 to 300 000
3347498 central otago lakes district was up from 514 000 to 565 000 but on low sales while otago rallied from 225 000 in june to 240 000 in july

3347511 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for

3347630 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3347631 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3347632 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3347633 some people think im too old but that just means i have nothing to lose china has developed so fast i wanted to come back and say how thankful i was for everything

3347635 it applies to so many endeavours in life to include our sport of show jumping you better be willing to evolve
3347636 in october we had some friends staying and over a few too many glasses of wine i said something like find me a horse for the next olympics

3347643 the ti nspire graphing calculator has proven its value in my classes
3347644 thats the first time ive written a song like that from the point of view of the hopeless romantic
3347645 i think the words resonate with people who find something in their own life that relates to it
3347646 my last album chemical sunsets had a fairly busy rock sound and the new one is stripped right back and that really seems to connect with people maybe its because they can hear the lyrics

3347655 those changes will be made by 2010 and if it happens mexico will have to work hard to have a proper track even so we must wait for bernie ecclestones decision to include mexico
3347656 we are able to do it because the authorities are willing to make the relevant investments and everyone has a chance we just have to afford it since a formula one track is worth more than 50 million
3347657 on a street circuit the problem is that theres no grip in the beginning
3347658 on a normal track you learn it in ten laps but it will take more than that maybe 20 to get the hang of valencia
3347659 well really be taking a guess on the set up from what we know of other street tracks and then take it step by step through the weekend so its very important to keep the car on the track because if you crash you lose a lot of time that the others will spend working on it
3347660 all the teams are starting at zero so it will be a big challenge for everyone to get the best out of it as quickly as possible in the limited time we have
3347661 its not like a normal street track it seems wide like an american type of street circuit
3347662 we tested our new seamless shift gearbox and we are very happy with the results
3347663 there are some pikeys out there putting some new tarmac down at turn 10 apparently are they out of the way yet
3347664 they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshops
3347665 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them
3347666 we will have to accommodate that by rotating people they will not be expected to go right through the season
3347667 force india have clearly demonstrated that we have caught up and improved one realises how tough formula one really is and it reinforces the challenge that i have before me for 2009 to be really competitive
3347668 im not only catching up from last season but from the last three seasons and we have caught up even though f1 has become so competitive which is good
3347669 i am quite optimistic however that my experience so far has pointed us in the right direction i now know precisely what im up against so i can plan better
3347670 maybe i learned the hard way but its good to learn so 2009 will be much more competitive for the force india team
3347671 i have two good drivers the experience of giancarlo is invaluable and adrian has lots of talent i think he is improving race by race becoming more consistent
3347672 i am quite happy with them and more importantly they have a great attitude that will help me to face the challenges of tomorrow

3347674 there is nothing concrete yet i am speaking with some teams
3347675 i dont really want to answer that at the moment
3347676 we have other things to worry about and we need to get back in the right direction
3347677 we can definitely do better than where we are now particularly with the rule changes its a big opportunity to put a good car out there

3347685 do not be fooled when the administration claims it is merely tweaking the law

3347695 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3347701 our guys have certain things that they each do well but we may not have the one guy who can do it all
3347702 kevin boss is going to be a good receiver hes going to make a lot of catches i think he is going to be the first one to tell you that he needs to continue to work on his blocking
3347703 when they come out of the game they get excited they started talking to me about where these defenders are and we look at the tape and it wasnt that way at all
3347704 a lot of times youre trying to figure out whats going on in the secondary how theyre rotating the safeties and where the blitz is coming from sometimes there is confusion
3347705 we had a couple of bad things happen on the edge of the defense really that halted our drives because they were both critical situations in the game
3347706 with the youth at tackle when the younger players go in there were just all holding on and hoping they can recall what weve done
3347707 i would like to win the champions league with inter and play for la nazionale
3347708 i dont think that italy will overlook the younger players when there is quality however you never know its up to the coach in the end
3347709 in amsterdam arsenal seemed like a rag doll in our hands at times during the game
3347710 some of the ajax directors said to me that we played like we were the harlem globetrotters of football
3347711 of course it will not be until we are in santander that we know what level we are truly at
3347712 we didnt win the title we were very close but in the end we lost and the champions league final everybody was disappointed about this
3347713 but we have to look forward to the next season we have a good squad and another chance to win four titles
3347714 i am happy and i am prepared for this season now everything is fine and i am looking forward to playing next season
3347715 in germany we always said the biggest thing to win is the league title because it is a competition for the whole season so we are looking for this title and also the champions league
3347716 we have a big squad and a strong squad in midfield but it is a big competition we have a big target to win not just one title but go for all four so we need a big squad
3347717 it shows that chelsea has a very good team and is very organised and competitive
3347718 arsenal are one of the strongest teams we could have met
3347719 but for our young team it will be something special the young players can get a lot of experience in these big matches not only now but with one eye on the future
3347720 in the two matches against arsenal we are not just the underdogs but we are very big underdogs
3347721 nobody will expect fc twente to beat arsenal we have nothing to lose
3347722 i am really impressed by the organisation of fc twente
3347723 i see people who are working for the club with passion and want to go further
3347724 on the pitch i found a group with a very good fitness level so we could immediately work on the performance
3347725 looking back to last season when they finished fourth for the second campaign running is useless that was the first thing i made clear to the squad you cannot live on the success you had before
3347726 we want to go on down the line that brought success before and that is what we are working on now
3347727 at the draw it soon became clear we would get a strong opponent and arsenal is certainly that
3347728 they are one of europes best and they will be two very difficult matches for us
3347729 of course we are the underdogs but in football anything is possible
3347730 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue
3347731 i was able to get a sense of his soul

3347744 se qualcuno ama un fiore di cui esiste un solo esemplare in milioni e milioni di stelle questo basta a farlo felice quando lo guarda e non e importante questo
3347745 non bisogna mai ascoltare i fiori basta guardarli e respirarli il mio profumava il mio pianeta ma non sapevo rallegrarmene quella storia degli artigli che mi aveva tanto raggelato avrebbe dovuto intenerirmi
3347746 non ho saputo capire niente allora avrei dovuto giudicarlo dagli atti non dalle parole mi profumava e mi illuminava
3347747 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cosi importante
3347748 e il tempo che ho perduto per la mia rosa
3347749 gli uomini hanno dimenticato questa verita ma tu non la devi dimenticare tu diventi responsabile per sempre di quello che hai addomesticato tu sei responsabile della tua rosa
3347750 ecco cio che mi commuove di piu di questo piccolo principe addormentato e la sua fedelta a un fiore e limmagine di una rosa che risplende in lui come la fiamma di una lampada anche quando dorme
3347751 e come per il fiore se tu vuoi bene a un fiore che sta in una stella e dolce la notte guardare il cielo tutte le stelle sono fiorite
3347752 sai il mio fiore ne sono responsabile ed e talmente debole e talmente ingenuo ha quattro spine da niente per proteggermi dal mondo
3347753 i think that our school has too much technology in some areas and not enough in other areas we have to much technology in everyday classes that dont need technology we dont need technology in every class we could use the technology in computer classes but not classes like english and religion as to not having enough technology in computer classes the computers are very basic and we could use technology in maths and science at our school we spend money on technology for all classes but i think it could be better spent for modern computers and science equipment during classes like english i think we should spend more time with hand writing because during exams and tests you dont have a computer to check spelling grammar information and ideas it would help our writing abilities if we spent more time hand writing instead of using computers for everything
3347754 everybody in todays century is way too reliant on technology i mean even now we have to express our opinions online just to be heard properly when we can easily say it during class while saving electricity sure technology has its good side its entertaining and easy to use but the old ways of teaching a class got you to be more social and friendly towards others and made you speak up and express your opinion strongly

3347756 we have been waiting for this moment for years and we are all excited we all know what we are going to be up against a very difficult team what we have seen and what we have heard tells us they are really hard to beat on their home ground and that they like to attack
3347757 its a hammer blow the most difficult opponents for us but im sure that madrid would also have wished for a different opponent we want to get through this tie at any cost and make it to the group stage so well have to beat these opponents i dont see a favourite so the chances of getting through are 50 50
3347758 i can assure everyone villa and silva will stay next season with valencia

3347778 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety

3347781 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3347782 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3347783 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3347784 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3347785 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married
3347786 we studied one of the systems that remove damaged proteins
3347787 the liver cells were able to maintain the same level of activity as when they were young
3347788 as we understand why this system decreases with aging we are trying to identify compounds that do the same thing
3347789 also we are looking at dietary manipulation some modifications in the diet might do the same thing
3347790 another piece of evidence supporting the contention that aging is a reversible condition we can not only slow aging but also reverse many forms of aging

3348206 our lto 2 tape library was growing out of control with two libraries handling 1500 tape slots and 16 tape drives and still we needed more capacity
3348207 our choice was either to move to disk or buy a second tape library
3348208 we knew we needed a vtl to correct our performance and scalability issues
3348209 sepaton bested the competition on performance and scalability hands down
3348210 during the testing phase our backup administrator was amazed to see that the backups happened so fast we couldnt see it we dramatically increased the size of the data set and it became barely visible its still very fast
3348211 retrieving even a couple of files from different points in time meant mounting and culling through tens to hundreds of tapes with sepaton you simply go to the appropriate point in time the system makes restoring data nearly immediate and relieves our it staff of time consuming media management tasks and frees them up for more productive assignments
3348212 sepaton was selected to fulfill our vision for a tapeless data protection strategy
3348213 their compatibility with physical tape systems means we can benefit from a combined disk tape strategy in the interim and give us the confidence that we have the systems in place to evolve our strategy overtime
3348214 seamlessly scaling performance and scalability independently from a single sepaton vtl is a capability unmatched in the industry
3348215 while us oncology had the foresight to outline a data protection and risk management strategy that may require some changes in their dr procedures they prudently selected a backup and recovery system that can straddle the realities of where they are today but will not require any policy changes or costly upgrades when they implement their future vision

3348399 the discipline which makes the colleagues of a strong organization effective in operations is not to be gained by harsh or tyrannical treatment on the contrary such treatment is far more likely to destroy than to make a strong organization it is possible to impart guidance and to give directions in such a manner and such a tone of voice to inspire in a colleague the feeling of an intense desire to obey while the opposite manner and tone of voice cannot fail to excite strong resentments and a desire to disobey the one mode or other of dealing with colleagues springs from the corresponding spirit in the breast of the leader he who feels the respect which is due to others cannot fail to inspire in them regard for himself while he who feels and hence manifests disrespect towards others especially his subordinates cannot fail to inspire hatred against himself

3348440 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3348441 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3348442 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3348448 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3348449 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3348450 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3348451 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3348452 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3348470 mitsubishi fuso offers the fuso canter eco hybrid in japan since 2006 and hits the growing interest of costumers in europe
3348471 however for many customers the relatively high cost of a hybrid is an obstacle to actually purchasing one together with its partners daimler is investing in this pilot project in order to find out how economical the hybrid is for customers in comparison with conventional drive systems and to optimize product development with regard to customers requirements
3348472 if we want to fix this in something less than a three year time horizon which i hope we want to do it has to be done in the very near term

3348501 with a little dns spoofing i fed my own list into the iphone and effectively killed by name applications that attempt to use the gps it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporize switch
3348502 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporize any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software
3348503 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together
3348504 you should never have been in that situation to begin with and again brings up the question is the iphone really an enterprise device
3348505 on the other hand how did the i am rich app get through
3348506 weve been on a global mandate to try to be the best in that particular area
3348507 if you look at for example the certification youll see that dell has one of the most certifications of any vendor out there were absolutely paying attention to making sure our systems are not just environmentally sound but each product that we deliver has to have a significant environmental lead over its predecessor
3348508 we pushed our refresh mode some of our equipment was five to six years old and it was at that point that we decided to go out to rfp
3348509 we needed equipment that we felt would meet the demand and needs of our students and our staff
3348510 we wanted to provide leading edge equipment but equipment that was proven had a track record and more importantly a company that had a track record and stood behind their product
3348511 we are a self maintainer so it was important for us that when we went to a new vendor that we understood the type of equipment we were getting and the type of partnership we were entering into
3348512 when you think about the service time in a large organization such as st lawrence downtime is just unacceptable
3348513 the ability for them to bypass our help desk altogether and just tap into our supply chain and dispatch parts and or parts and technicians immediately really does help
3348514 we need to do most of our work in about seven or eight weeks in the summer once school starts in september you cant be messing around and taking labs out of service replacing equipment its important the students have access to that
3348515 ive worked both the private and public sector and there are challenges to both when you are doing a complete refresh but one of the challenges colleges face is the timing
3348516 you have to make sure that the equipment is up and running and available for these students all the time a lot of our labs theyre 24 hours so theres very little downtime for us and a very short window for us to get this implemented
3348517 we had one customer tell us that on one evening someone went into the college and stole all their plasma displays another particular customer said all their notebooks got stolen 20 some odd notebooks overnight its always a struggle in higher ed to secure assets
3348518 thats something i think that the more a vendor like dell can bring to the table where we have integrated security features built into a lot of our technologies that the college can tap into
3348519 our students demand the best and they demand reliability and they really test this equipment out our students come from an age now where theyve pretty much grown up with computers all their lives they know whats good and they know what works and what doesnt so it was very important to us that we have a very reputable vendor that had a proven track record within this environment
3348520 i think the other thing that is unique is the institution really has a number of end users that the it department serves they have the faculty and staff and they also have the students each one of those requirements needs to be easily addressable
3348521 another thing that colleges and universities really appreciate are long stable managed lifecycles
3348522 thats something weve been fine tuning for many years now they dont like disruption to their technology and so weve provided them with very energy efficient yet stable dell portfolio of standards with very very long lifecycles as well

3348618 we work with companies such as proxim wireless and smartway digital to ensure that we continue to deliver state of the art multimedia solutions to our audience and provide superior real time information broadcasting
3348619 this deployment was especially challenging because we needed to integrate different kinds of wireless networks as well as av compression with wimax
3348620 proxims end to end wireless product portfolio is ideal for such a deployment since the equipment provides end to end qos which is critical for voice and video and enables us to customize a network to meet the precise wireless needs of our customers with the confidence that the equipment will interact well throughout the network
3348621 proxim has a long history as an innovator in the wireless broadband market and was an early proponent of wimax technology this deployment illustrates the benefits of proxims end to end solution by providing a more cost effective and higher capacity solution than the previous satellite based system enabling the delivery of wireless iptv to more people
3348622 taiwan is a key growth area for us offering significant market opportunities for wimax as well as other technologies in our broadband wireless product portfolio

3348628 we are very pleased with the june quarterly results of both business segments and the resulting 42 increase in overall revenue and almost tripling of income from continuing operations after taxes to 632 000 we believe the tripling of income from continuing operations over 2007s third quarter reaffirms the success of our turnaround tire recycling revenue was up over 25 compared to a year ago due to a 25 increase in overall tire derived end product revenues and a 15 increase in scrap tire volumes our recently acquired molded recycled rubber products business segment enjoyed a 46 increase in revenue for the june quarter compared to the march quarter and as of the nine months ended june 30 2008 have surpassed their total revenue for the pro forma previous fiscal year we are well positioned to take advantage of continued strong demand for our end products as we enter the seasonally strong fourth quarter
3348629 our focus during the past two years on quality of revenue earnings and cash flow has created significant internal value that is not easily recognized due to the historical debt on our balance sheet the good news is that this phenomenal turnaround of the income statement will allow greenman to be in a better position to address our remaining balance sheet issues in the upcoming quarters

3348673 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3348674 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3348675 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3348676 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3348677 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3348678 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3348679 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3348680 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3348681 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3348682 we are not staying home with our children by default
3348683 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3348684 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3348685 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3348686 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3348687 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3348688 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3348689 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3348690 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
3348691 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals

3348698 islam will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
3348699 dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise
3348700 the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
3348701 in other words that piece of legislation would overturn any laws that any state legislature has passed for example prohibiting taxpayer funding of abortion allowing parents a right to know when their teenage daughters are considering having an abortion a right to know or informed consent or any other common sense limits like partial abortion bans that weve put on the books that would overturn all of those laws
3348702 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
3348703 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
3348704 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion

3348707 its critically important for us as a city to think a little bit differently than we have in the past
3348708 we dont actually have anything that were delivering at this particular moment what we are pledging is to work toward the development of a series of initiatives
3348709 this is a long term project thats going to continue and its actually going to take years and years of work
3348710 well get some sort of recognition for the work that weve done but it will also help us lay out a road map for what we need to do to be a more friendly city for cyclists and pedestrians
3348711 thats one third too few and we continue to work toward 100 percent accessibility

3348717 we think that mexicans and other immigrants should be warned if they cross into the u s they are putting their health at risk by leaving behind a healthier staple diet of corn tortillas beans rice fruits and vegetables

3348719 our fear and concern are well founded when one considers the fact that some of our respected colleagues in the law profession whose primary concern should be the discharge of the paramount duty they owe to the institution and administration of justice are seen in the forefront of this inglorious and unprofessional conduct
3348720 the judges are not saints but ordinary mortals they are susceptible to errors in their judgments pronouncements and conduct
3348721 we posit however that the pages of newspapers do not provide an apt forum as approved in civilised democracy to eulogise or condemn judges for decisions taken in the performance of their lawful duties when the court of appeal and the national judicial council are in place to take care of perverse judgments and complaints against the integrity of judges
3348722 as an apolitical body of professionals we in the discharge of our duty to the institution and administration of justice call for a truce to this long drawn war of attrition between the stakeholders
3348723 we also recommend that the disciplinary committee of the nba descends heavily on our recalcitrant colleagues who will want to continue with this grossly unprofessional act out of unwholesome desire to retain offices in government or satisfy the morbid whims and caprices of their clients
3348724 this is a very important phase for nimrodel as we utilise our extensive geophysical database to put in place a substantial diamond drilling campaign

3348731 there will be no joyriders as everyone who is travelling has a role to play in beijing the alternate runners will come in handy as perfect replacements should there be injuries in the team
3348732 for a very long time sportsmen and women who have brought glory to this country have been receiving no recognition from the government for their gallant efforts until recently

3348748 under the circumstances i believe that this adjustment while well intentioned is unaffordable to the commonwealths retirement system
3348749 i was very much in favor of limiting it to 40 000 and under because those are the people youre trying to help
3348750 i am disappointed frustrated and angered by the governors action

3349021 i first fled to the democratic republic of congo in 1972 with my parents when the war broke out in congo i fled again in 1998 to tanzania but by then i was alone my husband and three children had been killed i am still alone here
3349022 i returned to burundi for the first time on 17 november 2006
3349023 at least here at this site my neighbours can attend to me and bring me some comfort whenever i am ill we live under similar conditions and this makes relationships stronger
3349024 while in tanzania we were told they the government could help us to build houses
3349025 nobody can be pleased to live in a makeshift camp only refugees live there otherwise it will be leaving one camp for another
3349026 what were being offered is just like pocket money and yet the government is supposed to accept responsibility for what befell us
3349027 it may be inappropriate to put it in this way but the atomic bombs and the soviet entry into the war are in a sense gods gifts
3349028 now we can end the war without making it clear that we have to end the war because of the domestic situation
3349029 i have long been advocating the conclusion of the war not because i am afraid of the enemys attacks or because of the atomic bombs or the soviet participation in the war
3349030 the most important reason is my concern over the domestic situation

3349070 check the time stamps and come to the same conclusion as i did
3349071 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
3349072 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
3349073 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
3349074 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
3349075 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
3349076 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
3349077 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in
3349078 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
3349079 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem

3349235 i regret that some of our partners are not helping us but in fact are trying to impede us
3349236 i am referring to the us transfer aboard its military transport planes and directly into the conflict zone of the georgian military contingent from iraq
3349237 it seems that this will not change anything but will move us away from resolving the situation
3349238 what is striking is not the cynicism of the politicians politicians are as a rule cynical but the scale of their cynicism the ability to present black as white the ability to present the aggressor as the victim and the victim as the aggressor and to put responsibility on the victims of course needed to be hanged for destroying several shiite villages but not the current georgian leadership which in less than an hour drove tanks through children and old people burned people alive in their homes these leaders need to be protected
3349239 russia will bring its peacekeeping mission to its logical conclusion

3349242 the latest developments such as the crossing of the georgian borders by russian troops change the dimension of the conflict
3349243 we therefore call upon russia to stop immediately all military activity on georgian territory

3349293 he chooses not to take a long view in solving the companys problems but is slashing and burning to get to a position where he can focus on rebuilding the business model in the process his credibility has been shot
3349294 the first priority of risk has been to make sure that our legacy portfolio of assets in the sub prime and mortgage areas are separated and managed to be optimized and we have done that we have also made sure they are well capitalized

3349297 is attempting to solve the companys problems business by business this is what made jpmorgan chases jamie dimon a success

3349324 i am pleased that debbie coyle has been nominated to stand for sinn f in in this by election and the opportunity to increase our representation on fermanagh district council and in enniskillen

3349326 i believe that we have a real opportunity to win this seat and we will by putting the resources in place to take this council seat
3349327 this is a time of huge change in the political landscape across ireland in the north new political realities and working institutions provide new challenges and opportunities while unionism has yet to grasp how fundamentally things have changed there is no going back the only way is forward
3349328 we have regrouped and focused ourselves on rebuilding the party bringing in new members developing our activism and crucially on connecting with the communities we seek to represent
3349329 i believe that here in fermanagh that the party is well placed to build upon solid foundations
3349330 this is an important election for sinn fein not just because it is part of our fight back it is an important election for sinn fein because for too long the people of fermanagh have been denied the type of representation they deserve
3349331 it is with great honour and pride that i accept the nomination to fight this by election for sinn fein in enniskillen
3349332 i follow a long line of people who have sought a mandate from the people on behalf of sinn fein a mandate for change a mandate for irish national self determination and unity and a mandate for equality
3349333 those who know me will know that i first moved to enniskillen at a time of great personnel distress that i have made my life in enniskillen with my young family and how greatly value what enniskillen has given to me
3349334 the party here locally has faced many challenges in recent times i am part of the team here in enniskillen that is not deflected or distracted
3349335 i continue to work for local people to listen to local people and to try and help and support people who not get the assistance for elsewhere
3349336 i am proud to be part of that hard working team and proud to be part of the sinn fein fight back here in enniskillen and across fermanagh

3349338 from some long forgotten source i heard that june beetles made a sweet sound while flying around i loved music and the method to acquire this living music box was to fasten a long thread to one of the bugs hind legs
3349339 now june beetles are about half an inch across and three quarters of an inch long the ones in the south are dark green on the back side and have an armor like covering over their undersides they feed on fennel and are harmless
3349340 one day i chased down a june beetle and brought it in
3349341 the ground around the house was level so i chose a spot where i could turn my bug loose
3349342 i felt bad over my loss and set about repairing it i found another june beetle but somehow i didnt like this one quite as well as the first one just the same i hurried into the house to have mother tie a thread on its leg this time mother openly expressed her dislike for such activities nevertheless with strong urging on my part she tied the thread once again i took the new june beetle outside and let it fly as i had the old one but the knot in the thread was too loose and slipped off this bug also flew away heading due north it didnt slacken its speed for even a moment

3349390 cuando inici el siglo pasado arboletes no exist a era un lugar despoblado propiedad de jos reales
3349391 comenz a cultivarse mucho arroz primero se comercializ en puerto rey pero poco a poco estos cultivadores comenzaron a asentarse en los terrenos cercanos
3349392 hacia 1906 se fue formando un caser o la primera v a de arboletes se llam la calle del afrecho porque all era donde las mujeres que quitaban las c scaras al arroz en unas pilonas enormes
3349393 bautizado as porque la gente reconoc a esta zona por la cantidad y el tama o de algunos rboles de la poca
3349394 la gente cre a que la zona del volc n estaba embrujado y que all se reun an brujas en un aquelarre que duraba toda la noche

3349398 es algo delicado que pienso debe tener apoyo nacional que debe ser cuidar las playas porque cada vez queda menos arena debido a la deforestaci n en este sector la tierra no ha tenido protecci n y eso es grave

3349416 although the chinese equity market has suffered a volatile few months there are many reasons to be confident about the long term outlook particularly following a correction earlier this year that has returned valuations to more realistic levels
3349417 the 12 month forward price earnings ratio per on the msci china index is currently 12 times this compares with 22 6 times at its peak in october 2007
3349418 certainly the slowdown in us demand has been more than offset by strong demand from emerging markets
3349419 for instance while chinas exports to the us rose by only 8 6 per cent in the first six months from a year earlier exports to india surged 52 4 per cent during the same period
3349420 the stronger demand from emerging markets helps to reduce chinas dependence on the us market
3349421 there are three main growth areas within the region that demonstrate indias growing stature in the global market place namely infrastructure investment and urbanisation
3349422 india has a five year plan 2007 to 2012 to spend 500bn on much needed infrastructure the result of better road systems and ports is expected to lead to increased flows of activity
3349423 at present power is twice as expensive in india as it is in china with half of the population having no access to any power the result is a potentially serious impediment to economic growth but the infrastructure plans mean that these issues will be addressed
3349424 we already know urbanisation has led to an increase in consumption at present 30 per cent of indias population lives in cities but we expect this number to increase by about five per cent over the next decade this large population shift will lead to greater demand for consumables
3349425 it is also important to focus on countries that have greater capacity to absorb commodity price inflation and those that will suffer a deteriorating balance of payments position as a result
3349426 however the situation is not comparable to the 1970s when a combination of high energy prices production shocks in food and poorly managed monetary policy led to economic crisis
3349427 this time many central banks in emerging markets have raised interest rates sharply in response to rising price pressures
3349428 earnings expectations for companies operating in emerging markets have moderated in 2008 but are still favourable

3349483 first of all they put on a killer show with levon playing drums most of the night and let me tell you the man still has that killer groove behind the skins that you hear on the old band classics his voice has weathered a bit but he is 60 years old and has survived throat cancer for crying out loud i was actually surprised by how good he still sounded now then to the reason that i got to meet him and the reason i now have even more respect for the man as a human being than i did before the drummer and singer in my band the hotshot freight train both teach middle school one of the english teachers at the school does a project with her kids where they write letters to celebrities that they like respect with the intentions of teaching the kids how to properly write a business style letter most of the celebs will send a photo or something back which is cool well the teacher kay norris also writes one as an example for the students she wrote hers to levon he calls the school last week asking for her tells her how much he respects teachers and that they are overworked and underpaid gives her his phone number and gives her 24 free tickets to the show and backstage passes we get to the show and in the middle of it all he dedicates the entire show to kay norris and the clinton middle school staff aferwards we get backstage and meet the band and levon comes out takes the time to talk to everyone one of us and is increadibly gracious i just shook his hand and told him how much i greatly appreciated his contribution to the world of music and just how much his music really means to me since there were so many people i didnt bother with the autograph picture routine as im sure he was tired and had already done more than enough for us i had already felt blessed enough just to meet the man anyways he then talks more with kay and tells him to call her to set up a conference style call for her classroom so he can speak to all of her students i was in awe in an age where so many celebrities are total jerks and seem to have no gratitude for their fans it was refreshing to meet a man who is a legend in the music industry and have him be so kind thankful and just seem to be such a genuinely good person i came away from the meeting with a tremendous amount of respect for mr helm

3349556 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential

3349562 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks

3349567 the importance of online advertising will continue to grow although it is not free of influence from economic fluctuations
3349568 against this backdrop we will strengthen our performance marketing solutions which are less dependent on general economic factors and will focus increasingly on new technologies to optimize process efficiency

3349576 auch wenn die abgeltungsteuer viele anleger dazu ermuntert ihr geld in steuerlich beg nstigte dachfonds zu investieren sollten sie bei der auswahl der fonds besonnen vorgehen
3349577 doch wenn der fonds dicht gemacht wird und die mittel nach 2009 neu angelegt werden ist der vermeintliche steuervorteil schnell dahin
3349578 wir konzentrieren uns auf fonds die aus der masse herausragen sie sollten sowohl den markt schlagen als auch in ihrer vergleichsgruppe einen spitzenplatz einnehmen
3349579 diese vorsichtige anlagepolitik wollen wir auch beibehalten bis sich die m rkte wieder stabilisiert haben
3349580 das erste halbjahr 2008 entspricht unseren erwartungen es war aber nicht zufrieden stellend
3349581 unsere tochter affilinet konnte den umsatz deutlich steigern w hrend adlink media nur eine leichte steigerung gegen ber dem vorjahr zeigt im domain marketing sedo blieb der umsatz erwartungsgem auch im zweiten quartal hinter dem vorjahr zur ck sedo ist nach wie vor von negativen effekten betroffen die bereits im ersten quartal 2008 berichtet wurden dabei handelt es sich um dauerhafte nderungen bei policy und algorithmen die unsere wichtigsten partner im suchmaschinen bereich vorgenommen haben au erdem schl gt sich die anhaltende schw che des dollar und des britischen pfundes in den zahlen nieder
3349582 die bedeutung der online werbung wird weiter zunehmen auch wenn sie nicht unbeeinflusst von konjunkturellen schwankungen bleibt
3349583 vor diesem hintergrund st rken wir unsere weniger konjunkturabh ngigen performancemarketing l sungen und setzen verst rkt neue technologien zur optimierung der prozesseffizienz ein f r den weiteren verlauf des gesch ftsjahres sind wir zuversichtlich und best tigen unsere mai prognose f r 2008 wir erwarten ein umsatzwachstum von 10 im konzern und ein vorsteuerergebnis in etwa auf dem niveau des vorjahres ohne sondereffekte d h von rund 21 mio eur

3349595 wouldnt it be nice to just go back to sleep
3349596 legally the police told me they couldnt do anything which is why i told them what i was planning on doing
3349597 they strongly discouraged me from meeting the guy and said they were concerned about my personal safety
3349598 he didnt know anything about the bike which was totally sketch
3349599 the most irritating thing about it was that he didnt do or say anything to vindicate himself when i told him it was my bike and it was stolen
3349600 it has been a consistent problem and very few bikes are ever recovered with fewer people ever being arrested we thought wed run this program and maybe make a few arrests but we have arrested a lot of people
3349601 we were expecting a certain kind of demographic but it has been across the board from homeless people to well established people in the community
3349602 everywhere i go i am looking for it although i know its probably not even in town anymore
3349603 you hate to tell people that it is unlikely we are going to be able to do much to help them out but the fact is it is very unlikely a bike will be found
3349604 there are so many bikes in the community to find one and point it out and to say its yours is hard our hope is that this program will change that
3349605 at this point in time our goal is to deter and stop bike thefts so people can come to campus and know their bikes will be there when they get out of class or leave their offices and need to get back home
3349606 please please please be wary about purchasing this bike as it is a stolen bike and i have a large networking system in place to get it back into my possession this is a warning to anyone who loves their babies on wheels

3349654 this feature has already been put into use by one of our industrial machinery suppliers when moving to digital information distribution
3349655 they needed to be able to set up multiple licenses for over 1 200 dealers and distributors for a new launch however they wanted to integrate issuing licenses with their existing web interface so that their dealers had a single common interface with them and not confuse them with multiple points of contact since the license files now show the dealers names they were easily generated and collected and organized internally by the manufacturer that meant that as the manufacturers new electronic service went live dealers received the announcement over their existing web portal dealers could pick up their license details directly from the web site using their existing interface for communications so its a win win for everyone the manufacturer knows who the license is for and can make sure it is in the right place to be collected the dealers retain a single point of contact and information and dont need to change the business processes they already have established and the manufacturer has cut out printing costs distribution costs can deliver rapidly and can issue new information immediately big cost savings
3349656 we aim to launch our new compact vehicles at 800 things gone wrong per 1 000 vehicles
3349657 thats more than 500 tgws less than the predicted industry average and we believe these levels will ensure our upcoming small cars will achieve industry best initial quality
3349658 were following a set of standardized processes around the world in product development manufacturing and purchasing with a discipline this company has never seen
3349659 we are leveraging these same disciplined standardized processes to ensure world class quality around the world
3349660 by 2012 well be building 1 million cars around the world on our new b car platform and 2 million vehicles our global c car platform

3349666 these international sites have been launched in local markets for those markets
3349667 the goal of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been ensured
3349668 whenever hotbeds of resistance and other aggressive plans emerge make the decision and eliminate them
3349669 if you receive the order to cease fire this would not mean that we would stop all operations including reconnaissance operations
3349670 they have taken the decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities into peace
3349671 the aim of our operation has been reached the safety of our peace keepers and the civilian population has been restored the aggressor has been punished
3349672 this is a step forward but the international community must ensure it means genuine peace on the ground and a genuine secession of the bombing
3349673 there may be some time lag before the order from russian president medvedev gets through to the rank and file
3349674 we have to review our policy can we consider a partner a country who behaves like this
3349675 its time to stop sticking our head in the sand
3349676 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3349677 i wouldnt hurt a fly but i would sell my grandmother
3349678 its like a neighborhood blackout now everyones out in the street trying to assess what went wrong

3349684 with the exception of new zealand every country we cover has begun raising policy rates and is expected to continue to do so for the rest of 2008
3349685 in recent weeks in recognition of at least the oil shock being more persistent most countries have allowed domestic fuel prices to increase even if partially
3349686 there is little question that as long as oil prices remain at current levels or even decline moderately the price adjustments will keep up the pressure on inflation rates across the region
3349687 in the last few months india china and indonesia have all trimmed their fuel subsidies gokarn said as asias millions of consumers begin to feel the pinch of higher prices global demand will likely fall putting downward pressure on oil prices gokarn said

3349715 dont throw in the towel please reserve whats on the table we have never been so close
3349716 two days after a failure such unanimous view was and remains surprising
3349717 ini bukan dia punya kuasa hal yang berkaitan dengan pengambilan pelajar adalah hal yang berkaitan dengan institusi pengajian yang berkenaan
3349718 saya sedar uitm sudahpun mengambil pelajar bukan melayu dan kebanyakannya adalah dari luar negara
3349719 saya tidak melihat apa apa kekurangan jika membuka institut ini kepda semua dan saya juga tidak merasakan satu kesalahan bagi saya memberikan pandangan sedemikian
3349720 kami mahu pelajar mengetahui pendirian kami dan kami menjemput mereka untuk taklimat daripada kami
3349721 kami juga bersedia ke uitm dan memberikan taklimat di sana jika tiada halangan ke atas kami
3349722 kami mendesak agar menteri besar memohon maaf dan menarik balik kenyataan tersebut syor 10 peratus tempat di uitm dibuka kepada bukan bumiputera
3349723 kita telah merancang pelan tindakan secara terpeinci susulan fasa kedua dan ketiga akan diteruskan termasuk memohon perkenan tuanku canselor tuanku mizan zainal abidin bertitah agar uitm tidak diganggu
3349724 kita melihat ini adalah taktik pihak tertentu menjelang pilihan raya kecil di permatang pauh nanti
3349725 sekiranya tujuannya ialah untuk itu politik maka tolonglah hentikan kerana telah termaktub dalam perkara 153 perlembagaan persekutuan yang ditubuhkan khas untuk bumiputera
3349726 saya amat tidak bersetuju kerana telah terbukti seperti apa yang berlaku di universiti universiti lain setiap kaum tertentu hanya akan bergaul dengan kaum mereka sendiri
3349727 ini bukan persaingan yang sihat keadaan ini lebih bahaya jika wujudnya perasaan mementingkan kaum sendiri walaupun belajar dalam satu institusi
3349728 kepentingan kita diperingkat pelajar sekarang ialah agar dapat mewujudkan jaringan hubungan dua hala dengan pelajar antarabangsa pada masa masa akan datang
3349729 kami komuniti pelajar uitm membantah keras pandangan membuka uitm sedemikian
3349730 kami mendapati alasan bahawa tindakan mengkhaskan uitm hanya kepada masyarakat bumiputera menyebabkan pelajar bumiputera kurang berinteraksi dan sebagainya adalah tidak benar
3349731 selepas ini kami akan menyerahkan memorandum yang serupa kepada perdana menteri dan kemudian yang di pertuan agong yang juga canselor uitm ini akan dilakukan minggu depan
3349732 sehingga malam ini isnin kami sudah memperoleh tandatangan menyokong memorandum bantahan daripada lebih 5 000 pelajar dan ia mungkin akan mencecah 10 000 orang esok
3349733 memorandum ini bertujuan meminta beliau menteri besar selangor menarik balik kenyataannya kerana bertentangan dengan prinsip penubuhan uitm sebagai sebuah institusi pengajian tinggi bagi melahirkan profesional di kalangan bumiputera
3349734 at this point were right under two million dollars for this fiscal year i think were number three in the nation per capita
3349735 people have actively resisted arrest or fought with agents or tried to run them over with vehicles
3349736 the criminal element is getting a little more desperate and resorting to more aggressive actions toward us and thats something agents have to be aware of and deal with on a daily basis
3349737 i hope that when they theyre on duty that the first thing they think about is making it back safe ive got trust in them that theyre going to take the necessary measures to protect themselves and the community

3349739 while the annual breakfast is a widely known event attended by a succession of u
3349740 the being who chose to embody these energies and to be in essence the angel of mans inner evolution is the being we know as lucifer
3349741 it is important to see that lucifer as i am using this term describes an angel a being a great and mighty planetary consciousness
3349742 christ is the same force as lucifer but moving in seemingly the opposite direction
3349743 lucifer works within each of us to bring us to wholeness and as we move into a new age which is the age of mans wholeness each of us in some way is brought to that point which i term the luciferic initiation the particular doorway through which the individual must pass p 44 lucifer comes to give to us the final gift of wholeness if we accept it then he is free and we are free that is the luciferic initiation it is one that many people now and in the days ahead will be facing for it s an initiation into the new age
3349744 its ok to take new age moneys to build the kingdom of god on earth
3349745 why dont you contact one of your friends who was there and duplicate their tapes
3349746 im fairly new around here and dont pretend to know all the ins and outs but something is definitely wrong

3349748 of course this is a big question and we are as concerned as you are to deal with the situation of that sort
3349749 what the government has been doing is to keep assuring to say that as far as malaysia is concerned we love peace like singaporeans love peace we love prosperity and we love unity that we have enjoyed for many decades

3349757 broken humans center their lives around things that seem good to them but that will neither fill them nor free them they are addicted to power or the illusion of security that power offers when a disaster happens those same people will turn against the false powers they trusted in their disappointment they either become softened toward me or they become bolder in their independence if you could only see how all of this ends and what we will achieve without the violation of one human will then you would understand

3349764 hes a good player who scored 17 league and cup goals for us last season but his representatives were constantly in touch with our chairman saying other clubs were going to make a bid
3349765 we never received anything but we took it that wasnt the behaviour of somebody who wants to play for the club
3349766 robbie is okay hes fit but he just needs to get his sharpness and ive told him that
3349767 if we can get him right then theres no reason why he cant play a part in the season
3349768 i struggled until i took a chance mixed my operatic style with pop in hellomagazine com
3349769 you need to go out and try to win every game
3349770 its great that we are playing at home and we need to impose ourselves
3349771 after that i dont look at this competition as a whole just on a game by game basis
3349772 gauri always wanted her kids to have a connect with her home town as well
3349773 when they were both about to leave they had a heated argument outside the restaurant they were doing a good amount of yelling
3349774 im alan yeah i just got into an argument with my drunk wife
3349775 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation but the victim also declined medical treatment
3349776 ill be seeing the chairman to ensure we can bring another player in
3349777 its important we add another striker we may have to be patient and wait until later in the month nearer the end of the current transfer window
3349778 but our quest could go into the september loan window for somebody from the premiership
3349779 at least we are almost at our quota now and we have four strikers challenging for two places
3349780 citys future is not in jeopardy in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3349781 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3349782 this is an exciting time to be involved with osu athletics
3349783 we have great momentum in our annual fundraising efforts and are grateful for the high level of participation in the posse from alumni parents fans staff and friends of osu
3349784 osu athletics receives no state funding so private support is critical to help oklahoma state student athletes compete at the highest levels
3349785 for us to achieve the ambitious goal of 10 000 posse members it is going to take a team effort we hope current members rally around this campaign and enlist and other family friends and alumni to help us continue to grow in this critical era of osu athletics no gift is too big or small for our student athletes participation is the key
3349786 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3349787 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3349788 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3349789 es gibt keinen grund die mittelfristigen aussichten in so d steren farben zu malen wie es einige der professionellen auguren nun tun
3349790 man sollte aber mit blick auf eine ged mpfte entwicklung bis in den herbst nicht schon das gespenst einer rezession an die wand malen
3349791 hier regiert zu einem gewissen teil das prinzip hoffnung aber angesichts der zur ckgehenden belastungsfaktoren und des robusten arbeitsmarkts ist es eine gut begr ndete hoffnung
3349792 wir sind jetzt nicht an einem punkt an dem man ber konjunkturprogramme reden muss
3349793 wir m ssen verhindern dass sich die erwartung in den k pfen festsetzt die inflationsrate k nnte mittelfristig so hoch bleiben wie sie jetzt ist und damit auch zur messlatte f r lohnverhandlungen werden
3349794 das k nnte bis weit ins n chste jahr hinein andauern
3349795 unser ziel ist es in der produktion wirkungsgrade von mindestens 16 5 prozent bei multikristallinem und von mindestens 18 prozent bei monokristallinem solarsilizium realisieren zu k nnen
3349796 unsere entwicklungst tigkeit ber cksichtigt auch die gestaltung des herstellungsprozesses mit dem ziel dass unsere kunden zeitnah unsere forschungsergebnisse nutzen k nnen durch unsere forschung und entwicklung wollen wir auch weiterhin dazu beizutragen die herstellungskosten in der photovoltaik zu senken
3349797 we aim at an efficiency of at least 16 5 percent for multi crystalline and at least 18 percent for mono crystalline solar silicon
3349798 our development activity also takes the structure of the manufacturing process into account to allow our customers to benefit promptly from the results the continued aim of our research and development is to make a contribution to reducing manufacturing costs in photovoltaics
3349799 approval of a joint contract that will cover both pilot groups immediately upon closing of the merger is an historic milestone in creating the worlds premier global airline and we are pleased that pilots from both airlines chose to take this important step to unify the pilot group todays ratification is a testament to the diligent efforts of alpas leadership working together with its members delta and northwest
3349800 with the cost of natural gas on the rise one of the best things customers can do is to get their heating system checked to ensure it is working properly and at top efficiency
3349801 by testing their heating systems early customers will be prepared for the cold weather ahead and well be able to respond more quickly now than before a large volume of calls come in on that first chilly morning
3349802 as we phase out our local analog simulcasts this year we want to make sure that our small number of affected customers can continue receiving this programming on sets they are using without a set top box
3349803 were reaching out to those customers now to help them get their free digital adapter from us so they can enjoy high quality digital programming on every set in their home
3349804 fios tv makes any tv look incredible even analog sets

3349806 we want to build open wheel racing back up and we believe that bringing other manufacturers into the irl is necessary to strengthen it
3349807 were competitive yes but on the other hand we want to use our competitive desire to build the series we welcome competition we want competition its what drives us
3349808 it was a very positive meeting and we were happy with the quality and quantity
3349809 we were very well represented with a dozen engine manufacturers and race shop engine builders in the room it was a very positive meeting from all aspects it probably exceeded our expectations
3349810 one being that with the diversity of the schedule that we run it the turbocharged engine is a great power control and helps us adjust power levels
3349811 also you cant underestimate the second positive which is simply its sound its the natural muffler with more road and street courses city streets and venues of those types on the schedule its nice to turn our adjustables down a little bit and its got a great sound to it
3349812 i think youll be seeing turbos in production cars very soon
3349813 i honestly think the participation level was higher than anyone could have imagined or i would have anticipated
3349814 and i would say it was clearly higher than it would have been had it not been for unification it was so clear that the unification and positive direction of open wheel racing is what triggered the high level of interest of everybody that was in the room
3349815 what was most encouraging is that throughout the discussions there was clearly more agreement than there was disagreement and a lot of energy for a follow up meeting and a lot of common ground
3349816 we said were willing to rewrite the rules if anybody thinks weve got an unfair advantage we told them to write the rules and tell us what we need to do well play with one hand tied behind our back if thats what people want
3349817 the encouraging thing is that all of them wanted to come back
3349818 the racing spirit is part of the culture at honda and racing is an analogy for everything we do

3349860 profound implications for the overall improvement of health status in this student population
3349861 is that nearly 2 480 more students reported 0 of 10 serious alcohol related consequences in 2006 versus 2001
3349862 we believe that the social norms marketing campaign has really had a fairly dramatic impact on the students at our university
3349863 as a clinician what i find so interesting about social norms marketing is that it shares many of the principles that we use in motivational counseling when we see an individual in a clinical setting it creates a discrepancy between what the patient may be doing or believing and what is actually the norm it presents the information in a very respectful and objective way that enable an individual to make a healthier decision

3349879 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3349880 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other disorders we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3349881 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3349882 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3349883 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved

3349887 the basic idea with wikia search is to have a freely licensed open source search engine in which all the software is released publicly
3349888 its designed wiki style so anyone can enter and change anything
3349889 every edit that you make is a public act so other people can check your work and see what youve done
3349890 weve reached a plateau in search theres a possibility that by re introducing some human intelligence into the process you can get better results
3349891 there are tools available that the community needs to self manage so that you can have aneffective community that keeps out spam and works on quality
3349892 a lot of it has to do with making progress with the ease of use of the tools for us its about product design and execution and being able to make something that people find useful then theyll come and use it

3349897 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3349898 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3349899 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3349900 dance close up reflects the breadth of styles and expertise among the universitys dance faculty

3349906 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3349907 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3349908 there was never a big grand plan we just wanted to have a nice time make good clothes and have a successful business
3349909 when we started we were doing everything it was crazy
3349910 the first show i sat everyone and then i modeled and the next day i went to the showroom and sold it and then i paid the bills and betsey did the patterns
3349911 shes the best and i look forward to it every season

3349915 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3349916 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3349917 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3349934 we always lose by four or five runs we should have done better
3349935 weve already played canada and japan and china this year
3349936 the gaps have closed and we recognize that its going to be interesting i dont take anything for granted i think its going to be a little bit harder

3349946 a small number of detainees at campsfield have refused their meals in recent days
3349947 the situation is under control and the matter is under review
3349948 but we have got our priorities straight in 2007 we deported the highest ever number of foreign lawbreakers up by a huge 80 and we are committed to removing those who have no legal basis to stay in the uk
3349949 t he one negative thats really hit me is how bad the roads are
3349950 the streets are in terrible shape public works isnt going to be happy about me saying that but there are a lot of bumpy roads and things like that that need to be dealt with
3349951 been a priority the city council has identified so its a priority to me
3349952 it does seem from what i know that it is one of those move the community over the edge kind of things in terms of the kinds of projects it would fund that would help make the community a more special place
3349953 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
3349954 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals
3349955 the album will be stuffed with themes of guilt and reincarnation as well as the past present and future of
3349956 it is a violation of a persons human rights to take advantage of another person when they are in a vulnerable situation and we urge that these crimes are reported and that the perpetrators are appropriately punished
3349957 when you go out to the community and ask them to support bond referendums and cant deliver on simple things such as street paving youre going to have problems

3349960 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3349961 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3349962 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3349963 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3349964 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
3349965 so at the end of the day they decided to have both

3349970 historically typewriters have been an issue because their parts can be turned into weapons
3349971 is very heavy and could be used as a club
3349972 its disappointing that the department of corrections could not have found a middle ground that protected inmate safety while allowing some access to typewriters
3349973 inmate restrictions should be linked to actual and demonstrable safety risks especially when they affect a fundamental right such as access to the court system
3349974 the ban on typewriters was implemented for safety and security and is in no way intended to affect inmate litigation
3349975 to say we are in a crisis is not an exaggeration
