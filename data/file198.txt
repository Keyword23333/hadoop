1980152 im using the maven jaxb plugin in my maven2 based project to generate a bunch of java classes corresponding to my xmlschema that is shared between client and server applications the codegen part works great as per the instructions for the plugin the jaxb source generator is indeed invoked at the right time and the generated classes are compiled along with the manually created sources in the usual place src main java however the javadoc plugin only wants to look at the classes in the default location thats bad for me because im decorating the schema with appropriate javadoc comments the generated model classes are part of the public api for my service how can i use this plugin but also convince the javadoc plugin to generate javadocs for both the default located classes and the generated classes
1980153 this is a limitation of the java class specification which i think also applies to any bytecode driven language not just java

1980264 we used to think our content was perfect just exactly as it was we expected our business would remain blissfully unaffected even as the world of interactivity constant connection and file sharing was exploding and of course we were wrong how were we wrong by standing still or moving at a glacial pace we inadvertently went to war with consumers by denying them what they wanted and could otherwise find and as a result of course consumers won
1980265 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
1980266 what we need to be careful of is that we do not allow an ecosystem to occur where we are not properly compensated
1980267 the industry simply assumes that if something makes use of their content all of the value is in the content thats incorrect yes the content is a part of the value but its the game thats making that content valuable this is the same thing thats been true of so many other services that the industry has freaked out about from napster to youtube to seeqpod and many others until the recording industry recognizes that this isnt a zero sum game and someone out there promoting your content is helping to make it more valuable the industry is never going to figure out how to really adapt

1980272 in spite of the widespread claims of continuing and even accelerating growth rates internet traffic growth appears to be decelerating
1980273 traffic growth rates of 50 per year appear to only about offset technology advances as transmission capacity available for a given price steadily increases thus although service providers are pushing to throttle customer traffic an argument can be made that they should instead be encouraging more traffic and new applications to fill the growing capacity of transmission links

1980324 although the nra and i have certainly had our disagreements over the year i hope that we can agree that the gun violence prevention debate should be based upon an open and honest exchange of ideas not on underhanded tactics
1980325 one of the reasons we have lobbying disclosure rules is so that the public knows whos lobbying the elected but also so the elected know whos coming before them and whos really paying them
1980326 we used informants that we would send to public rallies that these people were holding public demonstrations these informants developed relationships where they could pick up a phone and call in to find out where the next event was where it was going to be held they are usually very eager to have somebody come and tote banners and scream and shout
1980327 this reinforces what we have long known that the gun lobby will go to any lengths no matter how unethical to protect the profits of the gun industry in this country even at the expense of the over 30 000 americans who lose their lives to gun violence each year

1980351 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
1980352 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
1980353 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

1980362 we wanted to reveal the mechanism behind central sleep apnea which most commonly affects people after age 65
1980363 unlike obstructive sleep apnea in which a person stops breathing when their airway collapses central sleep apnea is triggered by something going awry in the brains breathing center
1980364 we were surprised to see that breathing completely stopped when the rat entered rem sleep forcing the rat to wake up in order to start breathing again
1980365 over time the breathing lapses increased in severity spreading into non rem sleep and eventually occurring when the rats were awake as well
1980366 our research suggests that the preb tzinger complex contains a fixed number of neurons that we lose as we age
1980367 essentially we sped up these cells aging process in the rats over several days instead of a lifetime
1980368 we speculate that our brains can compensate for up to a 60 percent loss of preb tc cells but the cumulative deficit of these brain cells eventually disrupts our breathing during sleep theres no biological reason for the body to maintain these cells beyond the average lifespan and so they do not replenish as we age
1980369 as we lose them we grow more prone to central sleep apnea
1980370 people with these diseases breathe normally when they are awake but many of them have breathing difficulties during sleep
1980371 when central sleep apnea strikes they are already very ill and their sleep disordered breathing may go unnoticed
1980372 as the patients grow sicker their nighttime threshold for wakefulness rises
1980373 eventually their bodies reach a point when they are unable to rouse themselves from sleep when they stop breathing and they die from lack of oxygen
1980374 it video advertising will be like instant messaging its ubiquitous but no one makes money on it
1980375 it video advertising will have to be a very different kind of advertising if someone does figure it out then google will be in a good position
1980376 the environment surrounding our business has taken a sharp turn for the worse leading to a very tough first quarter
1980377 it will be crucial for us to act quickly and flexibly to overcome this
1980378 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1980379 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
1980380 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
1980381 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
1980382 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
1980383 the number eight is very lucky in china so we decided to get married on the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008
1980384 it doesnt matter that it is so quick or that our friends and family will be too busy watching the opening ceremony to celebrate with us we will have a proper wedding in october
1980385 lots of young parents would love to have their baby on august 8 and the first day of the olympics it is a very lucky day
1980386 if people come in desperate to give birth on a certain day we are not prepared to give unnecessary elective caesarean sections the most important thing is the health of the baby not the day it is born
1980387 since i started exercising my pelvic muscles have opened a bit so maybe i can give birth a couple of days early
1980388 in any case i will go to the hospital on august 8 i have heard there is an injection that induces labour
1980389 our parents wish we could have the baby on friday
1980390 but our hospital is all booked up on that day the doctor said he might be able to give us a bed in a corridor

1980400 frankly i wouldnt be here if i thought she wasnt still cooperating with me
1980401 ive just been informed by the visitation supervisor that when visitation session started casey anthony was not at the visitation unit over in her housing area correctional officer came on over the screen and told mr anthony that casey did not wish to have the visit occur and then he left

1980406 theyre just laying out there waiting for somebody to hit them
1980407 once you pointed it out to me i started looking and they were all over the place
1980408 it seems strange to me that you would put something like this in the middle of the street that could fly up and crash into a car
1980409 theyre playing with peoples lives when they leave those out there
1980410 we will try to break the factory wall as many times as we can
1980411 we are not against industrialization or tata we only want back the 400 acres acquired from us forcibly
1980412 we will not budge till we see an end to it i am still holding out i am ready to face death to get back my land
1980413 we have been able to convince 80 percent of the workers to leave the plant
1980414 tata motors is progressing its project work at singur towards starting production in the october december quarter of 2008
1980415 ultimately it is up to the state to determine whether they want industrialization or not
1980416 we will continue there as long as our patience lasts
1980417 the project work is nearing completion i hope nano will roll out on time
1980418 that is going to mean more favorable turnout patterns it is going to help us register voters it is going to help us organizationally

1980437 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
1980438 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
1980439 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
1980440 he claimed to be a german student and i think he had already finished
1980441 we just figured out everything was not what it was
1980442 hes not in the yearbook theres no record of him theres no footprint of him but he was there
1980443 we want the chinese government to understand the actual cost of their support to the people inside of burma
1980444 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
1980445 i was in mandalay at the time in my second year studying psychology at university
1980446 we organised a big protest in which some students were killed right in front of me we took their bodies put them on our motorbikes and drove them away then we came back to continue protesting
1980447 we people although we hate the government we cannot do anything we have no arms while the military have a lot it is also very difficult to unite people again
1980448 most of the people are more concerned about their lives and their businesses as the economy is going down still i think the burmese are hoping the situation in the country will get better one day
1980449 se sienten cansados en el trabajo incluso se duermen al conducir el 30 por ciento dice que tiene somnolencia al conducir

1980451 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
1980452 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1980453 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
1980454 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
1980455 youve got these subatomic particles accelerated at great speeds for the sole purpose of being destroyed no one thinks of the ethical implications of this
1980456 theres a limited supply of hadrons in the universe do we just want to go around destroying them what if we run out what if the hadrons can feel pain will we look back at this hundreds of years from now and regret it kinda like we do with the killing of bacteria with antibiotics now
1980457 weve got the wackos who think were going to rip a hole in the universe and the people who think our real purpose is to create a race of dr manhattans but this is just weird
1980458 thats what they said about the other group i founded mothers against undead drivers which warns people of driving while a zombie but theyll see
1980459 like his late father is a roman catholic who opposes abortion rights
1980460 despite obamas view on abortion catholics still divided over his candidacy
1980461 the service chiefs dont want tsvangirai to have executive powers
1980462 they wonder how they will relate to him after they issued statements before the elections that they would not salute him if he won
1980463 they are against the ceding of too much power to tsvangirai
1980464 they are also afraid of being punished for human rights abuses
1980465 msika questioned why tsvangirai whom he considers to be a puppet of the west should sit in cabinet he is of the opinion that tsvangirai should not be part of government
1980466 the president was frank that we now have a hung parliament and as such tsvangirai and his party should be in an inclusive government
1980467 people here remember what they want and call it history that much is true almost any place in the world but in the south if people arent careful history can start to run their lives even put them at risk
1980468 even tried document write radaccess but as you have figured out that didnt work out well
1980469 the dma is a growing and successful organisation but the market is changing as a result our structure vision operational speed internal structures and member services are being reviewed
1980470 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
1980471 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1980472 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
1980473 and aretha would be at the top of the list of soul singers but she is in no way a rock and roller
1980474 the first woman inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame
1980475 we are hoping for the opportunity to introduce the small four passenger mitsubishi i miev to pg amp es fleet in the fourth quarter of this year so that we can begin real world u s testing the joint partnership will yield valuable data and a greater appreciation of the practicality of an all electric vehicle in california
1980476 pg amp e has been researching the benefits of electric vehicles since the nineties partnering with automakers like mitsubishi is vital to developing compatible infrastructures to support electric vehicles in the marketplace and ensure responsible integration with the grid
1980477 by working with mitsubishi we will both benefit from a free exchange of electric vehicle information that includes charging infrastructure availability vehicle data vehicle commercialization expectations and public feedback
1980478 knowledge is just opinion that you trust enough to act upon
1980479 to this day there is probably code inside windows that only aaron really understood why it was there
1980480 he was busy he would continue to work for as long as 5 to 10 minutes until he had finished whatever it was he was dealing with and only then would he check to see if you were still there
1980481 send us an expert who can teach us how to migrate from access to mysql

1980483 find out how much it costs to ship 30 computers from the uk to ghana
1980484 search for background information and pictures of the refugees in buduburam
1980485 the contrast between the two is a bit more nuanced than departmental vs enterprise and collaboration vs ilm generally speaking yes sharepoint is better suited to the former and oracle the latter but the story gets murkier when you dig into the details of each product
1980486 the thing is to see ucm as part of the fusion platform in that context it is a true and a whole array of web services identity management etc and importantly supports ilm thoroughly
1980487 so by all means give the fiio e3 a try if you want to add some higher quality bass to your portable setup cut down on some predominant treble or want to drive some higher impedance phones with a bit more impact it might not work with every headphone out there and it might add some background hiss to some phones but at 8 50 its definitely worth a try maybe you find some good synergy i know i did the fiio is a fun toy that added some new excitement to my uber portable workout rig and i sure intend to keep the amp with me on the go
1980488 get the inquirer they arent facts unless you pay for them
1980489 read the inquirer news looks better in ink than pixels
1980490 in a few years time we will see a growing market for this convenient and environmentally friendly way of reading books news and documents
1980491 doesnt it get you so man when men come up to you like this dont you think theyre just pigs dont you want to hurt them

1980493 the swellers will write you a personalized song like say anything
1980494 products like the asus eee pc have demonstrated the huge potential market for linux based oem netbook solutions and other emerging mobile linux platforms
1980495 along with the development of the related netbook market segment have created both the opportunity as well as need to facilitate third party development of richer and more digital applications and for one click delivery of their content
1980496 this is really some of the most exciting news since the announcement of freespire 1 0
1980497 this is what we were hoping to see both the continued development of freespire and a return to a debian base
1980498 a combined xandros linspire development effort will return freespire to its debian gnu linux roots and put it in sync with xandros desktop pro
1980499 we will have a leading edge code base while preserving our commitment to debian stability windows interoperability and ease of use this commitment allows us to meet the needs of a wide range of users from open source enthusiasts to demanding enterprise clients in addition we are intensifying our commitment to the freespire open source community which will now help to drive both the freespire and xandros products

1980504 we were looking to combine the three ministries into one effort and take a more holistic approach to each person each family and their circumstance
1980505 we spent a lot of time creating an environment that is warm and dignified for people
1980506 everything here is about relationships and getting to know people making a connection and serving their real needs and the roots of whats put them into a situation

1980508 theres a point when a church reaches critical mass and youre able to do things on a larger scale it does help to be this size
1980509 you consider the number of people you can authentically pastor i say its about 10 to 12 so to combat that we get people into smaller groups and smaller contexts where people can be real and honest and authentic
1980510 when i found out about this job ministry i felt like im home
1980511 i prayed to find a ministry where i could help people find a career or a calling that set their souls on fire that would excite them to go to work the next day life is too short to be in a job you cant stand

1980518 mozilla does something similar http www mozilla com en us b locklist seems like a reasonable
1980519 congress has clearly reflected a keen interest in just these kinds of choices
1980520 we want to make sure that we can help them understand the extent of these choices
1980521 what yahoo is doing is better than before but i think most consumers would expect that if they opt out then the information will no longer be collected
1980522 as a business we collect data for many reasons including legal reporting fraud detection financial auditing law enforcement compliance and research to improve our services
1980523 were proud to report the best june quarter for both revenue and earnings in apples history
1980524 we set a new record for mac sales we think we have a real winner with our new iphone 3g and were busy finishing several more wonderful new products to launch in the coming months

1980526 looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we expect revenue of about 7 8 billion and earnings per diluted share of about 1 00
1980527 youre looking at a few people who got in at the beginning of the year and made a lot of money

1980540 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
1980541 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
1980542 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes

1980547 in reality the only possibility of avoiding such a crunch appears to be if a major recession reduces demand and even then such an outcome may only postpone the problem
1980548 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
1980549 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
1980550 obviously it makes it harder but there is three weeks between the two finals and we will have at least two weeks off in that time because we only play every second day
1980551 cincinnati last week was hotter than it is here but the humidity is really tough youre sweating so much
1980552 if i do well in both events i will definitely have to play singles and doubles on the same day obviously it makes it harder but its a great opportunity for me to play with my brother
1980553 i saw lu a lot when i was moving through the rankings
1980554 hes been ranked around 90 150 for the last few years so i obviously played quite a few tournaments with him during the challengers hes tough hes used to these conditions and hes pretty solid from the baseline but if i play well i should win
1980555 im taking each match as it comes but if i can get to the third round or quarters then who knows what might happen
1980556 youve got to try and get involved with the other athletes
1980557 if you stay in a hotel its more like playing in a normal tennis tournament
1980558 its obviously completely different to what im used to when you go to the dining room its like being back at a massive school so many people in there and its so long its just a completely different experience theres been a few autograph requests from other athletes but its not been stressful at all
1980559 to win any grand slam would be huge and the same with the olympics
1980560 a gold medal in the olympics is something if you look at overall sports is a big deal for everybody but within tennis circles winning wimbledon or the us open would be bigger

1980570 the soc is to get a few sets of cardiac enzymes on these patients and to perform a stress test if either is positive the patient may be considered for cardiac catheterization
1980571 at nearly every age level women are less likely to have coronary artery disease than men they are more likely to be found to have normal coronaries on cardiac ct and therefore more likely to be discharged since they are discharged costs go down
1980572 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
1980573 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
1980574 i think the day may come when this technology is regularly used to triage patients that would otherwise end up waiting for hours in the emergency department for a stress test and another set of cardiac enzymes as physicians design protocols that further reduce the radiation dose associated with exams and as engineers design faster multislice cts the radiation dose the main major risk of the procedure will fall
1980575 coronary ct angiography is more efficient than a stress test in the identification of coronary artery disease

1980579 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work in this regard
1980580 the main thing to remember is that the negotiating track is open it is being pursued there are contacts between the parties of course some parties do raise the issue of sanctions from time to time

1980586 ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
1980587 the good news is that most people are coping well and continuing to pay their mortgages in full despite the higher costs of food and fuel and the higher mortgage rates now prevailing in the market for those coming off cheaper original deals
1980588 for years house prices and personal debt were allowed to soar unchecked and ordinary families are now feeling the effects
1980589 no one wants to see a household lose their home and repossession typically leads to a loss for the lender as well
1980590 the focus of lenders arrears management policies today is on seeking realistic alternatives that balance the interests of customer and lender
1980591 anyone who thinks they may be heading towards financial problems should contact their lender to discuss their options the earlier the better
1980592 inching ever closer to the dark days of the last repossession crisis
1980593 we know that behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
1980594 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes and provide the significant financial support troubled homeowners need to keep a roof over their head
1980595 whilst the rate of repossessions is not on the same scale as the early 90s we want to ensure that the right support is in place for those who might need it now because of global economic pressures
1980596 thats why we are expanding free legal representation at county courts which can make a real difference in ensuring that repossession is only ever used as a last resort
1980597 why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
1980598 we cannot speculate on the consequences for prices obviously its a positive element for europe but other elements are also important especially the state of stocks around the world
1980599 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
1980600 we have believed i have been taught that there are two scarcities in society talent and attention there are only so many people with talent and we give their talent only so much attention not enough of either
1980601 but we are shifting too from a culture of scarcity to one of abundance that is the essence of the google worldview managing abundance so lets assume that instead of a scarcity there is an abundance of talent and a limitless will to create but it has been tamped down by an educational system that insists on sameness starved by a mass economic system that rewarded only a few giants and discouraged by a critical system that anointed a closed small creative class now talent of many descriptions and levels can express itself and grow we want to create and we want to be generous with our creations and we will get the attention we deserve that means that crap will be ignored it just depends on your definition of crap
1980602 a quicker and more effective way of discouraging this unlawful activity
1980603 many of these screenscrapers do not provide consumers with any useful services because consumers know that they will get the lowest fares only on ryanair com
1980604 however in recent weeks genuine passengers using ryanairs website have been suffering long processing times and slower access because of the huge volume of information being downloaded from our website by these screenscrapers all over europe
1980605 in all cases this scraping activity is unlawful and in breach of both ryanair coms copyright and terms of use
1980606 at a time when many people are struggling to afford holidays overseas airlines should be finding ways to make it easier for families to book and travel in the way that is convenient for them not making it even harder
1980607 this has never happened before airlines and travel agents work closely together and have done for years
1980608 they have taken a very very unfair and unreasonable approach
1980609 i am very pleased that carolyn has agreed to join our senior leadership team at princeton
1980610 she is a highly regarded and seasoned manager with more than 20 years of experience in a university setting and a reputation for being unusually thoughtful perceptive and decisive we are confident that she will provide the strategic financial counsel and the strong management we need to realize our aspirations in the areas for which she will be responsible
1980611 i have known carolyn for many years and have great admiration and respect for the important role she has played in managing the finances of a complicated peer institution

1980634 drew was getting severely beaten and thats why he used the knife
1980635 this fight is eerily similar to what happened with greg kennedy
1980636 i honestly dont believe he meant to punch a cop
1980637 if you know him hes very animated i think he was approaching the officer waving his hands and it came to this
1980638 were very glad that hes going to stay in jail until the very end of this thing
1980639 that is what we feel he as well as the other person deserves

1980649 robinho is very angry with the way the madrid bosses are dealing with him
1980650 he didnt like at all the idea of being fourth choice in the plans madrid have had this summer first they wanted to sign cristiano ronaldo but couldnt their second option was rafael van der vaart third is david villa robinho is fourth
1980651 robinhos plan was to play for real madrid for many years
1980652 where can he find a better club than madrid but he no longer feels that way he is getting affection from scolari he knows robinho well and calls him every day
1980653 i have been trying to speak with someone from the club for three days
1980654 robinho does not understand what is going on he calls me every day to know whether anyone has spoken to me about his future and i always have to tell him that no one has called his ambition is to become the best player in the world but he wont achieve that at madrid because they treat him like a normal player
1980655 this is the classic chicken and egg scenario where each link in the chain is looking to the other to take the first step before they commit
1980656 we intend to take a leadership role in engaging government and the business sector in driving change here in australia
1980657 we also believe you have to offer affordable solutions that recognise that people have different budgets
1980658 not everyone can afford a several thousand dollar premium currently required to buy a hybrid
1980659 and depending on their driving situation there might be better solutions for them anyway
1980660 in short wed be turning our backs on people who would be looking to local car makers the most for an affordable solution

1980677 we just had our signs and they their tear gas we formed our group to advocate for a return to constitutional order the junta authorises people to demonstrate in their favour but try to silence us
1980678 we condemn the anti constitutional taking of power and still recognize the legitimacy of our first democratically elected president the military needs to resume its role of protecting the country
1980679 life has become so expensive since president sidi ould cheikh abdallahi took power you never know how much fish is you cannot find meat at the markets he did not know what it takes to be a president and didnt really care about the people
1980680 because he is a man of faith older wise an intellectual but these things dont necessarily make for a good president and we need a change
1980681 i have a good feeling about him we will wait and see we are a country with so much natural wealth yet we are so poor we really need someone who can help us we are hoping he aziz will be better we hope because we have to
1980682 i participated as an election observer mohamed ould abdel aziz was personally responsible for sidi ould cheikh abdallahi becoming president and though abdallahis name was on the ballot and he was elected in what i can confirm was a democratic and transparent election it has always been aziz who has had the power
1980683 mohamed ould abdel aziz will either find another puppet will recruit one of this military men to run such as post coup transitional military leader from 2005 2007 ely ould mohamed vall or will he himself stand for president
1980684 i felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every panda that wouldnt screw to save its species

1980695 i feel so sorry because shes dead she was just a very good person
1980696 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
1980697 getting what you want is a pretty amazing feeling even if that feeling is fleeting you might as well hold on to it for as long as you can it probably isnt good for you no cravings ever are if people look at you sideways sometimes you have to ignore them stick them in a frame thats nailed to a wall in another room
1980698 these are some armenians nikki tinker is supported by the armenians and these are armenian photographers who were harassing me last night and are continuing to harass me and they should be out of here they have gotten in my face i want these people out of my house
1980699 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
1980700 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1980701 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1980702 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1980703 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest
1980704 the third stage of agrarian reform constituting the basic feature of the
1980705 its time now and its not unique to us its born out of necessity
1980706 as it became apparent they werent going to continue to function they decided to sell off the license we swooped in and grabbed it we took no assets there was nothing to be had to be honest were building everything from the ground up
1980707 youll venture through space exploring new civilizations and life forms
1980708 youll also beam down to planets and have adventures inside your ship its a galactic wide game theres going to be tons of space to investigate we have a great system for exploration which will allow for almost infinite possibilities
1980709 there might be a ship called enterprise flying around but its probably not the same ship anymore
1980710 most of the characters will have either retired or passed on but youll definitely be going to all the places you know and love from star trek expect to see oldies like vulcan and bajor but also fan favorites like andoria and qonos
1980711 youre going to see the actual game working and functioning
1980712 this isnt renders this isnt concept art everything that people will see on sunday is going to be taken right from star trek online as it stands today so hardened people should know that a release date might be closer than they think
1980713 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
1980714 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
1980715 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
1980716 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1980717 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
1980718 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
1980719 the conditions were much tougher than i expected this morning so i was happy that i was still able to go out and put together a decent score
1980720 the putter was the key to the round i putted pretty well yesterday but the greens were spiked up so i was excited about what i would be able to do in fresher conditions today
1980721 you never know you might shoot an 8 over and it comes down to sunday and you can still have a chance to win
1980722 the course is playing a lot harder today than yesterday
1980723 the winds a lot harder i know the guys playing in the afternoon its going to be very challenging for them
1980724 now if i could only get her to have sex with me
1980725 the well off suburb of eagan but holds blue collar credentials
1980726 of course as evidence comes in that suggests otherwise well deal with that as well
1980727 we came together and got some stuff that we needed to have looked at and were all satisfied with that
1980728 had he been the father of the child they certainly would have known
1980729 you got some kind of particle physics going on there
1980730 were into the immersive experience its a holodeck kind of thing
1980731 i can turn this room into the south of france i can turn this pillar into a waterfall
1980732 were not just doing cool things for cool things sake were using our technology to make extensions of a brand
1980733 were trying to pull these companies out of the stone age
1980734 we took a shot of the islands with a helicopter flyover camera
1980735 the thing about working with these guys is you never know quite how a projects going to come out you just know they have great taste and are going to wow everybody
1980736 its not like you do one thing with them and thats it
1980737 they ask you what do you need to get done and they take it as a personal challenge to get that done regardless of your budget
1980738 in view of the developments within the business environment and the strategic review process still under way tiscalis board of directors intends to review the business plan in the fourth quarter of this year
1980739 the changed conditions in the broadband market and telecommunication services in general
1980740 ok if this is my life what do i care about and why
1980741 this has implications for our picture of neanderthals and perhaps the reasons for their extinction if the population was teetering on the brink for hundreds of thousands of years it maybe changes our impression of what it would have taken to make them go extinct rather than if there were millions of them
1980742 especially now with all the new technology because even i can shoot the camera
1980743 the more i thought about carter the more i started thinking about high noon
1980744 the idea of the ageing peacemaker who should be in retirement having once again to strap on his guns in jimmy carters case hes strapping on his heart and soul and coming forth into town one last time to confront his adversaries those who would perpetuate violence its gary cooper striding down the street all alone no ones stronger than the really old guy who takes on a good mission when he should be allowed to be on the porch in his rocking chair
1980745 one of the very first things corman tells you as a new director is that youve got to make sure your adversary is every bit as strong and interesting as your protagonist
1980746 so when we were filming at the carter centre in atlanta and the consul from israel was identified as being in the audience i was like oh my god ive got to get him i was desperate for points of view in opposition i chased him across the grounds of the carter centre and in the end i was lucky enough to have this very attractive guy giving a very heartfelt non didactic comment
1980747 he was a tremendously important figure to have in there
1980748 as a person of his generation i felt his pain i grew up with the emerging documentation of the holocaust im not jewish yet i know the profound impact that had on me so if youre a jewish american of that generation i get dershowitzs pain and his rage
1980749 in america you almost want to apologise for being a jimmy carter fan
1980750 but i dont apologise surely now in the run up to this particular election jimmy carter must be seen as the great president
1980751 kowtowing to the pro israeli lobby position and showing incredible insensitivity to the palestinian side carter never got brainwashed maybe thats why he didnt get a second term
1980752 strap george bush into a chair and make him watch man from plains again and again and again
1980753 they hit him with all the strong stuff and he responded he didnt persuade anyone nor was his mind changed but everybody got to say what they wanted to say and it ended beautifully with a prayer circle one of the rabbis gave a blessing and wept
1980754 because id been banking on that scene but then i thought well this is a documentary and this is what happened
1980755 i have no interest im a working film maker so i dont need that much money to live and i just cant take the fashioning of the product aspect to all that ive had my fill of it
1980756 we pretended that what the actors were doing was reality and we responded to it as we would in any documentary
1980757 we never did a take two of any shot we did the scenes a number of times but always from a new perspective the actors loved it because the more you do a take the more youre going to drain the spontaneity out of a performance
1980758 shamefully i was delighted when brandeis refused him permission to come because now we have some adversaries
1980759 and then they decided no he could come so that gave us our final gunfight hell waltz on to this fiercely pro israel campus and confront the students and his views will be tested to the maximum
1980760 and then he jumps in the car to the airport and hes off to darfur
1980761 is the explanation for our existence everything we know about life is explained by it
1980762 it will be harder because this is going to be a larger distribution were at least at two dvds and on the pc we might choose to be three dvds to match what the game will look like for the ps3
1980763 so that makes for a pretty damn big download i wouldnt say its an optimal game for digital distribution and i dont think its a high level strategic question
1980764 well its hard to second guess exactly what the reasons are you can say piracy you can say user migration but the ground truth is just that the sales numbers on the pc are not what they used to be and are not what they are on the consoles
1980765 we still think the pc is a market worth supporting but were not making decision around the pc its probably more of the junior partner in the cross platform strategy although obviously our day to day development is predominately on the pc
1980766 as the confused but brilliant scientist lays gasping for breath on the floor after taking an overdose the camera pulls back to see a shadowy figure in the foreground with the queer smile on his lips he walks out of sight as the credits roll
1980767 absence of the vice president and pending the election of a president pro tempore
1980768 copa facially violates the first and fifth amendment rights of the plaintiffs because 1 copa is not narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of congress 2 defendant has failed to meet his burden of showing that copa is the least restrictive and most effective alternative in achieving the compelling interest and 3 copa is impermissibly vague and overbroad
1980769 given the vast quantity of speech that copa does not cover but that filters do cover it is apparent that filters are more effective in advancing congress s interest as it made plain it is in copa moreover filters are more flexible than copa because parents can tailor them to their own values and needs and to the age and maturity of their children and thus use an appropriate flexible approach differing from copa s one size fits all approach finally the evidence makes clear that although not flawless with proper use filters are highly effective in preventing minors from accessing sexually explicit material on the web
1980770 10 years later court still telling us govt that filters better than bad law
1980771 people who believe that informed citizens are important in a democracy
1980772 jack dangermond is a unique and outstanding promoter of cartography mapping and geography
1980773 he is able to bridge the gap between research ideas and the intentions of cartographers on one side and real practical needs of users from many different fields on the other
1980774 jack dangermond is a pioneer defining and delimiting the use of cartography and geographic information in support of the uns millennium development goals and the creation of a true knowledge based society
1980775 i do believe that if we are going to ever wean ourselves off of foreign oil were going to have to do it with nuclear in the mix
1980776 we should be rewarding colombia for the progress it has made the move to democracy the move to a secure situation in that country the move to respect human rights
1980777 im in the right place in the right time to answer questions
1980778 it looks to me like this is telling us the opening ceremonies are right on the border
1980779 anything you can name they can make in china and they are proud of it
1980780 its not good for clean air but they have a booming economy
1980781 they are trying to do in weeks what is going to take decades
1980782 it will slow them down but theyre competing in the same air
1980783 the classic example of a fingerprint is an ink imprint showing the unique swirls and loops used for identification but fingerprints also leave behind a unique distribution of molecular compounds
1980784 some of the residues left behind are from naturally occurring compounds in the skin and some are from other surfaces or materials a person has touched
1980785 road tripping through the pacific northwest crash studying the industry
1980786 ive always had the utmost respect for pyramid they were an early leader in the industry that we often looked to for insight ideas and leadership did bob johnson magic hat brewmaster get the idea for using apricot essence from pyramid frankly not sure he had tried it but had also tried a raft of other beers fruit and otherwise
1980787 while both 9 amp apricot ale both technically use apricot they are dramatically different beers
1980788 for the best part of a decade i have enjoyed working for the army this is not a decision that i have taken lightly
1980789 this was a deliberate attack requiring a long chase with revenge in mind
1980790 it was an attack carried out without any regard to the standards and rules that we live by and no thought for the victim his friends and his family
1980791 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
1980792 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
1980793 you have shown a tendency to use violence when it suits you
1980794 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
1980795 i am so moved and proud tonight to see my country put on such an olympic games
1980796 this is the biggest holiday for chinese people this is a chance for the world to meet china
1980797 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can go forth give it all you got
1980798 its got to be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
1980799 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
1980800 we corens are here now because the ancestors of these poles now going home used to amuse themselves at easter by locking jews in the synagogue and setting fire to it
1980801 the option to return to poland was not there for him for obvious reasons and by 1945 the poland he had left did not exist anymore
1980802 my sympathy for the plight of the modern polack is thus limited and if england is not the land of milk and honey it appeared to them three or four years ago then frankly they can clear off out of it
1980803 insulting even inflammatory in the same way as terms like nigger
1980804 weve received a handful of complaints about an article by giles coren and will consider whether there has been any breach of the code
1980805 negative emotions and tensions between the new eu immigrants and local communities
1980806 an international train from krakow to prague ran into a collapsed bridge which fell on the rails in the area of the town studenka
1980807 there are some dead but we do not have precise numbers because our people are rather devoting time to rescue those still alive
1980808 all staff have been called to service and we have freed a number of beds to make room for the injured
1980809 i travel by this train once a week when im travelling to school and its always so overcrowded that there isnt even a place for standing
1980810 when he was abseiling down one of the guys made a big technical mistake and he fell when you abseil you must take two ropes and he only took one rope the helicopter came but it was too late he fell a lot of metres he had no chance
1980811 they saw their friend falling from the top to the bottom they could do nothing because when he was falling it was too late
1980812 from what his mother told me he went hiking on a particular route
1980813 hes been hiking before there was no evidence of stress or strange behaviour there was no family row she seemed quite composed but obviously extremely worried
1980814 i think his whole life is teaching he does extra curricular work outside school hours for the school and spends his time at hyde united or watching sport
1980815 i dont want to speculate but i know of no reason why he would disappear so you are fearful theres been an accident if thats the case you would have a rough idea where hes been walking it shouldnt be that difficult to find him but they havent
1980816 she looked beautiful her dress is gorgeous the ring is gorgeous they cant be happier
1980817 is comforting because im able to do the things i was raised with like riding horses and doing branding
1980818 im able to do the things i was raised with like riding horses and doing branding and drinking livestock semen
1980819 when beijing was awarded the games seven years ago the theory was that international scrutiny would force chinas government to grant more rights and freedom to its people instead the olympics have opened up a backdoor for the regime to massively upgrade its systems of population control and repression

1980826 war started today in south ossetia when georgia attacked russian peacekeepers in the disputed region
1980827 if its not war then we are very close to it the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
1980828 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
1980829 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight

1980832 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
1980833 most of south ossetias territory is liberated and is controlled by georgia
1980834 i want to acknowledge that several hours ago i as a supreme commander have issued a very painful order not to return fire in response to a very intensive shelling of georgian villages
1980835 despite our call for peace and a unilateral ceasefire separatists continued the shelling of georgian villages
1980836 we are forced to restore constitutional order in the whole region
1980837 the actions by georgia in south ossetia bear witness to the fact that the leadership of that country can no longer be trusted
1980838 the quality of the visitor is more important than the volume
1980839 the design of that building is excellent and we should be grateful to have it
1980840 it would be a shame for a building like that to be torn down for a cookie cutter type building like cvs
1980841 i guess thats life as usual in the big city of sarasota
1980842 he hoped the building would make an important architectural statement
1980843 they dont own the property they are just wondering if they can develop it this isnt even approved by cvs yet
1980844 when cvs goes into urban areas they remodel buildings all the time
1980845 scholars of this material generally subscribe that the use of a system of module and mass production accounts for the diversity the phrase was coined by the german art historian lothar ledderose in 2000 when he used it as the subtitle of his book which had an image of the terracotta army on its cover and contained a compelling thesis about the distinctive nature of creativity in china most commentators have picked up on the mass produced nature of the figures a display case in the exhibition shows a modern reconstruction in little clay figures of the production line it is modelled in the style of the socialist realist sculpture that was used in maos day to generate such vast agitprop dioramas of life size figures as rent collection courtyard portraying the ways of pre 1949 evil landlords or wrath of the serfs portraying the evil ways of the pre 1949 tibetan monastic establishment the point is not just mass production but the mass production of modular forms three types of plinth two types of leg set eight types of torso and so on which can be combined and recombined and combined again into a simulacrum of diversity this is not so much mass production in the sense of the industrial revolution as in the sense in which it is deployed by starbucks where everyone can think they are getting just what they want

1980853 the me prices bode well for strong launches of future extensions like web and blog but most new extensions will be at best marginal successes especially given that google is not likely to trust most of them
1980854 this is a way for people to cling on to a part of the life they once had
1980855 but shes the one thats sort of carried on the family tradition
1980856 which isnt obvious until you go back and remember padm and her role she was a queen she was a leader she was the one that was motivating others shes the one that finds anakin so its actually padm and leia who are kind of the instigators of this whole thing even though its told from anakin and lukes point of view while its really anakins fall to the dark side and lukes redeeming him that becomes the dramatic story the bulwark foundation of the whole thing is padm and leia they have the political plot problem to overcome which is how to lead the rebellion how to bring freedom to the galaxy all those sorts of things theyre the ones doing that
1980857 no in this one her job is to mellow anakin down a bit so that he becomes more mature the easiest way for anakin to become a partner with obi wan and make it so that they become a team was to make him either a parent or a teacher so that he becomes more responsible and so thats how ahsoka got to be there and in searching for somebody shaak ti was sort of a favorite character of everybodys but we never really got to do anything with her since she got cut out of the movies shes there kind of in the background but the idea of a young shaak ti type person was appealing to me as a great idea for a character so she sort of evolved out of a lot of areas
1980858 its always been an important theme the idea of a master and apprentice
1980859 of course the first thing fans jump to is what the heck happened to her since shes not in revenge of the sith were going to reveal that over time but until then were going to be telling her story whats nice is we learn a lot about anakin by learning about her shes really going to challenge anakin in his issues with attachment that eventually will bring him down to darth vader

1980876 canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession

1980882 the arbitrator emphasized that he found a contradiction as to who initiated the sexual encounter which could not be resolved because the patient did not testify
1980883 as the applicable regulations make plain and as should be immediately obvious the question of who initiated the encounter has no bearing at all on whether baldwin violated the regulations

1980892 what is happening here of course reflects one of the largest of the blind spots of contemporary economics the assumption that market transactions mediated by money are the only significant form of economic activity
1980893 as a result it is automatically subversive to make ones own jam or butter or shoes

1981027 its part of a tolerant society it ties to everything from turbans to pierced eyebrows to peoples choices that they make and this one is even in a separate category because theres so much that shows it has such benefits far reaching benefits
1981028 were a huge economic force they say most of the buying decisions are made by mothers
1981029 our policy is to allow breastfeeding anywhere in our stores wherever the customer chooses
1981030 as part of our policy we do offer the customer if they prefer the opportunity to go into a more private location which would be a sitting room if they prefer they can also have a seat or a stool to sit on that makes it easier to breastfeed in our stores

1981035 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
1981036 we think in most of these systems it was a turbulent and chaotic process with planets getting into each others personal space and elbowing each other
1981037 a nice peaceful and polite and well behaved planetary system like our own only happens more rarely
1981038 there are some where we see one gas giant after another forming and cruising into the star almost like a convoy it is probably good that didnt happen in our solar system

1981045 we are a dry state and a dry continent and we will bring out a long term policy on water but it will not include a canal
1981046 i knew it would be a big issue i didnt anticipate it would be the dominant issue of that election
1981047 i made a mistake in the way it was introduced and the way it was handled
1981048 the last election effectively became a referendum on the canal thats what happened and the people of wa voted against it
1981049 interestingly since then water has become probably the number one issue for australia

1981060 on the other hand there are no winners here he was not a nice guy
1981061 this was just a slight social interaction that i think he would have liked to see as a long term friendship and i didnt
1981062 he denied it but there was no question it was he
1981063 he was really good at snooping even in the 1980s
1981064 he knew quite a lot about me without me telling him
1981065 he knew my sons names and their years in school

1981069 she took sharon by the shoulders and pushed her out of the way sharon stumbled
1981070 she was demanding that attention be given to her immediately
1981071 sharon was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency
1981072 victoria osteen never attacked her never tried to get in the cockpit
1981073 the aggressor and the person who was out of control who flipped out was ms brown
1981074 they will say this is about money but that is the only remedy a jury can offer
1981075 its an exceptional case it could be that it just slipped through the cracks
1981076 when the investigation began to focus on dr ivins the lab was notified of our concerns about him

1981080 if a supervisor observes that an employee is under a great deal of stress seems unusually distracted or is exhibiting other signs of strain the employees entry privileges can be temporarily suspended until the situation is resolved
1981081 i think there is a danger in assuming that if this is the guy weve solved the problem of vulnerability to anthrax and other pathogens
1981082 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars

1981086 are a chance for the rest of the world to discover what china really is
1981087 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china

1981093 we believe the proposed standard would lead to less accurate and less useful information for investors threatening the attorney client privilege and the attorney work product doctrine unnecessarily provide information to potential claimants and force corporate defendants to disclose privileged information to plaintiffs thereby jeopardizing their ability to defend the litigation

1981095 the design and marketing methods used to inculcate doctrine and guarantee consumption are fundamentally similar
1981096 that mao with his mona lisa smile and lenin with his proletarian cap functioned much the same way as trade characters like joe camel or the geico gecko putting a friendly face on an otherwise inanimate or sometimes inhumane product
1981097 considered themselves artists and eagerly participated in marketing their brands
1981098 modern corporate competitors these leaders borrowed freely from one another with hitler taking the straight armed roman salute from mussolini and mao adopting from the soviets
1981099 the nazis were the supreme masters of branding both at the figurative level in the vicious propaganda campaign he calls the branding demonization of the german jews and in a literal sense as the nazis resorted to the most degrading branding technique imaginable

1981110 there have been inaccurate reports published this week regarding layoffs at bittorrent inc we would like to clarify that bittorrent remains focused on generating the most value for our partners and customers to drive long term success while layoffs are always a difficult course of action we have reduced our staff to better align our resources around our core content delivery infrastructure business contrary to published reports we reduced less than 20 of our team and those impacted were distributed across our organization rather than focused on a single department
1981111 also contrary to published reports the layoffs were unrelated to any ongoing discussions to divest a portion of our business that claim is irresponsible journalism and outright false while it is our policy to not comment on rumors the company has indeed been involved in strategic discussions with potential partners who are interested in the bittorrent online store these discussions continue
1981112 with the explosive growth of online video peer to peer technology will continue to be an integral part of the internet infrastructure as it enables the most efficient distribution of large files not only is bittorrent the global leader in the p2p space with the largest client footprint but we are working closely with the world s leading isps including comcast and standards bodies such as the ietf to implement solutions that will provide the best p2p user experience to accommodate all network topologies
1981113 bittorrent is seeing healthy demand for its delivery network accelerator dna service and its software development kit sdk which brings rich internet media to the tv we are working with many online video gaming software and hardware companies to integrate bittorrent technology as such our top priority is to deliver the most valuable and efficient solutions to the bittorrent community and technology marketplace

1981130 we want the students to see that science and engineering are not intimidating but areas of endeavor where if youre motivated you can do things that not only help you learn but also make an impact
1981131 at the same time i think we can inspire them to achieve their academic dreams and life goals without feeling constrained by their refugee status or financial resources
1981132 we try to break down the explanations and definitions as much as possible
1981133 ive been really impressed with all of the students and their willingness and eagerness to learn and participate
1981134 without this partnership these kids would never have the opportunity to see touch and feel this type of equipment
1981135 and in a regular science class students dont have the opportunity to learn from true scientists now the students are learning how science is used in everyday life theyre also able to see the diversity of the princeton students and faculty which gives them role models they can identify with in terms of gender age and ethnicity
1981136 but now im working with scientists from princeton when i see african scientists doing well here i want to work like them and be like them
1981137 the road to college former refugees discuss their journeys to princeton and share tips on how to get to college

1981140 children are at the vanguard of the social networking phenomenon
1981141 what you find with young people is that they tend to be a lot looser with their personal information than more canny older people
1981142 that can be ok if they are in a fairly tightly controlled environment but when they are in an environment where theyre mixing with people much older than them then thats something to be quite cautious about
1981143 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1981144 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1981145 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1981146 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1981147 having that specific example made it easy to find more people
1981148 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1981149 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1981150 we really were surprised at the level of trust we found we didnt think wed be as successful as we were
1981151 any one of these people would have happily clicked on a malware site or viewed our profile with a data stealing trojan application

1981158 in my almost 20 years first as a prosecutor and now as an attorney general i cannot recall ever seeing let alone hearing of a situation where a police officer trying to serve a subpoena was assaulted
1981159 our second quarter results reflect the benefits of sales mix continued cost control and savings resulting from our global savings program initiatives these results were achieved in spite of dramatic vehicle production declines in the u s market which we were able to offset with stronger hybrid and heavy duty market sales
1981160 while we are pleased with ebitdar growth and profit improvement in operations we face challenging market conditions and earnings pressure for the rest of 2008 due to continued high raw material costs unfavorable currency rates and the downturn in north american automotive sales
1981161 there are a shared set of goals in this plan but the devil is in the details and the details are all over the map
1981162 we think this plan is not quite soup yet and we expect to make some major amendments at the board of supervisors
1981163 the board will scrutinize this but we can show them what can feasibly be done
1981164 we wouldnt have somebody come in and go okay play slither play fall to pieces
1981165 while many may have been legitimately lost it seems probable that quite a few are either stolen or reported stolen in order to sell them
1981166 there appears to be a healthy market for both buying and renting laser visas on the border
1981167 no thats okay i am taking a break from reading
1981168 im reading a really bad book and i need a break
1981169 this is not the same brushed look you see on mass produced products it is actually a ceramic clearcoat that brings out alot of depth in the metal you can only do a finish like this on a true forged wheel the effect is very dynamic in different light and a little hard to capture on camera
1981170 these wheel makers use a forged blank or center then use a cnc machine to cut out a pattern cutting the blank eliminates many of the strength benefits of forging our wheel is a true forged wheel and comes out of the forge already with renntechs signature 10 spoke design
1981171 our goal is to establish a mutually rewarding supply agreement with chrysler moving forward
1981172 however dana is prepared to exercise its right to discontinue supplying chrysler effective january 1 2009 if we continue to be unsuccessful in engaging them to address this goal in a meaningful way
1981173 while we sincerely hope that this will not be the case we have informed chrysler of our intentions in order to provide both companies with the time to consider their options for ongoing sourcing of the programs we currently support
1981174 while this is an isolated case it serves to illustrate our commitment to pursue only market competitive business opportunities moving forward
1981175 its far too early and inappropriate to speculate on potential outcomes at a facility level
1981176 to be clear our focus remains on achieving a market competitive agreement with chrysler moving forward
1981177 the impact of rising fuel costs and a weak economy began to affect commercial travel volumes in the second quarter leisure traffic was less affected as softer transaction volume was more than offset by longer length of rental enplanements declined sequentially throughout the quarter this combined with lower than expected time and mileage rates per day made the second quarter a challenging operating environment
1981178 however we maintained our revenue growth momentum adjusted our fleet levels appropriately during the quarter and continued to achieve solid results in our sales of used vehicles
1981179 more importantly we continued to make significant progress in our performance excellence process improvement initiative in ancillary revenue growth and in increasing our off airport presence in addition we have seen tighter industry wide fleet levels thus far in the third quarter combined with year over year pricing gains transaction volume however continues to reflect a slowdown in the travel environment
1981180 as a result we remain cautious in our outlook for the seasonally slower fourth quarter for commercial travel volumes and for the pricing environment and are aggressively responding to the expectation of a soft travel climate we are decreasing field and corporate staffing levels adjusting the size and composition of our fleet to better match anticipated demand reducing compensation costs and significantly curtailing discretionary spending in addition we are exploring additional opportunities among our revenue streams costs and business mix to improve profitability these steps will not only better position us to weather an anticipated weaker environment but should also add additional coverage under the financial ratios included in our credit facilities
1981181 in the second quarter we realized the benefits of our geographic and customer diversification efforts
1981182 despite the challenging north american operating environment which was exacerbated by the uaw strike of american axle in april and may we were still able to deliver solid earnings in the second quarter due to the strong performance of our overseas operations
1981183 given the drastic reduction in north american light vehicle production management across the company focused on cost reductions managing capital spending and reducing working capital the results of these efforts are demonstrated by our strong free cash flow figures for the second quarter
1981184 despite the headwinds of the north american light vehicle production environment we delivered strong results in the second quarter the cost savings initiatives and working capital discipline we implemented in the past six months will make the company much stronger when economic conditions provide for a better operating environment that being said there is still significant uncertainty regarding short term economic conditions and fuel prices and their impact on global light vehicle production given this uncertainty we are choosing not to update our previous full year 2008 guidance that we will be profitable for the full year

1981203 we unreservedly apologise both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy

1981209 theyre trying to get me down because im a football player
1981210 all they see is a black guy with dreads that makes me a thug
1981211 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
1981212 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
1981213 people want to sell on anything or buy on anything
1981214 strengthening in the dollar is a good thing not only for business but also to build back confidence both domestically and internationally
1981215 this is the first time technology has been used to help manage risk and predict growth for early stage companies
1981216 for more established companies quantitative systematic decision making for investors is standard using technology driven credit rating services such as moodys and standard amp poors but until now no similar system has existed for companies in their earliest stages

1981223 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
1981224 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
1981225 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
1981226 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come
1981227 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1981228 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
1981229 weve had these back and forths with china for years
1981230 im not making any predictions about medal counts but i can tell you the u s athletes are ready to come and compete in the spirit of friendship
1981231 you can fool some of the people all the time and those are the ones you want to concentrate on
1981232 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
1981233 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
1981234 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
1981235 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
1981236 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
1981237 blood shed in south ossetia will weigh on their conscience
1981238 i dont know what could be given or presented to these innocent people who were killed in the us
1981239 i personally present my apologies to them if anything what i did have caused them pain
1981240 it is not clear that the length of sentence is all that meaningful to mr hamdan it is not as though whenever his sentence has been served he is going to be leaving there
1981241 to the extent you go to the trouble of looking at specific offenses committed by a particular enemy combatant you adjudicate you prosecute and you obtain the result then you have to live with the consequences
1981242 whatever the sentence is once he has finished serving it he should be released
1981243 the overriding problem is that the bush administration has said that hamdan will be held until the war on terror is over regardless of what sentence he gets
1981244 it is almost kafkaesque that regardless of what the sentence might be and whatever credit he is given for his prior detention they are saying they are going to hold him until the war ends and everyone knows that is virtually limitless
1981245 i want to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me
1981246 i hope the day comes that you return to your wife and daughters and your country and youre able to be a provider a father and a husband in the best sense of all those terms
1981247 slight but statistically significant margin 22 percent to 16 percent people say that recently they have a less rather than more favorable view of obama
1981248 most folks are paying attention with only one ear at most
1981249 but still you can establish a theme at this point that builds through the convention what mccain has done is hes blunted obamas momentum coming home from europe and reestablished the sense that you dont know much about this guy
1981250 the fact that 1 million people watched the video with paris hilton and britney spears i wouldnt regard that as a signal of anything other than that they are objects of fascination
1981251 the reality is that barack obamas credentials are thin the public believes that negative campaigning has the best chance of succeeding when its aimed at real vulnerability rather than trying to make up an image out of whole cloth
1981252 theyre going for the 15 to 20 percent who arent paying much attention and are still going to vote and figure they can knock obama down now and identify him early before the convention
1981253 but theres a lot of evidence i think that this trivializes mccain hes supposed to be an experienced serious guy here
1981254 it was probably one of the better weeks for mccain
1981255 this is one of those things where they threw something against the wall and it happened to stick
1981256 but the problem is when you have things that are reactive or spur of the moment and they are not tied to a unified theme its kind of tough to move to the next thing
1981257 for most countries in southeast asia though some say it more openly than others the us is the most important security partner in the region the key balancer in the region and they wont want to see any lessening of that role
1981258 there is a general view that american influence in asia is declining and both sides of the pacific suggest that the next administration needs to focus on a strong us presence in asia and to convey its commitment clearly
1981259 both bush and clinton when they came in tended to be hard liners vis vis china and critical of the preceding administration for being too soft on china then they would have a better and more civil relationship

1981267 while this workshop suggested modifications that could be made to the casino site plan designs that would contribute to the civic vision there remains too many outstanding design factors including large garages mega block building footprints and blank walls that cannot be overcome based on the american slot parlor casino business model
1981268 these challenges lead to a conclusion that casinos of this program type do not work on these sites and by extension would be better sited elsewhere

1981280 every american should be offended and outraged by comparisons between our dedicated public servants risking their lives every day to enforce our immigration laws and the nazi secret police no matter who is making the comparison that such a vile statement was made by a member of congress is truly reprehensible and irresponsible
1981281 ice actions have been entirely legitimate and carried out in a professional manner in an effort to deal with a national illegal immigration crisis
1981282 such a reckless comparison to the gestapo borders in making such comparisons congressman gutierrez is providing license for people to resist by any means necessary
1981283 fair joins with dhs assistant secretary julie myers in demanding that the house leadership take action against representative gutierrez his statement deserves the strongest possible condemnation from his colleagues

1981305 it is time for pakistan to categorically state enough of pakistan bashing enough of vacuous kantian moralizing in a hobbesian world enough of the do more mantra and enough of partisan analysis enough of selective perceptions enough of double standards
1981306 no matter what anyones gdp gross domestic product may be or their nuclear arsenal we are in this mess together that is the message of the spreading militancy the region will unravel if the governments in the area and those involved outsiders like washington do not make it a common cause to jointly work to address the causes of growing militancy the answer lies in a regional solution
1981307 if you want to talk about that youre more than happy to talk to our press officer but no im not
1981308 eesi is glad to see that epa denied the waiver it is reassuring that epas analysis confirmed what many universities and experts have been staying which is that the rfs was not causing severe harm to the us or the texas economy
1981309 without a doubt our federal approach to transportation is broken and no amount of tweaking adjusting or adding new layers on top will make things better

1981312 hope for your home is a reflection of the change in the real estate market
1981313 some people would love to refinance but their home and their credit wont allow them to
1981314 as we say plants on the outside paint on the inside a lot of these homes need decluttering and revamping so you can reveal the home in its best light
1981315 sellers will continue to do the types of renovations these tv shows feature in an effort to raise the value of their house and its curb appeal
1981316 not surprising that the preponderance of tv shows about real estate have had to change their focus to reflect the current housing market
1981317 about 10 months ago we could see the foreclosure crisis starting and thought that this could be a cutting edge show for our audience
1981318 this may be a show with a much broader appeal because of where the market has gone
1981319 people are so traumatized by the market that they are staying put unless some major life change happens like a job transfer or a divorce
1981320 given the housing market and the economy theyre looking to further the enjoyment of their current home while at the same time doing things that are not going to decrease its value
1981321 its sad to say that in some cases were just postponing the inevitable
1981322 its a reality check for the families who dont step up
1981323 some americans have loans they shouldnt have qualified for in the first place like oprah says sometimes people need to see other people going through the same thing on tv before they have that aha moment and decide that its better to step out of the market move into a rental
1981324 they had erased the previous directories probably because they didnt have room to keep it
1981325 in the case of coreflood youve got people infected who didnt do anything wrong
1981326 if youre not an expert you probably shouldnt be online doing financial transactions
1981327 i am very worried about anybody using windows and banking online
1981328 it is likely they are looking for the larger accounts
1981329 you may not see any activity on an account for months
1981330 they just dont have the time to go through it all
1981331 the relationships are not as good as they need to be to have effective action taken
1981332 the people in law enforcement tell me that to get anything done they have to go through diplomatic channels
1981333 there has to be political pressure brought to bear it has to be a priority
1981334 we think there might be a better chance of getting these guys because of who they have infected
1981335 the feedback we are hearing is that the incremental updates to the software dont merit a new product every year
1981336 given this we have decided against releasing a 2009 version of money plus
1981337 in response to our retail partners needs consumer behavior and business efficiencies microsoft is focusing distribution efforts for microsoft money plus software online via download and discontinuing traditional box sales of the software at retail
1981338 microsoft money plus will continue to be available at retail outlets while supplies last we have stopped shipping new product to retail outlets
1981339 more people are now using connected online services versus desktop software so that part of microsofts decision makes sense because of the overall shift to online
1981340 we constantly talk to our customers and see how they use the product so when we put out an update its about making quicken better and meeting customer needs as long as we have customers asking for changes or new features well continue to do updates
1981341 will microsoft offer some service offering to extend online services will microsoft continue support will microsoft continue updates for things like tax law changes
1981342 the soc is to get a few sets of cardiac enzymes on these patients and to perform a stress test if either is positive the patient may be considered for cardiac catheterization
1981343 at nearly every age level women are less likely to have coronary artery disease than men they are more likely to be found to have normal coronaries on cardiac ct and therefore more likely to be discharged since they are discharged costs go down
1981344 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
1981345 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
1981346 i think the day may come when this technology is regularly used to triage patients that would otherwise end up waiting for hours in the emergency department for a stress test and another set of cardiac enzymes as physicians design protocols that further reduce the radiation dose associated with exams and as engineers design faster multislice cts the radiation dose the main major risk of the procedure will fall
1981347 coronary ct angiography is more efficient than a stress test in the identification of coronary artery disease
1981348 my mother called me herself and said youre a liberal from new england what the f are you doing in oklahoma shooting things

1981381 bruce ivins is a name i dont recall ever hearing before but im told his name appears in several articles on this site
1981382 the fbi certainly has a better case against ivins than ive seen against anyone else
1981383 the first pictures i saw of him when he didnt have any glasses on didnt look anything like him
1981384 but the pictures after he was apprehended with the glasses those look just like him
1981385 we have been informed about the case by the u s authorities and we are checking possible connections to germany at the moment
1981386 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
1981387 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
1981388 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
1981389 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
1981390 he claimed to be a german student and i think he had already finished
1981391 we just figured out everything was not what it was
1981392 hes not in the yearbook theres no record of him theres no footprint of him but he was there
1981393 some of these conditions include reduced wind shear weaker trade winds an active west african monsoon system the winds coming off of africa and warmer than average water in the atlantic ocean
1981394 typically when you have strong activity during july thats also a very strong indicator the remainder of the season will be above normal
1981395 couldnt have done better and that will remain my satisfaction even if i lose
1981396 the opponents are all of a high level you dont reach the olympics if you arent but it ultimately boils down to how they shoot on a particular day as for me i remain the perennial underdog
1981397 but come on its the olympics i have to try and give it my best dont i
1981398 his motivation in doing it was to play the futures market so that after the pipeline blew up and the price of oil increased he could make whatever profit on it
1981399 that shows at least in his mind that it was going to be a significant enough impact to affect the financial markets in a way that he would enrich himself
1981400 on its face it sounds like an extremely serious charge on the other hand the only person who had the capability of carrying out this scheme was a convicted felon government informant working with atf
1981401 all of the activity in the united states was to be carried out by the government informant and all of this happened with the governments knowledge
1981402 things happen in your life that you draw on later
1981403 ive wondered and come to a pretty rough conclusion this administration wanted us to see the glory of war and not the cost of war
1981404 the clinic the president has said its on his priority list but he has not put one dollar into his budget proposals

1981409 democratic presidential candidate barack obama pledged to free the united states from dependence on oil from the middle east and venezuela within a decade

1981411 pima countys library system is one of a dozen in the country participating in a study to find out if video games improve literacy
1981412 luis aguilar 11 helped organize a video game club in the process he learned filmmaking skills to create a five minute movie about it luis believes the games are making him smarter because it helps you with memory memorizing stuff and hand eye coordination
1981413 if national research verifies these kids experiences the american library association would like to create a video game curriculum for all libraries to use
1981414 yes it is true once teens come to library because of gaming they also find time to study to check out books most importantly they also find time to learn they learn about information technology they develop research skills that will serve their life long learning needs
1981415 gaming in libraries you bet with an investment of about 900 less than 1 tenth of 1 of budget we have over 3 000 new young adult library users
1981416 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain
1981417 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house
1981418 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
1981419 in this campaign weve seen people change their mind on so many subjects so many times this shows mccain is a longtime leader who puts his country over politics
1981420 one of the things people are tired of is the gridlock they are tired of the constant attacks back and forth
1981421 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt think of voting for the john mccain of 2008
1981422 the american people are learning that john mccain represents more of the same failed policies weve gotten from george bush for the past eight years
1981423 hes one of the people we modeled our campaign over because he is very direct very blunt and nobody has to guess at what hes thinking
1981424 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
1981425 hes a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes
1981426 if he was a maverick hes a maverick no more
1981427 if you look at his overall record he has a 98 percent conservative record
1981428 working across the aisle to get results for the american people

1981483 there needs to be a way for us to file complaints bring things to peoples attention there needs to be sort of a public window we can go up to in the house of representatives and say we think you ought to look at this or this is serious and we want to file a complaint so against that youve got to balance the constitutional requirements of the conduct of congress which means youve got speech and debate and the other protections that no one other than presumably the members are supposed to deal with the conduct of members

1981485 i think the sonic next gen experience in terms of quality that was relatively early in the next gen cycle when lots of developers were just coming to grips with the technology
1981486 this time around with sonic unleashed we got a great new engine the hedgehog engine and that allows us to truly deliver the sonic experience as it arguably should have been on the next gen you know blending classic 2d gameplay with 3d beautiful landscapes rich environments then with a nice innovative twist were taking sonic in a different direction slow him down and he transforms into a werehog and that changes the gameplay again for fans of sonic that have been looking for a next gen experience this is the game theyve been waiting for

1981565 the sermon was decent but why do so many pastors tell a story where a promising professional decides to enter the ministry mission field or nonprofit sector as a great sacrifice arent they stating that other careers are less noble or even less godly i think its weird and the wrong message

1981588 this research is based on 20 years of satellite observations and we found a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature
1981589 this means that heavy rain events are likely to increase during warm periods and decrease during cold periods
1981590 its possible its being felt already today but its quite difficult to separate out the influence of global warming from the normal day to day fluctuations
1981591 there is a major concern that heavy rainstorms will become more common and more intense in a warmer climate floods can completely devastate areas and peoples livelihoods so this knowledge could have massive implications on how we plan for our changing climate in the future

1981593 the band e timor area was a logistics hub that fed everything from fighters to supplies to money into helmand and kandahar
1981594 the materials were in band e timor to allow them to assemble bombs and ship them west or east into helmand to attack brits or into kandahar to attack the city or canadians
1981595 disruption was the main goal that was achieved we know that given the nature with which we came in to band e timor we took them by surprise
1981596 anybody that didnt escape from the area has had to essentially abandon their weapon hide their weapon and blend in with the locals
1981597 the intent was for them to get used to operations in kandahar and there is some consideration towards the use of american forces within the province

1981621 we carefully examined the case and agreed that the first half of oso was similar to mongas script but it was not a straight lift since that does not imply a copyright infringement we did not entertain the matter
1981622 my client is ready to take this matter up to the supreme court besides the first half which is a complete lift from mongas script the latter half of the movie is plagiarised from the cult movie

1981647 im a platonist a follower of plato who believes that one didnt invent these sorts of things that one discovers them
1981648 every event is caused by something that happened before it
1981649 every event is caused by a prior event except the first event
1981650 every non negative integer is greater than at least one other non negative integer except zero
1981651 the universe beings in a state of minimum entropy and evolves toward a state of maximum entropy
1981652 fluctuations can produce low entropy states which then evolve toward higher entropy
1981653 since we dont know a what a universe actually is in any meaningful way and b how a universe might actually come to be one cannot state
1981654 gt gt if theres only one universe namely this one and if it had a beginning it doesnt have the reason for its existence contained within it kant dispelled this ontological argument pretty well btw
1981655 heres the simple truth of the matter the universe may have had a beginning it may not have we dont yet know but not knowing in no way shape or form indicates that theists are right when they claim that god did it
1981656 this could be verified in a few different ways if we had such a multiverse theory that gave very specific predictions about what we should see in our own universe independent of any others then we could use that to test the theory another way of looking at it is that if we tested and verified a theory about how physics behaves in our own universe that makes clear unambiguous predictions as to the properties of the multiverse then again wed have strong evidence of a multiverse
1981657 why do you think that either of these are necessary the existence of the equations themselves might well be enough for a universe described by them to exist
1981658 as for kant his basic argument revolved around the idea that
1981659 the problem with the terminology you use is that it relates to
1981660 ah but what created them and what created the ones before them etc
1981661 again faith is irrelevant to the idea of multiple universes they are either there in which case they will be proven to be there or they are not in which case they wont
1981662 i gave the multiple universes example as one idea there are also others that can
1981663 i could write some entertaining sf stories about them in the meantime
1981664 the zero sum game makes perfect sense in the absence of other universes if the universe is as a whole a zero sum equation then it is bound to occur according to qm
1981665 your assertion that energy is just some system invented by humans to track change i think you should refine your definition of energy energy is a real thing independent of
1981666 whether you want to believe in god or not its a bad idea to base your belief in god on an urge to explain features of the natural world including its creation and existence because eventually science will get there and take care of that stuff and then where are you
1981667 we seek an understanding of the laws of nature and of our particular universe in which everything makes sense to us
1981668 eventually science will get there and take care of that stuff
1981669 if the total sum of the universe over time is zero then it required nothing to create it the same way as virtual particles can be envisoned as pairs of particles and antiparticles instantaneously annihilating one another are
1981670 if the total sum of the universe over time is zero
1981671 also your assertion that qm does not exist beyond or in the absence of the universe does not necessarily make sense either it remains to be seen if that is the case and if qm can provide a framework to describe the creation of this niverse then that would demonstrate that qm pertains independently of it
1981672 ah yes but what if the specific features of the theory that lead to the unambiguous prediction of the multiverse are verified
1981673 well im pretty sure that what really exists are mathematical structures and that what we perceive as a physical world is not something separate from a mathematical world this is pretty much the picture proposed by tegmark i m o this should be the default hypothesis in physics but for some strange reason it isnt
1981674 we seek an understanding of the laws of nature and of our particular universe in which everything makes sense to us
1981675 positing a low entropy boundary condition is not really very simple or compact its a separate law of nature
1981676 and you have to posit that the ordinary laws of quantum mechanics which do not include a boundary in time somehow fail in this case
1981677 whether you want to believe in god or not its a bad idea to base your belief in god on an urge to explain features of the natural world including its creation and existence
1981678 there is empirical knowledge gained from observation and experimentation there is logical knowlege derived from the rules of math and then there is values knowlege based on what we choose to believe only a fool confuses them
1981679 he who surveys it from the highest regions perhaps he knows it or perhaps even he knows not
1981680 dimensional issues to the relevance of how we see the universe

1981682 i am starting to think that people are really sleeping on the bears
1981683 what role does god or your faith play in helping you get through tough financial times
1981684 there is a great effort to maintain the old consciousness and resistance to the new consciousness
1981685 michael tsarion on consciousness and future of the human race
1981686 it also validates if validation was needed that clinging to religion is a very real phenomenon one that has its own dignity and worth
1981687 if i am being asked what sustains me in economic hard times my answer isnt conventional religious piety but a new vision of possibilities such a vision must be spiritual at its core
1981688 give the poorest people and everyone else the tools to expand their own awareness and heartless questions about how it feels to be poor wont be necessary anymore

1981691 are you surprised by the turnout in the united states
1981692 to prevent this there is a need to mobilize history is not made by extraordinary figures but by ordinary people who can move mountains when they believe in a cause and get organized it has happened all over the world and it has happened in the u s we saw it in the establishment of the new deal social security unemployment insurance job creation minimum wage and subsidized housing among other programs these were not just the outcome of president roosevelts position but the result of huge social agitation and mobilization as usually happens in historical moments of societal change government leaders were not so much leading as trying to catch up with what millions of people were demanding similarly the great society programs medicare medicaid environmental protection agency niosh osha and many other examples of progressive legislation were the outcome of massive mobilizations candidate john kennedys proposals for change were rather moderate and his domestic policies once he was elected were also disappointing but the mobilization triggered by his election was followed by many more such as appalachian coal miners strikes against their working conditions the splendid civil rights movement led by martin luther king and the ant vietnam war movement led by student groups they all established a political climate in which progressive legislation could occur history indeed does not repeat itself but it offers us pointers on where to go and it should be obvious that change will not occur unless there is a huge mobilization to complete the unfinished agenda of civil rights a full development of social rights with the human right to access to health care at the center
1981693 people equate time to money i dont know if you saw this video of deepak sharing about time and the person with the lightest suitcase travels the swiftest we are one non duel breath rich or poor it is the tao to know the sweet you have to know the bitter after that it is a state of attitude love patty
1981694 who do you feel should be the one or ones to provide these tools to the poor
1981695 hence my assertion that most of the spiritual path is plainly psychological those who advertise their services as gurus would do well by themselves and their students if they were trained in one of the therapeutic modalities those gurus who ignore eschew or are ignorant of the psychological do so at the peril of their students and quite possibly of their indemnity as untrained counselors

1981697 those gurus who ignore eschew or are ignorant of the psychological do so at the peril of their students and quite possibly of their indemnity as untrained counselors
1981698 in the 21st century terrorists and criminals increasingly use laptops and other electronic media to transport illicit materials that were traditionally
1981699 we must adapt to 21st century risks and anticipate rather than react to new threats
1981700 according to the huffington post its being reported that barack obama may name indiana senator evan bayh as his vice presidential running mate tomorrow tomorrow thats what heres what we know about evan bayh he was going to run for president then he dropped out after getting less than 2 of the vote less that 2 he was actually losing to low fat milk
1981701 barack obama now says he is open to offshore oil drilling so apparently when he promised change he was talking about his mind

1981705 bush of course also holds the record for most presidential vacation days 506 and counting you know between that and the travel days i think its clear there is something about being at the white house our president cannot stand on screen stewart imitating bush i cant help but think that im sleeping in the same bed where my mom and dad used to do it that is disturbing on many different levels
1981706 they say john mccain is 71 but people are saying he may be older no one knows for sure because his birth certificate was destroyed when the wagon train was attacked
1981707 you ever notice that congress doesnt even call it a vacation you know what they call it a recess you ever notice the only people that get recess are congress kindergarten and juries those are the only three
1981708 1191 behind him i thought it was his birth date
1981709 vice president dick cheney is in baghdad while he was in iraq he said that its a successful endeavor at least i think thats what he said it was hard to hear over the explosions
1981710 john mccain and barack obama have both laid out their energy plans obama wants enough green energy to power the entire u s economy and mccain just wants enough power to keep his energy friends in the green

1981722 the song was a hit and the words lynch and racism has never come up until this moron wrote this blog
1981723 colberts studio audience clapped to the beat blithely unaware that they were swaying to a racially tinged explicitly pro lynching anthem that calls for the vigilante style hanging of car thieves and other assorted evildoers
1981724 grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son a man had to answer for the wicked that hed done take all the rope in texas find a tall oak tree round up all of them bad boys hang them high in the street
1981725 during the days when keiths grandpappy stalked the jim crow south lynching was an institutional method of terror employed against blacks to maintain white supremacy
1981726 its about the old west and horses and sheriffs and going and getting the bad guys its not a racist thing or about lynching
1981727 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008
1981728 i especially got into their promotion of teaching women about safe sex and about not being afraid to carry condoms
1981729 one of the things i tell them is most men are just going to be really happy to be there in the first place so dont be afraid to insist on safe sex every time
1981730 i had such a good time and the directors made me feel so comfortable
1981731 it was nerve racking but i did it and i want to do more acting i do want to be taken seriously as an actress
1981732 celebrity endorsements of politicians really dont mean much having campaigned for al gore and for john kerry i think that the only job that an entertainer may have is to attract media or attract people to a speaking engagement for said politician
1981733 i dont think celebrities impact people and nor should they
1981734 i have my political views but i dont think its important to share

1981739 explanation of what problems were identified and give the applicant a chance to respond to that
1981740 vendors need to name their products theres no question about that and theres unfortunately product specific taxonomy but broad terms like cloud computing those are canvasses that we should all be able to paint our piece of the mural on
1981741 the application was to protect the use of the term cloud computing as it relates specifically to our offering
1981742 at the time when we announced our solution it was not quite as pervasive a term we sought to protect our intellectual property and we certainly respect the intellectual property of other people and would not infringe on that of others

1981752 quality has taken a complete backseat if it even gets in the car at all
1981753 we had two scoreboards that had been there for some time and the 16 000 light bulbs of which they consisted needed constant replacement
1981754 we also had a temporary video screen which was brought in for major matches so when we decided to replace the two scoreboards the decision was made to add a third and set them all up to be capable of showing video
1981755 but its part of an on going policy of upgrading our facility to ensure that lords continues to be the best cricket ground in the world
1981756 when we first displayed white text on a black background which is how a traditional scoreboard would look the lighthouse screens provided more contrast than those of its competitors
1981757 they provided better display quality when used as scoreboards and for showing video this was the major consideration in awarding the contract to lighthouse technologies
1981758 this was a significant undertaking for lighthouse and we have gained a vast amount of experience from our main contractor status
1981759 but we were wholly confident in our ability to remove the two old scoreboards and their support structures install a new 20 meter high mast and to supply the three screens
1981760 its not about my lack of care i dont want to join counsel for gerber who said all 48 million citizens are slaughtered in their doors but i accept theres a crisis

1981781 the first aspect of my speech is what most of us are here gathered for is this country fair to the niger delta people
1981782 there is another law that is called the exclusive economic zone act
1981783 let me take you to the most important aspect to me
1981784 the first thing to say is that in baghdad you know what the war is about dont you it is a religious war between the shiites and the sunnis in rivers state in bayelsa and other parts of the niger delta who is fighting whom what is the war about
1981785 the way to define criminality is that anybody who breaks the laws of the federal republic of nigeria is a criminal the law says we shall not bear arms and so anybody who bears arms has committed a crime and so they are all criminals
1981786 the struggle for now because it does not exist because a struggle is ideological and there is no ideological bent to the struggle we are seeing
1981787 the first principle is self survival if nigeria has rejected me should i reject myself
1981788 we ask ourselves one basic question what are we voted here to do what is our responsibility
1981789 but the truth is that when it militancy started nobody thought it will get to this point
1981790 we must demand from our leaders accountability they must account not for the funds alone they must account for what they have turned our children into they must tell us why the next mans life is not as important as their own life they must when they started it it was just simple local government area matter chairman of council that they were struggling for and to publicly say that we have won an election today those local governments are not even in their hands anymore today they cannot go home today governors are demanding for more security in their convoys today legislators are demanding for more security from their governors today commissioners are demanding for security
1981791 that is where i differ i say my mind anywhere i go to worse can happen and i will tell you the truth these boys require force you know why they require force they are not ideological if the process today is ideological count me in
1981792 but i cannot back a criminal entity where people sit down and kidnap and do oil bunkering to the detriment of our economy and you say we will negotiate i am not part of the negotiation
1981793 when i was a speaker before i became governor i used to see some of them they tell me these are the people who are into this shooting and when they come they carry young girls they wear these jeans with half of their buttocks showing and they come with jeeps and imagine if n250 000 can buy them jeeps
1981794 then we the governors at that point we have a responsibility the responsibility we have is social rehabilitation
1981795 as a governor i have plans of what i want to do but as i am talking to you i cannot execute those things because i have security threats i have over a n100 billion resting in the bank resting
1981796 we are trying to find allies for our position especially among new member states its possible to form a blocking minority and we are working on this
1981797 the french eu presidency will try to close this topic so we need to be even more active in defending our cause which is economic development
1981798 the negotiations are ongoing we cant allow a situation in which we are forced to limit co2 emissions without being able to invest in our own energy security
1981799 a full fledged adjustment phase has begun for the euro
1981800 i was attracted to the in house scene from my early days in private practice there is a more holistic view when you understand the business through from start to finish you can really add value to the company
1981801 at the moment one of our main priorities is international growth
1981802 in order to grow we have to be strong in the international market and not just in the u s we are particularly focused on emerging markets such as russia india and china and recently recruited our first in house lawyer in moscow
1981803 boundaries are really breaking down in terms of different forms of digital delivery of media content the business models are changing now and we need to adjust our legal skills as business models develop
1981804 one of the major challenges to the business is internet based piracy it has hit the music industry very hard and is obviously a big issue for the film industry
1981805 however anti piracy initiatives are often controversial not least in the relationship between data protection and copyright enforcement
1981806 seventy five percent of the europe middle east and afria emea legal team sit with specific lines of business and are defacto dedicated there is a small central group but the vast majority of the group are responsible for specific business units regionally
1981807 the lawyers for areas of the business such as the disney channel for example are physically located with business units we deliberately avoid using a large centralised legal function it destroys the essential closeness to the business
1981808 worldwide business functions have close business relationships with lawyers in similar functions across the world it is important that information and knowledge is shared on a worldwide basis and not just in emea and that there is a high degree of coordination in the legal function
1981809 some specialist functions are run globally for example trademark issues because trademark registrations are determined on a global basis and also antitrust where we need a worldwide perspective we talk to each other and discuss issues consistently on a worldwide basis
1981810 we place a high value on strong technical ability we are a large legal department with a culture of legal excellence and newcomers have to be able to survive in that environment as well as speak the language of a media business
1981811 career development is always a challenge for in housers so we try to move people around we are in the process of transferring a lawyer in our madrid office to london and we recently transferred an american lawyer from japan to london
1981812 in our u k legal function we tend to only outsource specialized work
1981813 bread and butter business advice we do in house we act very much like a small firm
1981814 we outsource more outside of the u k across the european union and use a relatively large number of firms for special tasks we spread our instructions around i would describe it as horses for courses we tend to use individuals that we know
1981815 its easy to move from elite to non elite its not so easy to move from non elite to elite

1981817 i think selling off our assets that we probably could never purchase again would not be something i would like to see happen
1981818 i would like to think we would rebuild that art center that that painting along with the other great paintings will be hanging there for my grandkids to see just like i did and just like my children did
1981819 its almost impossible to say i dont think anything quite like that has been put on the market for a very long time
1981820 sell that painting and we can rebuild the entire flood devastated fine arts campus in iowa city without asking the public for a dime
1981821 there would be money left over to buy works of renowned iowa artists such as grant wood who actually attended the university of iowa unlike pollock who has no connection whatever to the tall corn state or unrecognized hawkeye artists
1981822 it was something id been aware of for some time
1981823 i would encourage the regents to become fully informed as to the paintings role at the university of iowa
1981824 there are dire ramifications for museums who get into this business of selling works to pay bills
1981825 im not proposing the painting be sold but im proposing we look to see that if the painting were sold how much it would bring
1981826 a few years ago christies or sothebys was asked about its value and it was enormous
1981827 this is one of the great marks of distinction the university of iowa has and one of the reasons it is described as having one the premier art collections in the world
1981828 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
1981829 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
1981830 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
1981831 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
1981832 hey this looks like a big zero or a vertical goatsee maybe wed better not
1981833 it is impossible to speak in such a way that you cannot be misunderstood
1981834 the hippies group is impressed by mr spock however who gestures with an oval symbol of peace the party makes with raised hands and speaks of the one
1981835 every time you think well this has got to be the bottom circle of the obama nut roasting inferno the ground just falls away below your feet and you know there are miles to fall
1981836 well hell i mean he looked like a terrrrrist right

1981844 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
1981845 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
1981846 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
1981847 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
1981848 weve had these back and forths with china for years
1981849 candor is most effective where nations have built a relationship of respect and trust
1981850 ive worked hard to build that respect and trust i appreciate the chinese leadership that have worked hard to build that respect and trust
1981851 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come

1981863 there have been problems with the torch but now is the time for the party
1981864 we have travelled to so many cities from olympia to the great wall we have cried so many times
1981865 it is very emotional especially when you see the reaction of the chinese crowds
1981866 not only are the chinese addressing the world but they are addressing 1 3 billion people in their own country and i think we will see the real china
1981867 i think this will mean a lot for the perception of china the rest of the world will find a country with 5 000 years of history a fascinating country i believe the spotlight on china will help the world to understand china and it will also help china to understand the world
1981868 it was not difficult to get through the security as we had been planning this for four years
1981869 we wanted to make a call to world leaders and the chinese government for meaningful change we knew there were risks but they were nothing compared to the suffering tibetans have endured
1981870 we are only a very small part of this campaign and the ongoing struggle well carry on fighting and there will be more protests during the olympics
1981871 the us believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1981872 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1981873 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
1981874 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1981875 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games

1981886 voc pode argumentar que ningu m est pronto para ser presidente

1981896 im shocked at the result i really didnt expect the computer to win in a one hour game
1981897 it would even be difficult with eight stones mogo played really well after getting a lead every time i played aggressively it just played safely even when it meant sacrificing some stones it didnt try to maximize the win and just played the most sure way to win its like a machine
1981898 how much time do we have left weve improved nine stones in just a year and i suspect the next nine will fall quickly now
1981899 no thats okay ill put them back in the spaghettio storage facility under the couch

1981903 i am not surprised at the acrimony its definitely a crucial election but the parties must first protect the peace
1981904 our main concern is that political parties are sponsoring minors to go and register so they can vote illegally come election day
1981905 leaves for another day the question of how and to whom the award should be distributed
1981906 perhaps it is not too much to hope that the announcement in this memorandum of a hard number will give rise to some off line conversation between the parties in the meantime
1981907 plaintiffs demonstrated willingness to accept data they liked and reject data they disliked did not enhance the credibility of their model
1981908 we believe we presented a strong compelling case that individual indian trust beneficiaries are entitled to much more than the governments admitted mismanagement of our trust monies over the past 120 years
1981909 the department is gratified that the court recognized the complexities and uncertainties involved in this case
1981910 is a dinosaur the morally and culturally oblivious hand me down of a disgracefully racist and imperialist government that should have been buried a century ago
1981911 the cobell case will no doubt stand in some respects as a cautionary tale about the limited ability of a court to right historical wrongs that could have been and should have been settled by the same political branches in recognition of their own failure to preserve the trust
1981912 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children

1981918 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
1981919 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
1981920 for so many of my supporters just like so many of baracks supporters this was a first time investment of heart and soul and money and effort and sleepless nights and miles of travel
1981921 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
1981922 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
1981923 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1981924 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
1981925 gee mr president id looooove to help you on that pet legislation of yours fax it to me and ill get back with you in six months after ive had time to read it

1981940 at the end of the day the georgians realise that time is not on their side and they could not let south ossetia and abkhazia become even more messy and russian influence even stronger
1981941 he has had plenty of warnings from the west that it wont pull any chestnuts out of the fire for him so i dont think he can count on the cavalry riding in
1981942 the russians hope he will get more than verbal support
1981943 the russians want a more direct confrontation with the west and i hope the bush administration has the wisdom not to give them that satisfaction

1981949 we have to have a conversation about what were going to do about the health of the people who live around here
1981950 maybe its a little worse than what it looks like based on the model
1981951 we try not to be alarmist but also to deliver what is the public health message here based on what this data says there is an increased cancer risk
1981952 there may be hot spots located in residential areas where monitoring is not occurring
1981953 thats a high number and obviously something wed like to see lower
1981954 theres still limitations to modeling actual air pollution measurements are much better than modeling and if you are able to measure contaminants in people thats even better
1981955 confirms what we already suspected that theres a big problem
1981956 we heard about this report more than two years ago
1981957 they said it was completed and it was just awaiting some internal tweaks why did they take so long to report it to the public
1981958 weve waited two years now when we could have been collecting that data
1981959 i share the frustration but i am satisfied that we produced the best quality information possible with this data
1981960 if we wait three days you cant see the tv
1981961 what if we create microsites for each segment of our business and hire a different seo agency for each
1981962 well for that we would expect you to do the plan execute on it and get some results in 1 2 months

1982007 getting students education and exposure outside the religious wackos controlling gaza seems like the only sane thing we are doing to bring about positive results
1982008 recall that a state of war requires two nations by making this claim you are officially recognizing the sovereign state of gaza
1982009 getting students education and exposure outside the religious wackos controlling gaza seems like the only sane thing we are doing to bring about positive results
1982010 its a question of proportionality of outcome if the probability of a missile harming an israeli is 1 200 roughly true than one should at least ensure that our retaliatory strikes have less than 1 20 chance of harming an innocent palestinian
1982011 wow since when did we start appointing 6 year olds as diplomats think thats bad just wait until we elect one president
1982012 its a question of proportionality of outcome if the probability of a missile harming an israeli is 1 200 roughly true than one should at least ensure that our retaliatory strikes have less than 1 20 0 chance of harming an innocent palestinian
1982013 getting students education and exposure outside the religious wackos controlling gaza seems like the only sane thing we are doing to bring about positive results
1982014 we do not usually punish people hijacked by pirates and brigands
1982015 also i find it a real hoot that colleges are liberal bastions is such a common comment attack on a blog which leans conservative at the very least run by mostly professors
1982016 yes but if you negligently kill innocent bystanders with your gun in your attempt to subdue the attacker
1982017 i read whittaker chambers witness for the first time this year and it keeps occurring to me ever since that we really didnt win the the cold war there were communists in the government but even subtracting them we still have lost our intelligentsia and media elites as well as much of our bureaucracy to the worldview of marx and engels rather than that of adam smith
1982018 its a question of proportionality of outcome if the probability of a missile harming an israeli is 1 200 roughly true than one should at least ensure that our retaliatory strikes have less than 1 20 0 chance of harming an innocent palestinian
1982019 sure but what has that got to do with gaza which by all accounts not a country
1982020 i just returned from the jewish museum in shanghai which made a big deal about the nations who would not give jews free transit out of germany
1982021 what noone will talk about is that the wars in iraq afghanistan and the triggering event of 9 11 could all have been avoided if immigration laws had been strictly followed and consular interviews required of the 15 saudi hijackers before admission to the u s the u s had nothing and still has nothing to gain by large scale issuance of student visas to saudis and those from other terror sponsoring countries
1982022 what makes saudis so special that they should not have to go through the same procedure oh since they are potential terrorists have lots of oil and support wahhabism we have to kiss up to them
1982023 if you limit your response only because your enemys weapons arent good enough to kill you arent you just inviting him to correct the defect
1982024 oh and just to forestall the obvious if the situation ever rises to the level of existential threat which qassams most certainly are not all notions of proportionality are off
1982025 gisha an israeli organization aimed at protecting palestinian freedom of movement says the problems the palestinian students faced are not out of the ordinary
1982026 in addition to the particular students who did not receive visas for technical reasons or unexplained security reasons there are hundreds of students in the gaza strip who were accepted by universities abroad and have valid visas
1982027 israel issues a comprehensive ban on students from gaza going abroad as part of its policy of collective punishment toward gaza residents thereby impinging on the right to education of hundreds of talented young people who want to study develop and create a better future in our region
1982028 ah yes all the israelis who parrot the old canard that americans control the press the banks and have a millennia old plan to secretly manipulate world events
1982029 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

1982051 the time is rapidly approaching for this court to find that broadcast like the internet and other means of mass communication is entitled to the highest protection from government intrusion and that there is no longer a factual basis for qualifying the level of first amendment scrutiny that should be applied to this medium
1982052 with broadcast television being just one of the myriad of ways that people can access lawful content including indecent content it no longer makes sense from a constitutional or policy perspective to give broadcast speech less first amendment protection

1982054 this is devastating not only to usamriid but pretty much all government research
1982055 the implication is that usamriid cant be trusted to police itself

1982081 the movie industry has been pushing the envelope and a lot of young ladies feel to be popular thats what they should wear
1982082 but to defend the young ladies the fashion industry markets what sells they make it very difficult for moms who want to find their daughters a decent dress that is not risque
1982083 i really think it helps just by having an enforcer there and knowing if they came in with the wrong kind of dress someone is going to make it appropriate
1982084 they were more careful in their dress selection this year they shopped harder
1982085 at least in her casual clothes she had the same design made up in four or five color combinations

1982087 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
1982088 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule and china more than any other country has enabled the survival of the brutal burmese regime
1982089 the chinese government and the olympic movement should be ashamed to have a leader from this ruthless regime as an olympic guest
1982090 at the very least beijing should tell the prime minister that its time for political reform in burma as a responsible power china should put the burmese peoples welfare first ahead of profit from business deals and arms sales that only benefit the regime
1982091 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
1982092 in some swing states with concentrated pockets of fundamentalists and evangelical christians like ohio pennsylvania colorado and virginia the ads could have particular impact suggestions that sen obama is the antichrist have been circulating for months in bible study meetings in towns like chillicothe ohio where congregants compare his remarks and his biography with verses from the bible
1982093 like many people especially women i got interested because of aung san suu kyi and i learned about burma and how she represents the hopes of the people of burma and how those hopes were being dashed by her house arrest and the fact that her party won the elections and never had the opportunity to have power at all
1982094 this swelling outrage presents the generals with an urgent choice be part of burmas peaceful transition to democracy or get out of the way for a government of the burmese peoples choosing

1982117 but why not put it into a facility that can be used 365 days a year and not just for racing but for driving and motorcycle rider training the drift bowl will give kids somewhere to drive in safety and under supervision rather than trying these things on the street

1982207 when a firefighter dies everyone knows him because we are all from the same cut
1982208 it affected everybody emotionally but everybody accepted the challenge and went back to what we do everyday
1982209 they are experiencing great grief about the missing and those who are injured
1982210 he felt responsible for making a difference in this world
1982211 if they were having a tough day he was the one to step up to the plate
1982212 the injuries that they have im optimistic theyll completely heal from
1982213 we are not a huge company this has had a very severe impact on us we know between the grayback people on the aircraft and our company its been a huge blow to southern oregon and i know its been a huge blow to the firefighting community

1982216 why did you choose this gal to take care of your child
1982217 i wish for him not to be a part of katelynns life
1982218 write up a piece of paper that just explains that to me
1982219 my sense was she just wants to get this sort of straightened up you know
1982220 she is now having quite extensive difficulties in her school with her learning theres possibly learning disabilities theres possibly behavioural issues and in order to access shes already tried to access the services through the school for counselling for this little girl and they wont allow her too sic because she is not the custodial parent
1982221 she thought that was all she needed to do was to come and say that she was fine with it and she feels like shes done her part i guess im assuming
1982222 and we need to kind of just have this over now but if we had no further information and we just need to get this girl settled
1982223 so i am just going to make a final custody order
1982224 when mom wanted to come and see the child she was welcome to come and see her
1982225 i mean you are taking on all the responsibility and we are never going to be exactly sure what kind of shape mom is in
1982226 accountability is the right way to go but were going about it the wrong way and heres what i propose
1982227 first stop using no child left behind as a blunt instrument to punish schools
1982228 they say every year they want to have more games on campus
1982229 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
1982230 on july 16 2008 the closest date of the weekly reports to the july 15th low in the dollar index the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth to put this phenomenally high growth rate into perspective for the twelve months ending this past july 16th assets in the federal reserves custody account grew by 17 3 which is less than one half the growth rate experienced over the past three weeks
1982231 the powers that be are treating the symptoms dollar weakness and not the disease runaway debt until that changes you can expect renewed dollar weakness against hard assets the reason many of us are bullish on gold is most governments seem to be in a competetive devaluation of their currencies to maintain export competetiveness in this environment all currencies will decline against commodities and real money gold
1982232 that may be the dumbest application of grade school mathematics i have ever read in my life
1982233 as to gold specifically the 200d ma for gold is about 885 i now believe that level will be thoroughly tested as it was the week ending june 15 with a cycle bottom possibly in the 850 860 level before the price of gold soars again
1982234 the support found during the lows of sept oct 2006 and july aug 2007 will likely be found again this year june through october as traders move capital out of mortgage backed assets ie humungous bank amp broker and reits future highs within maybe two or three years will likely be in the 1500 2000 or 2500 range

1982236 we view the citigroup settlement as a major turning point in the auction rate market development as it sets a precedent
1982237 we are happy to see the dealers beginning to step up to the plate
1982238 theres a stark contrast between the two major presidential candidates on trade probably the starkest weve seen in decades
1982239 mccain is an unabashed free trader obama has a much more skeptical view about trade liberalization
1982240 for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust
1982241 the deep deep racial divisions within the party of jim crow
1982242 so racist that they dont even realize that white americans have moved on and so whenever there is a campaign like this such as this they always use racism in order to intimidate white americans
1982243 you have to learn to be an african american and we dont have time to teach you
1982244 the initial injuries were reported as serious injuries but they have been upgraded again all the injuries that were reported are all non life threatening
1982245 we were very fortunate nobody was killed in this collision and again most of the injuries were minor in nature the location of the collision itself was close to a community centre where the bus passengers could be removed and taken care of
1982246 ems crews were on the scene immediately and setting up triage
1982247 i expect that we shall conclude our deliberations this week
1982248 my team is alarmed at some serious inaccurate statements made by your excellency at the briefing of parliamentarians today namely you stated that the dialogue team had agreed to have a transitional government for two years after which we shall hold presidential elections which position has not been discussed or agreed upon
1982249 instead of being the mediator he was actively campaigning for a government of national unity at that stage we had not discussed it we were agreed on a shared government but not the type that he kofi annan was discussing
1982250 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
1982251 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds

1982255 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
1982256 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
1982257 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
1982258 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
1982259 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
1982260 miniature objects that offer cool and dynamic content that can be placed on any page on the web theyre free and available for you to add to any webpage that you own
1982261 it is not clear to me that google gadgets have been adopted in a widespread fashion
1982262 i love being on the bleeding edge of whats coming next
1982263 google gadgets are designed with an open architecture so that anyone can produce them
1982264 the net result is that unless you look at a gadgets code you cant be sure what it is doing
1982265 in our wildest imagination we could not have predicted this result i mean truly pathetic
1982266 you see we believed that this was the ideal gathering to find top quality men and women to serve in this vital mission
1982267 but instead we found you boys and girls in a perpetual state of arrested development you all sicken me
1982268 are they actually dead or are we going to see them in the zombie season of lost
1982269 you have not seen the last of either of those characters death is a relative term really in the timelines of those characters there is a lot of story yet to be told
1982270 seventeen hours of the show beginning in february of next year and seventeen hours in the february of the following year and then lost will be done
1982271 the first season was just so amazing because we were trying to figure out how to do they show i think the adrenaline rush of excitement and terror that accompanied executing the first season would be hard to top for me
1982272 just with the raft launch it was back when the show was hopeful before it disintegrated into utter despair
1982273 now definitively in front of 6500 fans that there will be a rousseau flashback
1982274 we will say this you will see this year definitively rousseaus story but to use the word flashback might be disingenuous
1982275 there will still be flashbacks and flash forwards on the show but were going to be doing something a little different this year and mixing it up but danielle rousseau will be in season five
1982276 they do actually know quite a bit but they dont know everything were basically putting together the last two seasons of the puzzle and a lot of that involves things that will happen at the end of the show we have an incredibly fantastic writing staff we work collaboratively breaking the stories in the room so theyre very much part of the creative process absolutely
1982277 they would do fine without us is what carltons trying to say
1982278 obviously were very invested in that relationship jack shepherd is the hero of the show hes where it all begins
1982279 is very central to the show and there are very interesting permutations of the jack kate sawyer relationship that are going to play out during the course of the next two seasons of the show
1982280 this season affords us an ability to tell stories in a fresh and exciting way when season five starts youre not going to know when and where you are
1982281 but there will be storytelling both on and off the island and in different periods of time
1982282 you cant have it all planned out we try to actually write ourselves into corners every day thats whats really thrilling well say what if we put the characters into this particular predicament how are we going to get them out what we try to avoid doing is filming that without knowing the answers in the writers room i think thats almost kind of the exercise
1982283 we force the show to evolve and sometimes we do things we really shouldnt do if you blow up the hatch then you cant do any more stories in the hatch we feel like the audience is going to get frustrated unless we move it forward
1982284 how old is richard alpert and how many toes does he have
1982285 obviously we have hinted before that aging on the island is a different process and weve seen richard alpert in different time periods and he looks pretty much the same hopefully that is an engaging mystery that will keep you watching through the season and well actually learn a lot more about his history this season
1982286 if you were looking forward to seeing richard alperts feet you will see him barefoot this season
1982287 its imperative that the dharma initiative be reconstituted to continue the research and do it now time is not just of the essence it
1982288 you are too stupid to discuss my campaign without help
1982289 he flip flops so often that its safer if they just cut and paste
1982290 since most of his supporters are illiterate its the only way they can meaningfully contribute coming next month a mcdonalds style interface with pictures of common attack points a flat tire little back guy in diapers a black playing card etc
1982291 i cant afford to put gas in my car to commute to work
1982292 are you better off now than you were 8 years ago
1982293 youre just the sort of person i imagined marrying when i was little except yknow not green and without all the patches of fungus
1982294 a blessing or as the breath or essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds
1982295 its not where you are thats important its whats there

1982299 an associate might be seven or eight years out in a large firm and never take a deposition
1982300 we get a lot of rising stars from big firms who dont fit into the big firm model
1982301 to me it is obvious they jump because they dont want to be a robot in a lawyer factory
1982302 the expectation is that the partner must handle the case when the truth is less senior people are capable if the preparation is there
1982303 a part of how we recruit people is a commitment to getting them more opportunities to stand up in court representing a paying client than ordinarily would be the case we bend over backward to make the client comfortable with the idea an associate is ready to argue their case
1982304 this decision was more important to us than just collecting the debt
1982305 we claimed the dealer breached his trust with kubota and this was different from an ordinary debtor creditor situation
1982306 he was very interested it wasnt like he just handed off the case
1982307 ryan did a great job it was good for us and it was good for the law firm we had not used hunton amp williams and now we have a relationship with the firm
1982308 when i came out of clerking for rehnquist i looked for a firm where i could get experience in court
1982309 the firm gave me this opportunity and in terms of job satisfaction it is significant it meant a lot to have something i was intellectually responsible for
1982310 we compete successfully with the larger law firms for qualified associates by offering unlimited responsibility for the associates
1982311 we are looking for people from larger firms who want to be in court be on the front line and be accountable
1982312 real lawyer work holtz recently argued a motion to dismiss in a state trial court and handled a relatively small real estate dispute for a major client
1982313 i dont know too many places where a seventh year associate is allowed to do trials on his own especially for a significant client
1982314 what attracted me to morrison was the chance to become a more complete attorney i am in court probably two days a week i used to be nervous in court now it feels like home
1982315 people come to my firm when they realize that to be satisfied in their careers they have to learn how to strategize a case and talk to clients
1982316 at altheimer amp gray i had to fight to prove i could take a deposition which was pretty frustrating
1982317 the big firms offered more of that a nice salary to remain a cog in a machine it was easy to turn that down here i had the opportunity by necessity to do voir dire take depositions and argue cases i got the experience to make partner in two years which probably would have taken eight or 10 years at a large firm
1982318 we have a close relationship with kaplan that includes working with associates
1982319 there are many benefits for us we learn who among the young attorneys fits our pattern and practice best and they learn our company thoroughly that has given us the ability to utilize kaplan lawyers instead of growing larger in house because we are working with people who know our company we are not constantly teaching new attorneys so my people can handle a larger volume of cases
1982320 clients are often not willing to let an associate take a critical witness in a bet the company case but depending on the case the associates brief and argue motions run jury charge conferences handle experts
1982321 think about it the red sox even if they win the world series and play the max home games 11 would have to see a difference of more than seven times what the rays make on the market for their games despite not having any additional seats to sell

1982328 totally disagree with you bob i hear your opinion its not accurate its not accurate to the facts that ive presented to you i need to protect the football team it is about the football team i understand how large brett is and he totally agrees with my focus we talked about it openly we talked about moving forward to try to get to that spot but we did not get there thats the truth you can keep asking me the same question my answer is not going to change

1982377 we want to find out whether theres a role for messaging in the browser
1982378 the initial prototype is a primitive implementation with many bugs and subsequent versions will include changes that break functionality and delete all your messages making you start over from scratch
1982379 extensions are a great way to prototype functionality in firefox
1982380 but i want to stress that this is a labs experiment and doesnt mean were adding this in firefox
1982381 the reason why were conducting this experiment with snowl is because we dont know if messaging should be in the browser but we want to find out that and a lot of other things
1982382 we want to gather as much feedback as possible then make the decision to continue if it seems promising and adds significant value to the browser
1982383 those are the questions we need to address but its still a successful experiment even if something doesnt make it into the browser
1982384 we could add some core messaging functionality to firefox or take just a piece of snowl to put in the browser or maybe do it some other way as a more mature extension separate from firefox
1982385 haproxy versions 1 3 15 2 and 1 3 14 6 have been released to fix a major bug in request queue handling the problem was that due to a design problem it was possible for new requests to be immediately served by a server before a request in queue would be served that caused some requests to remain in queue until they reached the queue timeout after which either they would eventually be served or return a 503 error code to the client

1982393 the three have spent more than 150 days in custody yet no charges have been filed and no evidence of any crime has been produced
1982394 if the authorities have no credible basis to charge tissainayagam and the two others they should be immediately released
1982395 the attorney general should release the three instead of continuing to violate their rights under domestic and international law
1982396 by detaining a prominent government critic without charge he is seriously risking the credibility of his office

1982401 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
1982402 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1982403 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
1982404 it has become imperative to move for impeachment against musharraf
1982405 the judge gave salim ahmed hamdan credit for five years and one month of his pretrial incarceration at guantanamo bay making him eligible for release from custody in five months the sentence was a stunning rebuke to prosecutors who had insisted on a prison term of at least 30 years and portrayed hamdan throughout the trial as a hardened al qaeda warrior
1982406 i hope the day comes that you are able to return to your wife and daughters and your country
1982407 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
1982408 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
1982409 as a result of many hours of shelling from heavy guns the town is practically destroyed
1982410 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
1982411 these are the people whose bodies were seen in their yards and in the streets
1982412 this is very sad and this will incur a response
1982413 some of them are studying so they have different ideas backgrounds
1982414 the thing ive done the most are shovel and pick axe
1982415 ive spent about three weeks swinging a pick axe which is very uncharacteristic of my daytime work the rest of the year its very therapeutic
1982416 i was looking for an opportunity to bring them over in a relatively exciting environment and sort of share with them the reality of the bible lands and historical sites that are so well explained here
1982417 it gives you a concrete grasp of that whole story of the bible that you cant otherwise carry with you it lasts a lifetime so i think that my kids will benefit from this experience for many many years
1982418 youll hear hebrew german french english all mixed together another thing is youre really digging up the heritage of a land and from canada theres not so much of a deep history
1982419 excited to be digging the dirt that jesus dug 2 000 years ago
1982420 on every level its a learning experience from archeology to religion to seeing the actual biblical sites
1982421 you read about it in the bible but to be there and see it words cant even express
1982422 i am covered by the blood of jesus i will come home
1982423 we admired him and because of him none of us will ever be the same
1982424 which is why he was on the front lines on saturday july 26th
1982425 i was kind of effectively wild they were chasing my fastball up so i kind of used that a lot
1982426 hes a young guy whos going to get better and better
1982427 for me being most effective i need to be aggressive
1982428 youre going to have those days when you feel a little rusty and a little off
1982429 those are the days youve got to work the hardest to get outs any way you can
1982430 those are the ones i threw right down the middle
1982431 some guys got base hits on not so good pitches but if you could take two back those were two bad mistakes in key situations
1982432 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out
1982433 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many license holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the license to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees

1982441 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
1982442 it means that market is not going to exist at all its barely hanging on now

1982458 the magnitude of the dollars moves and the breaking of key technical levels suggest that a major shift in the outlook toward the dollar is occurring
1982459 the main driver continues to be evidence that the financial crisis and economic downturn are becoming more evident in japan and europe
1982460 the continuing rally in the dollar in recent days and the recent sharp fall in commodity and oil prices has seen gold come under further pressure
1982461 as expected gold has once again experienced weakness in the summer doldrums but a seasonal low is likely in the coming days and the length of the consolidation since march should see a very sharp rally in golds favored autumn months
1982462 given that the financial and economic news has been as bad as if not worse than that out of the euro zone the dollar rally is likely to be another dead cat bounce
1982463 not encouraging with july sales and jobless numbers both disappointing

1982468 there is a chance things will settle down that there will be more listings on the market and that prices and growth will ease the next year or so
1982469 are prices going to fall 20 per cent the way they did in the u s probably not
1982470 but its pretty clear that things are weakening and theyre going to continue weakening for some time

1982476 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
1982477 it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
1982478 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
1982479 it would have been great to make it back to williamsport in consecutive years
1982480 for a georgia team to do it wed have made history
1982481 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
1982482 i think its self selecting those who would be inclined to write something like that just dont have what it takes to read a vc post

1982485 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now

1982489 it should be to the point if its over 20 minutes long youve lost everybody ive been to church weddings that go on and on and on and people cant wait to get out of there you dont need that
1982490 when i saw all the flowers and the gazebo i thought this is perfect
1982491 we could have a real small intimate wedding we wanted an untraditional wedding where we could do whatever we wanted to do
1982492 thats a row of peonies that my mother started she planted that birch tree and she wanted the waterfall on that hillside
1982493 and she would say well from now on were growing flowers out there she won out
1982494 in case theres somebody out there who got married here who wants to buy it as an anniversary gift for their spouse
1982495 we met in stillwater she was a nurse at the hospital

1982501 a few other companies have since approached twitter and made arrangements with us to gain access

1982504 so i decided to turn things on their head and make them get data from us if they cant keep up its their loss
1982505 ive published the first version of a jingle sip mapping spec
1982506 the first step is realizing that you have a problem that xmpp can solve
1982507 a recognition that the technology that is more than instant messaging might be poised for a role in more than just instant messaging
1982508 once a user is registered to the application he can log in using his openid after logging in the user can register start and stop the internal xmpp client associated with his account
1982509 while i think xmpp is a great way to connect people to systems or other people i think there are better ways to connect systems to systems
1982510 openid oauth buddy lists beyond im xmpp pubsub instead of http polling
1982511 the result is that the xmpp subscribers will receive something close to real time notification whenever a new feed entry has been published
1982512 it means that any atompub clients will be able to post to a specific node in your pubsub tree
1982513 sign on young man and sail with me the stature of our homeland is no more than the measure of ourselves our job is to keep her free our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all to this solemn purpose we call on the young the brave the strong and the free heed my call come to the sea come sail with me

1982520 an isolated computer is quite never really disconnected from the outside
1982521 for many consumers theres still some confusion on whether their devices can even play it or if you need a specific plan but with the publicity around devices like the iphone people are realizing what their phones are capable of and were expecting a good amount of video traffic
1982522 the fcc and state regulators sat on their hands and let them get away with it and finally ordinary people took matters into their own hands and they won

1982528 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
1982529 we fully support openmokos decision to publish the schematics of the u blox gps receivers
1982530 why should industry be afraid of opening up its design
1982531 schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success service and satisfaction in the market we believe our products would be incomplete without them
1982532 one of the freedoms we value the most is the freedom to explore to fully understand the details of complex systems to adapt and enhance them
1982533 we now take our commitment to openness to the next level by releasing our schematics to the public allowing anyone to find out how the system works and how to improve it
1982534 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1982535 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so
1982536 hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1982537 the conditions are not unfavourable at the moment and my understanding is that we are not going to be taking any extra measures
1982538 the conditions are really tough with the pollution and its really hot we dont have too many days to adapt so i hope to be much better than today
1982539 i know this doesnt work in ie but too bad

1982542 treat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being

1982549 really low prices and they should be of very good quality thats the only thing we look at we would never look at anything else we would discard anything else that doesnt fall into those boundaries whether its home furnishings or its greentech products
1982550 we will be very active on the boards of these companies i think we can contribute somewhat in terms of commercializing the product they are developing and then obviously distributing the product as well
1982551 within one or two years i think well be between eight and 10
1982552 its quite natural that for instance solar panels are more interesting to spaniards and californians and so forth than they would be to swedes
1982553 initially we will be looking more in europe than anywhere else but we do not have any geographical restrictions for our investments once a company is up and running in five or seven years or something like that and if we exit from that company the money that weve earned in that investment will stay within the ikea greentech fund
1982554 look over the shoulder of top traders and see how the best invest
1982555 we have learned that because yalicoo is a social trading tool and a game people are very willing to share information about their methods and stock picks many of the traders make the same stock picks in yalicoo as they do in their real trading portfolio

1982557 for a while now ive been looking for something to integrate my linux mac corporate environment with windows active directory i was hoping for centralized authentication at best as i found out
1982558 it is not just an authentication system it ensures policies drive mappings configurations proxy settings ms office behaviour and defaults security standards etc deploys software and printers to users and computers
1982559 how does it compare to other authentication systems such as edirectory or open ldap
1982560 yeah we are doing all of that with our stock rhel samba 3 systems just fine theres really no need to buy kerberos ldap samba support from another vendor that is why we pay red hat
1982561 youre just the sort of person i imagined marrying when i was little except yknow not green and without all the patches of fungus

1982566 now our stance now is to watch the political developments and the security agreement we will see if there will be a withdrawal timetable or not we will wait for the results these cells have not yet conducted any operations
1982567 its premature to say what the aspiration goals and time horizons are going to be
1982568 sit together to discuss the problem and find suitable solutions
1982569 the status of kirkuk is indeed a sensitive issue that needs to be addressed in a serious fashion but it is an issue that cannot be solved through the legislative mechanism of the election law
1982570 the election law should not be held hostage to that problem
1982571 some irresponsible chinese bloggers are hurting the korea china relationship
1982572 i think that in the old days the concept of national territory was more loosely defined in the minds of people in east asia as people traveled more freely between the regions which are now the two countries today as people have come to have a strong national identity some of the historical heritage that both china and south korea had shared together before have become a source of dispute
1982573 the local taiwanese media even falsely quoted chosun daily as the source to dress up their article as convincing
1982574 all the misunderstanding would not have happened if the chinese local media did a quick check on our articles on the internet first before going to write a story based on what they gleaned from the internet forums and blogs
1982575 the problem in all of this is that south koreans are discussing the issues among themselves on the korean internet while the chinese are discussing the issues among themselves on chinese internet
1982576 they should talk to each other to solve these problems
1982577 even though people visit each others country frequently i think there are many things the two countries still dont know about each other
1982578 we see little upside from the acquisition while the downside risks are disproportionate
1982579 many megachurches seem to be nothing more than the equivalent of a big box store delivering goods and services to the religious consumer

1982587 i have great passion for the game of hockey and look forward to working alongside brad as he taught me so much as a player
1982588 i share his goal of preserving the rich tradition of gopher hockey and striving to bring additional championships to the u of m
1982589 it was amazing i could go through every adjective i know amazing incredible exciting awesome it still doesnt do it justice
1982590 the best part about it was walking along and looking up in the stands and seeing maple leaves canadians in red standing up and then chinese in red standing up and waving canadian flags so many maple leaves i felt like i was walking into the stadium in toronto
1982591 the coolest part was hearing everyone in the tunnel singing o canada i had chills as i walked into the stadium
1982592 they hope that through the olympics the international community will get a better sense of where china is today which they say is a very modern and very different china from a few years ago
1982593 a lot is on the line for the chinese government certainly also for the chinese people there is so much pride and nationalism here
1982594 this has been a very ominous video tape that has emerged it shows the 2008 logo up in flames and also a simulated explosion over one of the venues
1982595 for a supposed multicultural world or at least its being pushed on western countries aka white countries there certainly wasnt a lot of multicultural people at these opening ceremonies a lot of black hair
1982596 chinese human rights activists are being detained harassed or forced to leave beijing while their supporters abroad are being prevented from going to china it is against this backdrop that the chinese government and the international olympic committee are launching the 2008 summer olympics today
1982597 we cannot remain indifferent to the fate of the prisoners of conscience these peaceful demonstrations will offer a response to the cynicism of those who will sit with their arms crossed inside the beijing stadium on august 8

1982683 they can play with the authenticity and energy of a real village band but also make sense of that music for an international audience in a big concert hall muzsik s know their music inside out they have been to the transylvanian villages where it is played and have worked with the master musicians who live the music in hungary the band have brought traditional hungarian music to thousands of school kids showing its beauty and relevance sadly as the villages of romania catch up with the rest of europe this music is disappearing the international success of muzsik s not only makes the music better known but helps it survive at source as people realize that it has a value internationall y

1982700 who would have imagined that the 2004 presidential election would represent something of a last chance for the democrats
1982701 but conservatisms progress goes much deeper than the gains that the republican party has made over the past half century or the steady decline in democratic registration the right clearly has ideology momentum on its side in much the same way that the left had momentum in the 1960s
1982702 thatcher could never rely on a vibrant conservative movement to support her unless you regard a couple of think tanks as a movement while american conservatism has been going from strength to strength for decades
1982703 the 2004 election was about as clear a vindication as we could have hoped for
1982704 that conservatism is the dominant force in american politics and that conservatism explains why america is different

1982709 the emotion of embarrassment is only felt in the presence of and because of an audience even if that audience is imagined the nature of the audience has only scarcely been investigated so far but it is clearly vital social identity theory holds that when people act as group members their world view changes
1982710 we will investigate what happens when the embarrassed person is not a member of the group particularly if they have a high status
1982711 in this case people might actually show joy at anothers misfortune schadenfreude rather than empathy
1982712 if you trip over in the street you feel very embarrassed of course people in your own group who witness this your friends or those close to you feel empathic embarrassment and try to alleviate the situation and make you feel better

1982733 what started us looking at this issue is the fact that senator mccain has declared his intention to maintain us forces in iraq for a hundred years
1982734 that means that mccain wants to control babylon for at least a century
1982735 we believe that the end times is near based on the pattern of wars earthquakes and other strange phenomena weve been witnessing since the start of the new millennium
1982736 given that it may be imminent the person who controls babylon must be the antichrist
1982737 as far as were concerned that was enough it means that mccain might easily pretend to be the redeemer
1982738 many people think that the antichrist will be a evil seeming leader but in fact the bible tells us that he will be charming
1982739 we can not be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election
1982740 to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimadation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
1982741 much of the congressional support is based on the desire to give our friends among union leaders my cap what they want

1982766 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have had seven years to deliver on their pledges that these games would further human rights
1982767 instead the beijing games have prompted a rollback in some of the most basic rights enshrined in chinas constitution and international law
1982768 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful

1983263 but my exposure to extreme beauty is ruining my capacity to love the ordinarily beautiful women of the real world women who are more likely to meet my needs for deep connection and partnership of the soul
1983264 if a man is talking to a beautiful female at a cocktail party and is then joined by a less attractive one the second woman will seem relatively unattractive

1983279 if you want to blame anyone for the rainbows youd blame our art director brian morrisroe
1983280 because brian is more the person who drove the art style into where it is but it didnt really come directly from him what he brought to the art team was concepts and ideas the idea of contrast the idea of using color more the idea of going for a more stylized look because what we were looking at before was more photo realistic really trying to get something that looks like a painting that was his goal

1983292 this industry has a serious image problem and doesnt promote itself very well to consumers despite there being lots of good news to tell by providing totally independent information and focusing on the many examples of quality out there foxy choice can help motorists make an informed garage choice to suit them their car and budget
1983293 quality workmanship is paramount of course so all motorists should know how to choose one of the safest mot car servicing and repair businesses in their area they also want to understand their choices when it comes to prices and facilities when they realise that dealerships and independents provide different service levels like waitrose and tesco for example they have a much better idea of what to expect
1983294 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
1983295 what we found most interesting about our handbook survey is that our customers learnt the most about the features of their car they didnt know they had from its handbook 79 indicated that had they not read their handbook these features would have gone unnoticed
1983296 this just goes to show how essential the handbook is and with ever more sophisticated vehicles on todays market the handbook is essential
1983297 the survey has been an eye opener and has given us feedback from customers so we can now look at ways of improving the information we give in our handbooks it also suggests that customers are happy with the current format and would not like to see the information taken online or removed from the vehicle
1983298 i use the handbook to refresh how seldom used features operate
1983299 how can you get the best out of your car if you dont know how it works properly reading owners manual is a must
1983300 always good for looking at fuses for electrical system please dont put it online or do away with it you need it to hand when you are in the car
1983301 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again
1983302 we kept at a decent speed and still averaged around 35 miles per gallon
1983303 having entered for fun and to raise money for the nspcc its fair to say that we were surprised to win and i suppose there is a david and goliath element to our victory
1983304 i think the other drivers initially thought it was a hoax that a smart had entered but they gave us more and more credit as the week went on and at the end they were genuinely pleased that we won
1983305 whilst i think ive converted quite a few of them to the merits of smart ownership the event has just strengthened my admiration for the car
1983306 the ride and economy are outstanding you can park it anywhere and there is room for my golf clubs its just a great little car
1983307 i puked almost every day for a year once consumed only three things during most of it health bars food supplement drinks and apples
1983308 how can you have a commander in chief who is in his eighth decade
1983309 what about that chap who came to see me about the budget darling hes not standing is he i know you made him foreign secretary recently and after all you do say its only for a couple of months would he do
1983310 putin is only in his fifth decade and is on the march where in beiging of course
1983311 obamas overseas trip particularly the mass rally in berlin has not gone down well
1983312 machiavelli advises the prince to be feared not loved the eus resolution for the new half century should be to give up trying to be loved
1983313 few studies examine the frequency and course of mild cognitive impairment in older adults but couuld it affect decison making in highly complex areas where answers require strong mental skillls and swift assimilation of new facts under the pressure of a campaign or public office this is not easy running a war with potential terror strikes imminent may be not a time when you hope your president isnt having an off day and a litte confused shiites sunni which are the bad guys
1983314 i think obama will choose evan bayh former indiana governor and now succeeding his father birch bayh the senator from the hoosier state
1983315 one of the most enduring chestnuts in the annals of democratic mythology is that they only lose elections because theyre such nice people
1983316 the idea that europe has any direct influence over our affairs is wildly overdone
1983317 the institutions of the eu have very few legal powers and they are designed purely to ensure that we stick to the agreements we have made with our partners in just the same way that uk civil courts ensure that you maintain any legal agreements you might make such as maintenance payments or finance agreements
1983318 you can break these agreements any time you like and if you do the court can impose fines on you for breaking them but there is a very strict limit to their power if we want to stick two fingers up to the eu in the end the only thing they could do about it ultimately is chuck us out
1983319 people who go on and on about how much of our law originates from europe are completely utterly ill informed an eu directive is not as we are led to believe a law it is an advice that we are obliged by our membership to incorporate that directive into our law at a convenient point thus no law in this country is imposed by the eu it is willingly written into law by our own government
1983320 it an eu directive is an advice that we are obliged by our membership to incorporate that directive into our law at a convenient point
1983321 do business with people you like and who share your objectives
1983322 leave your children enough money so they can do anything but not enough that they dont have to do anything
1983323 it takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it if you think about that youll do things differently
1983324 there are no called strikes in the ball game of investing
1983325 writelife com is a new interactive way for writers to create share publish and market their work

1983328 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
1983329 but from this there have been positives as the attention of the world is now on china and their human rights record is in the spotlight

1983331 based on our review we believe our investment in aol may be impaired after consideration of the duration of the impairment as well as the reasons for any decline in value and the potential recovery period we do not believe that such impairment is other than temporary
1983332 was this the real opening ceremony tune in to find out
1983333 when i bought it aussie she was swimming normally but six months later she was swimming about upside down
1983334 weve had her checked out and shes in good health i suppose she just likes to see the world from that point of view
1983335 she seems happy enough as far as you can tell with a fish she enjoys swimming about that way and has always swum upside down
1983336 its quite funny to see eddie swimming the right way while aussie is going round the tank upside down
1983337 she swims quite fast she is very fit and she eats her food upside down everyone around here knows about her shes a bit of a legend
1983338 lots of people come around to see her she is a great attraction particularly with children
1983339 were still not sure of its a male or a female but we call her she because she just looks like a woman
1983340 the inspector told us the fish didnt seem stressed at all its crazy that we had a complaint about our fish she seems to be having a great time
1983341 swimming upside down can indicate a problem with the swim bladder but it doesnt mean the animal is any distress
1983342 we may begin seeing pretty soon big american cities with no daily newspaper
1983343 were trying to wait and see whos going to step up and find a role
1983344 there are some guys who have been here a while and its their turn to step up and play up front we have some experience coming back but its a new year and we need to follow through every day if our attitude is right then we can work together as a team to move forward
1983345 i worked really hard in the off season trying to make myself a better football player so hopefully you can see more than what i did last year
1983346 you know going through the same thing two years ago gives me a lot more confidence
1983347 as a freshman the whole defense was new and the only returning starter was cameron jensen everybody was a little worried about us and i was a little nervous as well but having done it before it gives me a lot of confidence for this group coming up not only in myself but as a defense as a whole i know that our coaches are going to have us ready to play and well be just fine

1983352 wind river is demonstrating leadership in the area of multicore development
1983353 there are already a lot of negative impressions out there so i think for a lot of visitors and a lot of people seeing whats going to be broadcast that there could be some positive changes
1983354 i think that kind of imagery would feed those who would be more in the red scare camp already so maybe it would help to harden some perceptions of chinas rise
1983355 mass arrests that do not result in injuries are likely to have a more subtle longer term impact making it more difficult for mainland companies and the chinese governments new sovereign fund to invest overseas and damaging the image of goods made in china
1983356 if theres a bomb or something serious that goes wrong im afraid theyll just tighten up security like crazy and there will be a lot of negative fallout from that for quite a long time
1983357 if security gets so tight it would definitely slow business down
1983358 this should spur the international community and chinas leaders to more aggressive action toward environmental protection and remediation china deserves credit for being open to outside environmental help and it remains chinas best long run growth story
1983359 everybodys just praying it gets back to normal because so many sectors have felt downward pressure from the olympics
1983360 the information commissioners office ico has ruled that the nuclear decommissioning authority nda was right to refuse a request under the environmental information regulations eir for the draft report into potential areas of radioactive waste storage measures in the uk the assistant information commissioner believes there is a stronger public interest in maintaining the exception and therefore withholding the requested material than in disclosing it the draft report represents a dated review of the ndas position and disclosure would be likely to lead to researchers being less willing to be open and honest in such papers meaning that policy formulation in areas of scientific research other than radioactive waste storage may also be harmed which could undermine the effectiveness of future reports in the view of the assistant commissioner the draft report contains personal views of the particular author rather than the official position of the nda on the status of radioactive waste disposal and should not be released in general the ico does not normally accept that civil servants would be easily deterred from offering candid opinions through fear of disclosure

1983378 the charge of rape could not then brought when the victim was a man and anyway there wasnt anyone in the country who gave a toss about the alleged victim of the alleged crime the prevailing opinion then as it would probably be now was that he must have enjoyed it
1983379 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
1983380 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
1983381 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
1983382 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
1983383 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
1983384 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
1983385 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
1983386 these troops that are in georgia now they didnt come unexpectedly
1983387 they had been amassing at the border for the last few months they claimed they were staging exercises there and as soon as a suitable pretext was found they moved in
1983388 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech that he gave in 2002
1983389 hillary clinton was making a strong and valid argument for why john mccain will be the next president
1983390 in this case we couldnt have said it better ourselves
1983391 we are 18 million voices dedicated to seeing senator clinton reach the next milestone the white house
1983392 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
1983393 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
1983394 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
1983395 our troops are attacked by thousands of troops coming in from russia
1983396 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
1983397 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
1983398 i feel so sorry because shes dead she was just a very good person
1983399 the church is like one big family here were very close we stick together
1983400 oh but these problems can eventually be solved by science
1983401 the main reason for the armed resistance is the american military presence
1983402 if the american military begins to withdrawal there will be no need for these armed groups
1983403 weve been absolutely delighted with the level of interest from customers the media and industry alike
1983404 naturally were thrilled that so many people have signed up for this unique opportunity to evaluate the aspid on test tracks and public roads
1983405 weve worked very hard to redefine the modern sportscar and make it relevant to the needs of the 21st century almost everyone we met at the show has recognised that a lightweight and compact design is the way forward weve aimed for a car with outstanding performance and driveability and its exceptionally low mass ensures excellent fuel economy and correspondingly low co2 emissions
1983406 prospective customers have worked out that you can spend a lot more preparing other makes of cars for the race track
1983407 with the aspid it all comes as standard the car is unique inasmuch as it meets fia safety requirements as well as european homologation standards so it really can be driven from the road directly onto the race track without the need for any special preparation and after a hard race the car is robust durable and safe enough to be driven again on public roads
1983408 we particularly enjoyed the visits from other carmakers interested in the aspids technology which can be applied to a wide range of vehicles
1983409 the need to significantly reduce the weight of all vehicles is a highly topical subject and important to the entire industry in terms of delivering personal mobility that is environmentally friendly socially acceptable and economically sustainable
1983410 weve also been pleased with comments from motoring journalists and other media who took the opportunity for a close look at the car while it was at the show
1983411 tiny two seater as a showcase for some clever new technologies that could be used in more conventional higher volume vehicles
1983412 the amazing build quality and astonishing technology had me stunned and then i heard about the sub 3 sec 0 62 time check out the interior too and the neat f1 style steering wheel with all the controls and dials incorporated into one unit and if you go to a track you can even download telemetry from a previous lap by a pro driver and it will flash up braking points on the steering wheel for you seriously cool
1983413 the bmw studio is conceptualised to offer an experience that fully meets our customers requirements and make best use of the brands strength we are confident that the bmw studio will provide an exclusive bmw experience coupled with excellent service and the perfect ambience the bmw studio has evolved from fresh thinking that will align our thoughts and actions to the evolving aspirations of our customers
1983414 he should get a new trial with the assistance of the consul
1983415 he should get a new trial with the assistance of the consul
1983416 yes i havent im against the international court i didnt join the international criminal court because i dont want to put our troops in the hands of prosecutors from other nations
1983417 but we did get to avoid setting the precedent that the world court is the boss of us
1983418 having the state rape a man is hardly moral or righteous you clearly wouldnt consider it a moral act for this man to rape some women so why does it become a moral act for the state to have men rape him as his sentence
1983419 so some american who is caught in possession of marijuana in a foreign country could be executed on some other countrys tab and theres nothing we could do about it
1983420 appeals to their catholic religious principles by these justices when they decide abortion related cases
1983421 one doesnt have to be a catholic or a conservative or even against abortion to find roe v wade absurd
1983422 so you sic these justices should ignore the constitution and impose the catholic church position on the death penalty
1983423 people who arent catholic or conservative or against abortion rarely say that they find roe v wade absurd
1983424 one of the most curious things about roe is that behind its own verbal smokescreen the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found
1983425 so these justices should impose their own morality citing the support of the catholic church and evangelical christians on the american people as a whole when it comes to abortion
1983426 and they should also impose their own morality in the teeth of the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment
1983427 with enough effort and willingness to twist words i can construe what this person is saying so that it doesnt disagree with my preconceived ideas
1983428 here you have the most capable engineers working in state of the art research and development facilities the fiz has vast resources at its disposal from which we benefit directly conversely with its extreme technical challenges and the requisite pace of development the companys f1 involvement represents a unique testing ground for our technicians
1983429 the bmw group can transfer the knowledge gained within the bmw sauber f1 team directly into the development of standard production vehicles this makes formula one the ideal predevelopment platform for innovative drive technologies the new formula one regulations give us the opportunity to deploy innovative hybrid technology under extreme conditions and at the same time glean important insights for production development bmw customers stand to gain from this
1983430 no place in negotiations between employers and employees about their wages and conditions
1983431 offensive and bullying behaviour towards employees is against the law and unacceptable
1983432 employers need to mind their ps and qs when dealing with staff
1983433 as for you asking for your f ing payslips were not going anywhere so you dont have to keep f ing asking for them
1983434 if it was up to me i would close the shop for a week sack everyone and rehire people who do care about my business
1983435 this was bullying conduct against an employee who plainly felt it to be offensive and oppressive because she resigned almost immediately thereafter
1983436 with gasoline prices soaring interest rates on car loans rising and the economy wobbly those consumers who are still in the market for a new vehicle are opting for less expensive models

1983441 ab 2800 would force drivers to choose between fair insurance rates and protecting their privacy no driver should have to make that choice
1983442 where i drive when i get there and whether i stop on the way is not the business of my insurance company or any other corporation who wants to place eyes in my car
1983443 insurance companies fought mileage based insurance rates for eighteen years after the voters mandated them in proposition 103 the industry didnt change its mind overnight insurers back this plan because it will get their spyware into californians cars while doing nothing to make them more closely tie insurance rates to how far a motorist drives
1983444 a measurement of how much fun your car is versus how much impact it has on the environment
1983445 for nearly 50 years mini owners have enjoyed cars that are at once fuel efficient up to 37 mpg and fun to drive in the face of todays escalating gasoline costs more people than ever are expressing renewed interest in the original premium small car
1983446 what theyll find through the new campaign is that the third party data validates their choice mini cars outrank all other makes and models by the carfun footprint measure

1983455 we are proud of the occupant safety of roewe 550 which is designed to meet the 5 star crash test standards of the euro ncap

1983488 dopo essere stato eletto penso ad un riavvicinamento con air france klm ma ormai era troppo tardi molti nel suo partito ora si rammaricano per lopportunita persa
1983489 avrebbe comprato tutta alitalia accollandosi anche il debito ora questi signori stanno sperando che air france klm torni sui suoi passi o che lufhtansa faccia unofferta questo sarebbe veramente un miracolo
1983490 scommettiamo che oggi il 08 08 08 a pekino ci sar un secondo 11
1983491 in 58 giorni 4 ore e 28 minuti abbiamo rimosso piu di 50 000 tonnellate di rifiuti
1983492 in 58 giorni 4 ore e 28 minuti abbiamo rimosso piu di 50 000 tonnellate di rifiuti
1983493 la polizia si legge nel post di grillo ha sempre meno soldi manca la benzina per le volanti e gli straordinari non vengono pagati per questo schierano lesercito perch lo stato ha le pezze al c e fanno passare i tagli alla polizia per aumento della sicurezza lesercito conclude usato come i crumiri di una volta
1983494 it is very clear the distortion between real dangers and the steps that have to be taken to combat them measures are not in place in workplaces and roads to ensure that italian citizens are safe there people often think a road death is just an accident but the figures from other european countries show this is not true
1983495 mr castelli should stop and think i would like to remind him that in 2007 there were 185 deaths in manufacturing compared with 101 in france 113 in spain and 127 in germany
1983496 castellis statement is a dangerous attack on safety in the workplace
1983497 castelli should be ashamed of himself he should apologize to all those people who have lost a relative at work
1983498 castelli and other members of the government should start considering the value of human lives not just the value of business and tenders
1983499 strange he wants to take out deaths in the building industry and agriculture why are they second class citizens or maybe its because they are often foreign immigrants he should start fixing up the roads they have to use to get to work and invest in public transport
1983500 immigration policy must be based on human rights principles and not only on perceived security concerns
1983501 concern about security cannot be the only basis for immigration policy measures now being taken in italy lack human rights and humanitarian principles and may spur further xenopohobia
1983502 the mythical nature of rise of the argonauts encouraged me to go beyond tv and movies and compose the score for my first video game
1983503 rise of the argonauts is an epic game with some of the biggest greek heroes like jason hercules and achilles which inspired me to compose dramatic sweeping music to create the proper setting for this exciting adventure
1983504 in rise of the argonauts every design choice emphasises immersion we want players to actually feel like theyre heroes in ancient greece not just playing a game tylers experience with composing for film and tv gave him a fresh perspective and his music for the game set the epic tone we were hoping for
1983505 they just didnt count on that when the chips were down edwards would barricade himself in a comfort station giving everyone the mental image of him frenetically coiffing his pompadour for a full 15 minutes
1983506 my principal concern is that hell be forced to pull a tv preacher weepy apology so oleaginous that it kills all of the nations shorebirds
1983507 sdferr good old fashioned leftist free speech standards suppress what what must not be heard in matters of free discourse justifying it as good for the greatest good mind control
1983508 well he does not have an r in front of his name so this is only natural carry on people carry on
1983509 hey remember when that gay republican congressman got nabbed trying to pick up interns via im and fox kept calling him a democrat are we going to have an anecdotal evidence contest
1983510 remember the laudatory proclamation that gerry studds d ma got after he got caught shtumphing the pages
1983511 im aware of that happening he got off like a kennedy but foley could have tried to stick around too if he wanted just like you know larry craig has thus far despite his promises to step down and his actual legal troubles related to his own incident
1983512 bb are you really trying to compare a blackout of news coverage on a topic to a couple of singular mislabeled party identifiers on one network
1983513 so what if edwards had a love child dont most french politicians have child bearing mistresses
1983514 think carefully this incident may be true it is also based on a national enquirer story in the past the national enquirer has run several front page stories on the subject of bushs allegedly renewed drinking and his allegedly impending divorce from laura do you see where im going with this or do i have to have a seance to evoke wittgenstein and have him start pulling out the transitive property
1983515 just let him continue bashing one and i repeat one network as the symbol of all that is teh evil reich wing all the others ones are fair and cut their news in a straight line like obama used to cut lines of coke in college carry on bb carry on
1983516 but please oh please ohhh please please do a famous philosopher for us this morning
1983517 barrett does it ever occur to you that arguments to the effect
1983518 remember the laudatory proclamation that gerry studds d ma got after he got caught shtumphing the pages
1983519 yes bush has never been a problem drinker in the past and people who give up drinking never relapse particularly under stressful conditions so theres no
1983520 also im assuming you read those ne articles since you know so much about the smoke free situation described therein ill bet they were all over the pajamas media blogs eh because those people are really concerned with equality of coverage and not say jesus and explosions
1983521 on moral grounds i really dont have a solid take on what a politician owes to the citizenry with regards to his personal life but again most politicians have no regard for our own personal lives so off with his head
1983522 he should kill himself because hes an economic populist and a social conservative who cant even beat cheney in a debate which is pretty much the worst thing one can be
1983523 so what if edwards had a love child dont most french politicians have child bearing mistresses
1983524 from that i take it you have no regard for the good house lawyer so then why defend him
1983525 you just have to remember that one of their tertiary goals after the reinforcing primaries of
1983526 so then you wish to go on record that there is no media bias that the majority of the legacy media is apolitical fair and balanced in its treatment of both major parties
1983527 i am not defending edwards i am debating you guys on the subject of the media politically edwards is closer to you than me
1983528 proof of widespread us military prisoner abuse epidemic in our intentional mistreatment and inhumanity a military out of control

1983531 we have lost control over some parts of the city
1983532 the fourth battalion of the south ossetian army responsible for the southern side of tskhinvalis defences has begun forcing out georgian troops from this part of the city
1983533 its clear the real estate industry is terrified at the possibility of pro tenant reforms such as repealing vacancy control im going to have the freedom to throw down the gauntlet on this issue in a way my opponent failed to do as part of the deal that gave us the current system
1983534 while he continues to accept contributions from compromising corporations pacs and lobbyists i will stick by my clean money pledge because i believe my constituents deserve to be 100 confident that i am always fighting for them
1983535 an extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community
1983536 oh yes that makes more sense sure it was feiths office not the cia
1983537 great another extremely reliable unnamed source stirring the pot fantastic
1983538 an extremely reliable and well placed source in the intelligence community
1983539 unlike the central intelligence agency the pentagon had no restrictions on it regarding the production of false information to mislead the public
1983540 f ucking stupidest guy on the face of the earth
1983541 but the information was later revealed to have been based on forgeries
1983542 keith says badger thanks for the info but what did martino stand to gain from the forgery was the white house willing to pay a lot
1983543 the egyptian interrogators wanted more though they pressed him about saddam hussein supplying al qaeda with anthrax and other biological weapons
1983544 piped into the vice presidents office among other places and used by the bush administration to buttress its allegations that iraq was on the verge of supplying al qaeda with potentially terrifying weapons of mass destruction
1983545 a clean break a new strategy for securing the realm
1983546 should make a clean break with the oslo peace process and reassert israels claim to the west bank and gaza it presented a plan whereby israel would shape its strategic environment beginning with the removal of saddam hussein to serve as a first step toward eliminating the anti israeli governments of syria lebanon saudi arabia and iran
1983547 a comprehensive political and military strategy for bringing down saddam hussein and his regime
1983548 while the unresolved conflict in iraq provides the immediate justification the need for a substantial force presence in the gulf transcends the issue of the regime of saddam hussein
1983549 its no secret that credit ratings agencies rate municipal and corporate debt differently
1983550 it was and is impossible to conceive of an afterlife except as an improved version of this life harps mortalism p 11 granted the harps and houris conception is a nonstarter but is it really impossible to conceive of an afterlife except as an improved version of this life
1983551 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world
1983552 i will maybe watch highlight shows on tv later in the evening but i can never see myself watching it live
1983553 the government is trying to achieve perfection in every way
1983554 victoria osteen never touched her never screamed at her never attacked her never tried to get in the cockpit
1983555 the aggressor and the person who was out of control who flipped out was ms brown
1983556 sharon was attacked by someone in the community who supposedly represents a higher degree of human decency that had an affect on sharon

1983560 see the apology of one asshole he needs to be kicked out of tn and let him act in kannada films
1983561 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
1983562 hes basically a 22 year old whos a teenager he says things that are inappropriate
1983563 in my heart i know he didnt mean it he would be more likely to save a life than do to the other
1983564 hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
1983565 he always wanted to be a police officer to help people he wanted to help people who were victims of abuse
1983566 raymond is so nonpolitical he didnt even realize it it all comes down to one letter in a name it would have been a natural mistake for him to have made
1983567 an extremely loyal base of fashion and lifestyle conscious women the company pioneered the ad supported e mail model and has built an industry leading sales team
1983568 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
1983569 well written funny and wistful its about time jonathan calder lord bonkers achieved wider recognition
1983570 still churning out great work besides as lord bonkers diary secretary he should be preserved for the nation
1983571 when we talked to consumers about coke we realised they didnt know that it has no added preservatives or artificial flavours
1983572 we felt it was important to reassure coke drinkers of this fact
1983573 youll find all the ingredients in coke and all the other drinks we sell on their can or bottle
1983574 its big for us to hopefully keep on a good run here because were far from out of the race thats the team attitude
1983575 im going to go up there and show them what i can do and hopefully i can stay
1983576 n e r d amp kanye west everyone nose remix
1983577 your policy is to put this known toxin into the drinking water copying the stupid americans
1983578 youre not doing the essential responsible thing and checking out if thats causing harm to your people
1983579 if its such earth shattering stuff whats been going on since 2005
1983580 why is he on the street if they think its that important
1983581 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
1983582 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
1983583 if he really was the guy and he acted alone then thats pretty scary because thats a lot of damage that can be done by one person
1983584 usamriid is not like being in a shack in the wilderness its interacting with people in a pretty secure place
1983585 if i even suspected that he was anywhere close to being mental i would not have done the paperwork at all the state of maryland approved him
1983586 no gun gets out of here unless theres a background check
1983587 if we dont have a good handle on this at usamriid its probably true we dont have a good handle on it across the board
1983588 at that point the investigation still had a long way to go
1983589 i think what youre asking sir answers the question itself
1983590 he had been this way for a number of years going back for quite a number of years and was still able to carry on his professional life at usamriid
1983591 if you wait until september you can save thousands in stamp duty

1983596 lobby insider said nice try guido but mcbrides not the leaker hes on holiday in greece
1983597 the sun the voice of nulbour would the last one at the printworks turn out the lights hahahahaha

1983599 perhaps gordo tv can explain how such a superior intellect
1983600 when i grew up i tried to ask but there werent really answers
1983601 during my theological studies at university it became clear that i couldnt be a minister in the church
1983602 i concluded that christianity was paganism one of its most important dogmas is that god became man and if god becomes man then man also can become god
1983603 well you see he is a father of course but ideologically there was no connection i was so involved in my conviction that i had found the right path all the other items no longer had any importance
1983604 for him that was the end of the world my son is leaving germany to study in a jewish rabbinical seminary he told me i was crazy and renounced me as a son
1983605 people there dont get married and if they do they have one child
1983606 but the turks and the other foreigners have many children so it is a question of time that germany will no longer be german
1983607 germany will leave the stage of history no doubt about it
1983608 the area is closed because of a possible terrorist attack its just a defensive measure
1983609 but if i talk about them anymore the police will come and take me away
1983610 there are already people saying injection sites arent enough that true harm reduction is giving out heroin for free
1983611 theres really little difference between needle exchanges and supervised injection sites except for in a supervised injection site theres a nurse there
1983612 i believe im on the side of compassion and on the side of the angels
1983613 opposes supervised injection sites yet says he supports needle exchange which makes no medical sense
1983614 i acknowledge that its not 45 billion but its commensurate with canadas abilities
1983615 the movie uses money to define wealth but makes people question just what it is they are contributing to in their quest to achieve it in india some people have very little but still consider themselves wealthy in the west being an economic superpower people are taught to equate money with wealth and status
1983616 having been brought up in the west is always a challenge for me success is always evaluated by what you have if you have 100 you want 1000 and it just keeps growing from there at times i find myself getting caught up in that
1983617 i can relate to amal in being content in what you do in life my career as an actor has brought me happiness and personal satisfaction however the interesting thing about amal is he is totally in the moment i always have believed that one should live in the moment and always be content in what you do
1983618 i hope that it starts a dialogue between people i think it is tough to say that a 2 hour film will automatically change the way people live their lives but if a film can cause a discussion i think that is a great starting place
1983619 there was an idea there something i wanted to explore more because it was an idea i was personally interested in defining what wealth really means
1983620 to know how this happens at the molecular level how things bounce skip spin tumble push and pull represents a big leap in our understanding

1983623 the only toolkits with really good i18n supports are gtk 2 and qt among which gtk 2 is lighter gtk is a better choice if portability is important writing programs with gtk is really a pain though
1983624 if windows 98 and xp work quite well on old machines why my linux desktop needs a 1 0 ghz cpu 1gb ram

1983628 we want to offer this feature to customers while maintaining the quality and safety of the vehicle that weve been recognized externally for
1983629 being on team mustang is a special experience because we are all enthusiasts at heart and i was thrilled to be part of the warriors in pink project knowing that we would be contributing to the cure
1983630 the shock of my own diagnosis while working on this project highlighted to me how any of us can be affected when we least expect it and how important it is to work together to heighten awareness support the courageous women fighting the disease and ultimately find the cure
1983631 i am blessed to be a survivor while so many are still being lost each year to breast cancer and i am proud to work for a company that is committed to my survival

1983634 even though gas prices are high some consumers are still in search of a sport utility vehicle to meet their needs
1983635 for those consumers vehicles like the jeep patriot are relative bargains in their segment
1983636 we are making progress in our turnaround despite unprecedented headwinds in north america
1983637 the combination of much lower production volumes and higher steel costs has put considerable pressure on our 2008 operating results
1983638 but we are working to offset these challenges through pricing additional restructuring and cost reductions
1983639 and we remain focused on our game plan to turn around dana by rebuilding the management team improving operations tightening our strategic direction and employing a strong balance sheet
1983640 for the near term we continue to scale our north american operations through facility consolidations and workforce reductions to reflect a market thats very different than what was expected just six months ago
1983641 longer term were picking up speed with introducing what is essentially a new way of managing our business manufacturing our products and measuring our performance worldwide
1983642 the new dana operating system is already enabling our people to drive improved product quality customer satisfaction and financial performance
1983643 a fraudulent idp or iadp could result in legal problems or travel delays if a person is detained while using it to drive in a foreign country
1983644 people who buy them from fraudulent online brokers and spam e mailers are wasting their money
1983645 of the numerous independent studies conducted throughout the year vds continues to reflect real world long term vehicle quality and dependability
1983646 in todays economic climate consumers are considering durability more than ever as a key component to their vehicle purchase decision

1983689 hell still be retained as an enemy combatant after he serves his sentence
1983690 but as an enemy combatant he then becomes at that time eligible for the annual review board process to determine whether hes eligible for release or transfer
1983691 this sends a long shot across the bow to the political ideologues who hoped that the military would serve as their pawns
1983692 a vindication of the military not of the military commissions
1983693 if anything its a vindication of the system it proves that this system is very fair and impartial and capable of prosecuting war criminals
1983694 they chose to make this a test case for future cases to be tried in guantanamo but they never imagined that it would result in such a stunning rebuff

1983759 understanding and minimizing quality deterioration is critical for manufacturers as it is a key driver of owner satisfaction and word of mouth recommendations
1983760 it is imperative that manufacturers design models that not only achieve high levels of initial quality but also attain high levels of longer term dependability vehicle models that stand the test of time will help automaker profitability through superior owner satisfaction and recommendation rates
1983761 although automakers have achieved tremendous gains in initial quality and dependability in recent years by specifically addressing customer concerns these particular problems still prove challenging for manufacturers
1983762 the fact that these problems have endured throughout the industry for many years suggests that additional focus on these issues prior to vehicle launch would benefit not only consumers but also automakers through increased customer satisfaction
1983763 the gains in dependability for compact and midsize vehicles are good news for consumers who are downsizing their vehicles due to increasing fuel prices
1983764 consumers who purchase these smaller vehicles benefit not only from immediate gains in fuel economy but also from improvements in long term dependability compared with previous years

1983785 what i can teach neil abut making a women really really happy
1983786 after all most of my male blogging comrades seem to be clueless
1983787 if you want to impress a woman online send her a photo of dick
1983788 the way to make a woman happy is to jump on her the first thing in the morning and three minutes later ask
1983789 for the record asking if shed have sex with a mannequin will only make her really really uncomfortable
1983790 you cant make a woman happy thats like trying to cure a fatal disease the goal is to treat the symptoms so you can comfortably live with the illness
1983791 the major cause of unhappiness for women in the 21st century is a lack of meaning whats the point

1983794 the 10 million is going right into construction but the society is obligated to pay a major portion of that back which we will do through fundraising

1983796 the food security and nutrition situation could further deteriorate in the upcoming months if the price rise dynamic does not change
1983797 emergency operations must be continued and long term support to the vulnerable stepped up
1983798 more and more difficult for the population to satisfy their food needs through their own production
1983799 even by march things were starting to get difficult and people were already starting to lower the number of meals they ate
1983800 if they are reporting severe food insecurity they have crossed a red line
1983801 but the government does not want to declare an emergency and this has stopped ngos from being able to launch a widespread response
1983802 they are inadequate this could relieve hunger for a few days but we need bigger stocks to get through the lean season
1983803 grand agricultural offensive for food security or goana to boost senegals self sufficiency in food production senegal currently imports that vast majority of the rice it consumes
1983804 theoretically it is possible to meet these rice targets but jumping from 20 percent sufficiency to 100 percent given the trend of the past 20 years where yields have been stagnant or even decreased will certainly be a challenge
1983805 the government subsidised seeds by 70 percent this year and they were delivered on time we hope that if the rains which started early this year maintain at this pace we could even beat past production records
1983806 if he litvinenko had drunk the whole cup of tea he would have died instantly it is only because he sipped it that he lingered and polonium was detected

1983808 i scooped it out of the sink and threw it into the bin i was so lucky i didnt put my fingers into my mouth or scratch my eye as i could have got this poison inside me
1983809 for nearly three weeks we were working in a contaminated area the dishwasher the bar and the sink were contaminated in the weeks after what happened i was feeling hot and had a throat infection
1983810 in my private home and on my hands too and on everything that i touched
1983811 vladislav was described as someone who could help mr litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a moscow based private security company
1983812 sasha his name for litvinenko remembered the man making him a cup of tea
1983813 his belief is that the water from the kettle was only lukewarm and that the polonium 210 was added which heated the drink through radiation so he had a hot cup of tea the poison would have showed up in a cold drink
1983814 uk government source exposes how litvinenko assassination theory is based on false science
1983815 we are continuing to look at this case these charges may be upgraded given the serious nature of this attack and the victim is clinging to life were obviously praying for his successful recovery but if not were certainly going to be prepared to increase this to a murder charge

1983889 hes more of a downhill runner hes a big guy
1983890 im a small scatback or whatever you want to call me but ive been trying to prove to people that just because of my size doesnt mean i cant run inside and outside
1983891 they just think i can get the ball on a toss or a sweep and hit it straight outside but youve got to try to prove people wrong
1983892 hes not accountable to me when it comes to that
1983893 hes accountable to himself and his teammates i dont focus on the players who arent playing i focus on the 42 that are
1983894 we were just being selfish everyone wanting to make the play and not just buying into the program and getting the job done

1983917 by looking for new type of particles that have yet to be discovered one may hope to get insight into whether some of the very interesting ideas in particle physics are correct or not
1983918 models that attempt to unify gravity with the other forces often make predictions that there should be other particles present in the universe that have yet to be discovered if we can go out and discover those particles that are predicted but have yet to be found that could powerfully give us an indication were on the right track or alternatively tell us no were on the wrong track and we should look somewhere else
1983919 theyre looking down deeper and deeper into what may be the most fundamental particles of the universe
1983920 we know were not there yet we know protons are made up of other small things the idea is to find out about those small things
1983921 the debris of those collisions only lasts for a very short amount of time so they have to have extremely sophisticated detectors to take a look at these things a fraction of a fraction of a second

1984195 he said he had a bullet proof vest and a list of co workers and added that he was going to obtain a glock firearm from his son within the next day because he knew federal agents are watching him and he could not obtain a weapon on his own
1984196 a plan to kill witnesses names of intended victims photographs suicide letters and other relevant information
1984197 these were among the actions we referenced yesterday that had to be completed before we could close the case
1984198 apple is a market leader by creating a fervor for the iphone ipods and macs it has become one of the most cutting edge companies in the digital world
1984199 ultimately i think apple is a bit overwhelmed and i hope they realize that the lack of communication will hurt them in the long run
1984200 i dont think theres been a misstep at all i think the problem has been with the expectations compared with what any company in that position will choose to do and how theyll act
1984201 the problem isnt with what apple has done the only real problem is the difference between what apple actually does and what people expect them to do expecting a benevolent wide open unrestricted market for absolutely every application developer in the world was naive those of us from the wireless world instead of the computing world certainly saw this as being completely predictable
1984202 why is anybody in the world surprised by this of course there will be limits on the applications that are available of course there will be stifled development of course there will be things that dont suit the powers that be and will vanish weve come to expect that from the telcos but somehow the benevolent apple would provide us with an environment that was wide open without limits and without controls
1984203 the behavior is somewhat chaotic and ungoverned because there are a lot of people trying to do a lot of things and sometimes when you succeed so fast and so well the expectations rise a lot the big challenge becomes how do you meet those expectations this is what is happening at apple that they are dealing with a huge success the iphone has become iconic overnight so they are dealing with a huge uptake of stuff and this is moving so fast and chaotic in the sense that everyone wants to have their application on it
1984204 in the second quarter both revenue and subscribers grew 25 percent compared with last year

1984221 running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre
1984222 that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one
1984223 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me

1984260 its like the wild west out there everybody has a gun
1984261 at a time when every right thinking politician is concerned about levels of violence and gun crime this man is training his children in how to use a deadly assault rifle
1984262 why was he doing this this sends out the worst possible message and renders cllr hanif unsuitable to hold elected public office mr salmond needs to take decisive action or his own credibility will be under question
1984263 cllr hanif has not had the opportunity to put his side of the story
1984264 on the face of it he has not broken the law and there is no suggestion of any involvement in anything untoward
1984265 nevertheless this was foolish and inappropriate conduct cllr hanif has been suspended from the party and therefore the council group pending a disciplinary hearing where he will have the opportunity to explain himself and this incident
1984266 i regret that this happened and apologise it was foolish and inappropriate

1984276 one of the most walking friendly cities in the world
1984277 the population of london is projected to grow by 800 000 by 2025
1984278 increasing walking journeys is an important way of helping to manage the demands this increase would otherwise place on the transport system
1984279 having a baseline figure of walking journeys will allow us to monitor walking journeys and identify trends
1984280 it will provide access to a database of the number of people walking through the zone 24 hours a day 365 days a year
1984281 to make the cut an accomplishment has to be considered great by people who could pass a field sobriety test
1984282 our goal was and continues to be to provide developers with the ability to collaborate on open source projects using the tools they are most familiar with

1984286 the best way to improve transparency is to make sure that everyone has the same view of the same data at the same time
1984287 our focus has been very much to engage with nation states on governance issues but also with local communities to make sure that transparency is embedded in our process
1984288 it gives local residents a tool to prove their occupation of the forest
1984289 they can prove to outsiders that they live and use and depend on the forest
1984290 timber has played an important role in fuelling the conflict here and the government is keen to implement a system where timber can help aid the reconstruction of the country
1984291 much of the mining and logging is being organised by former warring party commanders and generals who given the limited success of liberias demobilisation disarmament rehabilitation and reintegration process and weak internal controls maintain their access to weapons and have the capacity to export their goods abroad
1984292 the potential for these kinds of it based timber tracking systems is good but the humans that push the buttons are the same humans that fill in the paper based forms or stand at the roadblocks now
1984293 there is a risk that they might be very good on the technical side but dont put the same effort towards political problems which wont necessarily produce the right results
1984294 the disappointment i have is knowing theyll never be able to get those boys out
1984295 i see those bodies in that black hole totally covered in coal
1984296 its amazing that at one point some of these ghost towns were teeming hilltops of people
1984297 its amazing what a century can do as far as depleting a resource and a population
1984298 whatever has been left behind for us to admire is there because nobody passing that way before has destroyed it
1984299 i wish that people had more respect for history lives were lived there to see these places wiped out is sad
1984300 i would try finding a town thats not on modern maps and id try to find out as much as i could about it i used a lot of early road maps from the 1920s and 30s i compared new maps with the old maps old mining areas are white on forest service maps from there i was able to pinpoint just when the town stopped getting recognition and was able to know when the town survived until
1984301 i moved out west from michigan in 1975 we stopped at the black hills area of south dakota on the way and found some former mining camps on the map we camped at these ghost towns ever since 1975 ive had the bug
1984302 i took the photos from 1985 1995 finally finishing up the book in 1999 during winters i would write the photo captions and historical information
1984303 wed go back to places we had been a year before and when wed get there some of the greatest buildings there were gone
1984304 ill bet that you wouldnt be able to find dozens of the buildings in this book or perhaps even entire towns anymore they wont be there anymore unfortunately
1984305 a lot of these old places are sitting on valuable property thats because in the past one place they didnt mine was under the towns but since nobody lives in these towns anymore its being done
1984306 you get goose bumps when you notice that something is missing and that you were able to be there before it disappeared youre glad that you got to see it but you feel sick too i consider the photos in my book a testimonial to the spirit and sense of historical importance most of us embrace as part of our past
1984307 granite is the most disappointing to watch i was there in 1977 when it had a full main street along with buildings on both sides of the streets five years later in the mid 1980s the change was quite drastic so much was gone
1984308 ive got leads on places i still need to go i hear that there was a mining town near bannack that was built on stilts i need to go and see if theres anything left
1984309 the 12 year old stayed home during the day he didnt go to school
1984310 think minnesota point state park it has a nice ring to it
1984311 if the state agrees to buy the land and according to other sources they are interested it would be multi million dollars for the city and would also be in line with the comprehensive plan
1984312 if youre looking at a standpoint of win win win win there are a lot of them
1984313 park point recreation area becoming state parkland would be a huge bonanza for the city plus we can fix the beach house and really do right by it there are just so many benefits if we can pull this off it would be wonderful for this city
1984314 the city administration is telling us duluth has too many buildings theres been talk about discontinuing the beach house getting rid of lafayette community center we dont even have a lifeguard down at the beach anymore
1984315 if the state were interested in creating a state park and taking over the operation of that land wed be happy to enter into those discussions with land currently zoned as parkland
1984316 i dont know if people understand how vital this land sale is to balancing our budget this fiscal year and bringing our reserve to 5 percent of our general fund budget
1984317 we remain in crisis situation as it relates to our budget

1984353 if you dont fall for the joke you get to be in on it
1984354 secondly is the fear of going without food and clothes
1984355 the bad thing is that we are always chased and beaten by government and municipal police
1984356 also when we sleep our things can get stolen its not a safe place for us
1984357 i struggle to find food but theres nothing i can do about the beatings
1984358 we are aware there has been an influx of street children in the town since the post election violence but allegations that police beat up such children are false
1984359 when they the children breach the law all we do is arrest them and hand them over to the childrens department
1984360 we have seen a considerable rise in the number of separated and unaccompanied children as a result of the post election violence throughout the rift valley
1984361 most of these children risk being thrown out on to the streets
1984362 i have so many friends we all look after each other
1984363 we sell these used boxes and scrap metal which we recover from peoples rubbish to buy a little food and glue
1984364 i take it so i feel high and so i can forget
1984365 i think we could have avoided at least some of this if we had agreed to do the town hall meetings
1984366 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
1984367 will allow people to see senator mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
1984368 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
1984369 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances senator mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
1984370 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
1984371 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for senator mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
1984372 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country

1984387 the way the escalation went was we came first under extensive artillery barrage from the separatists but in the end i was told that russian armored vehicles started to cross the georgian border and that was exactly the moment when i had to take this decision to fire back

1984402 the thinking now by the psychiatrist and counselor is that my symptoms may not be those of a depression or a bipolar disorder they may be that of a paranoid personality disorder
1984403 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs

1984407 no gun gets out of here unless theres a background check
1984408 if we dont have a good handle on this at usamriid its probably true we dont have a good handle on it across the board
1984409 at that point the investigation still had a long way to go

1984421 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
1984422 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
1984423 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
1984424 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
1984425 a lot of them have told me im glad ive got the hour drive it gives them that whole amount of time to leave it behind
1984426 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say for the next hour im decompressing im getting re engaged into what its like to be a civilian
1984427 if we can have an effect there where we can take people out thats a real plus in terms of saving american lives
1984428 our folks look at it as theyre in the fight theyre saving lives they dont feel too bad about that
1984429 i can confirm to you that if he is not arraigned tomorrow friday he will definitely be arraigned on monday
1984430 this is because the case against him is already ripe for trial long before now
1984431 me run away that is rubbish im back now and whoever wrote that article should bring his her efcc to come and arrest me so theres no need to clear any air
1984432 all the checks i didnt do for many years that nearly resulted to ill health ive done them now and i feel well in fact i feel like an 18 year old ready to launch back on the plough there is no problem at all im happy to be back and if im invited ill go am i not a nigerian what is there to answer in the last six years that they are asking how can a part time chairman of the npa be responsible for anything there whoever is making the wuru wuru there they know
1984433 sometimes in the year 2005 i was called upon by the chairman of the commission mallam nuhu ribadu to represent him in the committee set up by the federal government to review and verify contracts awarded by the nigerian ports authority hereinafter referred to as npa from 2001 to 2003
1984434 the name of the committee is special committee on review and verification of contracts awarded by the npa from 2001 to 2003
1984435 chief olabode george was the chairman of the board of directors of the nigerian ports authority during the period under investigation
1984436 the board of npa under the chairmanship of chief olabode george approved various contracts without due process and in clear violations of extant government rules and regulations orders and laws of the federal republic of nigeria
1984437 contrary to the above circulars and the relevant laws the board of nigeria ports authority under the chairmanship of chief olabode george illegally conferred approval limits of n60 million on the board n30 million on the executive management n10 million on the managing directors n2 million on the executive directors n700 000
1984438 the action of the board in disregarding the extant government rules and regulations on award of contracts contravenes section 203 of the criminal code
1984439 investigation revealed that the nigeria ports authority during the period under review awarded over 24 252 contracts valued at over n100 billion
1984440 the board under the chairmanship of chief olabode george during the period under investigation approved various contracts which only the ministerial tenders board or the federal executive council fec had powers to approve and thereby contravened section 61 of the criminal code 11
1984441 during the period under investigation various contracts which ordinarily should have been referred to the federal executive council fec or the ministerial tenders board for approval were fraudulently split into many units by the board under the chairmanship of chief olabode george with the intention of circumventing extant government rules and regulations so that the contract amount will fall within the boards approval limits for the purpose of gain making by the board
1984442 the act of fraudulent split of contracts is tantamount to abuse of office contrary to section 104 of the criminal code 11
1984443 it was also revealed during the period under investigation that contracts awarded by the board were generally inflated as can be seen from the report of the committee and annexures ii
1984444 the act of inflation of contract prices is tantamount to conspiracy and stealing contrary to sections 516 and 390 of the criminal code this action also contravened section 22 3 of the icpc act 2000
1984445 during the investigation chief olabode george was invited interviewed and interrogated by the committee
1984446 it was also discovered that chief olabode george left office with about four vehicles belonging to nigeria ports authority which prompted the committee to write to him as a result of which he returned the vehicles to the nigeria ports authority
1984447 contrary to government regulation the claimant occupied two properties belonging to the npa at ikoyi lagos and maitama abuja
1984448 even after the claimant had been removed as the chairman of the npa he was still occupying the two properties contrary to government regulations
1984449 it was also revealed that numerous contracts were awarded in foreign currencies at highly inflated rates for supply of items that were easily obtainable in nigeria markets items such as umbrella ball pens fire services equipment etc
1984450 most of the contracts awarded by the npa under the leadership of chief olabode george were not budgeted for contrary to section 22 4 of independent corrupt practices and other related offences commission act icpc
1984451 it was observed in the investigation that the nigeria ports authority was operating under serious pressure from top government functionaries legislators and party leaders for contract awards which was largely responsible for award of spurious contracts based on patronage rather than need
1984452 it was also discovered that 100 advance payments were made at the nigeria ports authority london office in contravention of the provisions of the federal government circular no f 15775 of 27 june 2001 which stipulates a maximum 25 for all upfront payments
1984453 between august 2002 and august 2003 nigeria ports authority made 100 advance payments to 23 contractors at their london office and some of these contracts were yet to be executed as at the time of the investigation
1984454 i must be sincere with you the arrest is long overdue we have all been expecting this for the past two years considering the rot that he george left at npa as the chairman of the board
1984455 we hope that efcc would pursue the case to its logical conclusion by not sweeping it under the carpet because to arrest is one thing prosecution is another thing we in ac strongly welcome the idea to investigate the rot in npa
1984456 the inability of the efcc to arrest george in the past few years is one of the things that i crucified nuhu ribadu for and for which i supported his demotion by the police service commission
1984457 at a point when the efcc was making mass arrests of embezzlers in nigeria the issue of bode george and the npa dampened the peoples spirits as he seemed untouchable

1984468 i believe this is a tremendous step forward in allowing gamers to really own the game in a way that hasnt been possible before
1984469 the most exciting thing about games is always seeing new ideas emerging
1984470 what youre seeing with spore or littlebigplanet is a really interesting development where large publishers such as ea or sony are basically providing a platform for gamers to start to create and more importantly to share content themselves a step beyond xbla or xna which still require pretty strong technical development skills
1984471 i believe this is a tremendous step forward in allowing gamers to really own the game in a way that hasnt been possible before and this is where i see some really exciting innovation coming from in the next few years
1984472 eidos has its own ideas in this area although were not quite ready to talk about them just yet
1984473 the great thing about these services is that they allow real innovation big aaa titles are such complex projects that its difficult to introduce radical changes part way through development particularly once youre past the prototyping stage
1984474 developing downloadable games or using tools aimed at small teams or individual developers allows you to experiment with new forms of gameplay and to change things quite dramatically without incurring huge costs or causing knock on effects to dozens of other people in the team that all helps foster a really creative spirit within a team and frees you up to take greater creative risks than you could otherwise afford

1984510 for example i know that i cannot change my circumstances and therefore must proceed with the daily grind of life in other ways it becomes more difficult it is a very odd experience to be pregnant knowing that i may never get to bring my baby home from the hospital and that instead of anticipating his whole life i may have to prepare for his funeral and burial
1984511 had i not been so definitely opposed the option of abortion may have been the end of my story except for future psychiatric pills
1984512 i am sure that for many women abortion is strongly recommended in cases like mine especially if women do not have a strong belief about it originally
1984513 i say he must really be extraordinary to be discounting all medical theories with respect to chromosome gene results and his longevity
1984514 i tell him that even the doctors arent sure why hes lived so long most babies with these abnormalities self abort long before now and that he is special because of this i tell you this because i want you to know that despite the grim outlook i am carrying this baby as long as he will let me and will not be the killing hand

1984574 has become a top threat for oracle who has been so far considered the leader in databases
1984575 after the massive delays sql server 2005 had microsoft and especially ted kummert corporate vice president of microsofts data and storage platform division were pretty vocal that it wouldnt happen again kummert had said that future releases would ship on a 24 to 36 month cycle and end of summer is basically the outside limit of that window im pretty sure he didnt want to be made a liar in the first major release on his watch
1984576 an interesting question that well learn the answer to over the next few months is whether microsoft compromised quality to get the product out the door
1984577 the sql server team has traditionally been willing to take as long as they needed to make sure releases were solid at this point i dont think there is any particular reason to think microsoft cut corners but they definitely changed the development and test process and that always carries risks
1984578 interesting features for developers and administrators and some things that could help sql server continue its march up market

1984608 women and men from more affluent boroughs were perceived as being more physically attractive than individuals from less affluent boroughs

1984611 when you have a patient who is terminally ill in particular its usually the family who has the more unrealistic expectation of what can be done
1984612 thats a very difficult situation partly because of the angst you feel when they demand unnecessary tests for a patient that you know will only cause suffering and not do any good it eats at your heart you dont want to get angry at the family but you are angry at the family
1984613 life and death situations are very emotional for families and for physicians

1984633 we had heard that microsoft threw down a cool half billion to acquire danger earlier this year but quite honestly we found it a bit tough to believe after all analysts are saying that even motorola is barely worth that much regardless of all that the outfits latest quarterly report filed with the us securities and exchange commission affirms that it did indeed spend 500 million on danger thats a lot of jack son

1984640 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
1984641 the thing thats most interesting to me is the ongoing relationship with your audience that products are no longer just launched that theyre in a phase of constantly being launched
1984642 and i think that were just sort of catching up to that notion
1984643 i think you have to think about products as more like services more like a relationship between the audience and the world youre making rather than just shipping this thing then on to the next one
1984644 but i think that requires and weve thought about this some sophistication in your thinking about your franchise your business and the industry isnt entirely set up for that yet
1984645 but its exciting in every possible way its lets people build relationships with your products gives products longer lifespans lets you leverage aspects of the hardcore audience you cant leverage otherwise lets you not have as many people involved in the transaction there are benefits all around
1984646 the goal for our next project is something very different

1984661 cultural issues aside it will be an important test not just for whether one can deliver legal online music in china
1984662 as important to me as the piracy question is whether google can create a useful and compelling revenue stream off an ad supported service like this
1984663 if you think about what they could learn in terms of all the data traffic patterns and seeing how people in china find music online it will have long term implications
1984664 maybe what youll see is if chinese users find this alternative where the selection is broad and its convenient people might be willing to monetize that through their attention to online ads or direct payment for music over time
1984665 the music labels have been to a large degree eviscerated in terms of their traditional revenue model for the past several years
1984666 the labels have got to be thinking boy why shouldnt we
1984667 this is part of a strategic effort by google to build up its brand in china

1984672 bob sutor vp of open source and standards at ibm told attendees of the linuxworld conference in san francisco that what the open source community needs to make linux popular as a desktop os used by consumers and businesses are
1984673 stop copying 2001 windows thats not where the usability action is
1984674 the tools will be finalized at the same time that the new linux platform becomes available
1984675 it will allow developers to create applications that are highly portable that includes java web widgets and native linux applications we are focused on engaging more with developers as the limo specification becomes more complete
1984676 were completely open to making whatever contributions the members of limo would like to see
1984677 both sides have made significant contributions unlike a lot of standards efforts limo did not start with a full platform but rather with components so there are some pieces we have to take out and others we have to put in for example limo is based on gtk

1984679 with his exceptional ability to select and blend tracks gilles peterson has put together one of the best collections of latin music highlighting some of the finest gems from the prolific fania catalog of music
1984680 this is my first latin compilation and im proud of it i must have listened to 200 albums to get to this
1984681 these are all tried and tested cuts and some of finest moments from the collective of labels that were fania tico alegre and cotique
1984682 my guess is that samsung and microsoft are maybe working on the os recognizing an ssd with a 4k byte sector size instead of a hard disk drive with a 512 byte sector size
1984683 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
1984684 the economics i think are extremely favorable to us and to the industry generally
1984685 we just write better were really clever i think it comes down to really good writing a lot of times when i read page six i dont know who half of those people are i feel like if i dont know who they are maria gonzalaz riding the a train to work isnt going to know who they are socialites are not celebrities to me theyre not important and theyre not newsworthy
1984686 the new york post puts page six within the first 10 pages of the paper but the daily news puts rush and molloy much further back gossip sells so why not move it up to the front of the paper like page six
1984687 i think the post does that because everything in the post is pretty boring and irrelevant they have nothing else to promote except the gossip column i think the rest of our articles are really good

1984714 we know for a fact that we will reduce the number of highway fatalities
1984715 gang bangers are killers they are murderers they are engaged in criminal enterprises and they are the cause of most of the crime that exists in illinois today
1984716 i prefer the old fashioned way you see a police officer of something like that you automatically know you need to slow down
1984717 speed enforcement cameras work they enforce the existing laws they keep honest law abiding citizens safer on the highway they reduce in a dramatic way the number of fatalities that occur on our highways
1984718 it seems that we have got a lot of selling based on the stronger dollar
1984719 energy demand destruction and the dollar return have formed a quiet alliance to bring the oil market down and today the louder of the two is the dollar
1984720 the market has been ignoring the tbilisi pipeline situation and now the problems with russia the move lower really now has a momentum of its own with the financial players coming out

1984726 who could throw all of these resources behind a single investigation

1984728 the academy was everything i hoped for and more i cant wait to plan out ways to use the tools we learned about to share my experiences with my colleagues and to re connect with the other academy participants
1984729 the focus on innovation in education and not just about the tools was right on target
1984730 i appreciate the opportunity to be connected to a group of educators that are passionate about preparing students for the 21st century i feel inspired and able to meet the challenges that lie ahead
1984731 until now i had never attended a conference where i was so engaged and loving every minute of it
1984732 this was easily the most important professional development experience i have ever had as an educator world class tools demonstrated by world class people at a world class facility thank you
1984733 i love the google certified teacher community for the ideas and inspiration that comes flowing to and from it folks share professional development strategies technology or otherwise that have worked its nice to have a variety of ways to assist others and having that variety also provides spice for those of us responsible for doing the providing

1984742 there is no such thing as an open source business model
1984743 what open source can learn from microsoft and the proprietary world
1984744 provides more flexibility and functionality for advertisers and marketers to understand search behavior and adds some cool new features like a world heat map to graphically display search volume and regional interest
1984745 on insights for search you can look at keywords and phrases or brands disambiguate them by category and look at them by date ranges and locations
1984746 it also gives you queries that are related to your umbrella search term and queries that are rising queries things that may be tied into a brand or product or concept that may be quickly ascending in their volume
1984747 it really is just a single input into a process of decision making for manufacturers and marketers but its an interesting window into consumer interest and demand as well as a reflection of whats going on more generally
1984748 this gives you in more or less real time and on a fairly massive scale insight into what people are looking for
1984749 i think what were seeing is that if companies are spending on adwords they want to correlate the returns not just by guessing but with better data
1984750 this eliminates some of the guesswork and enables people to test out their marketing hypotheses to see where the results are coming from
1984751 the idea is for google to provide more value to its ad customers no doubt not only so they can better tune their ads but also so they can increasingly come to google as the trusted source for the information they need

1984769 in the time of sakharov and solzhenitsyn there was a big and brutal system
1984770 it was simpler to define who was an angel and who was a devil

1984774 i myself cried this morning when i heard the news
1984775 the value of this law is not so much that police will seize your guns
1984776 it gives police a system to investigate a person who poses a threat if the police never confiscate a persons guns they can at least look into the persons behavior and perhaps prevent a tragedy by intervening
1984777 state police and 53 police departments have seized more than 1 700 guns opponents of that gun seizure law expressed fears in 1999 that police would abuse the law today the laws backers say the record shows that hasnt been the case

1984782 an invisible army of seattleites that want to make city life better
1984783 when i see a flagged intersection to me its a statement that we dont have to wait for permission to solve our problems
1984784 i think these wildcat flags going up come from a real sense of frustration that its taken the city so long to do anything
1984785 after july 4 i saw a bunch of american flags at the qfc
1984786 the ones near bars tend to disappear on a friday or saturday night
1984787 he was waving two flags like some sort of neon bat
1984788 there are so many electronic devices its not like a small town old school way of life where people look around and look for people they know and wave
1984789 i think a lot of people just dont want to know theyre supposed to stop
1984790 i dont think there been any secret with that cito is definitely going to be back
1984791 well sit down at the right time he has done a good job here were six games over 500 23 17 since he took over and weve got a long way to go weve got a long way to go offensively but he has really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively guys like playing for him we were just fortunate he was there we were just really lucky that no one else had hired him he was the right guy at the right time we never had any doubts hed be back
1984792 j p is entitled to make his comments i feel good about cito
1984793 we have an understanding were going to talk at end of season
1984794 i have to tell you cito has created a great buzz with the team on and off the field the fans love him i havent seen too many media guys taking shots at him the players obviously love him im pretty positive about things ill speak to cito right after the season ends i like what ive seen so far
1984795 i think were real close here weve just got to get some guys back who are on the dl and maybe if we can add here or there we certainly have a chance to make a run in the al east id like to be a part of it
1984796 i have a soft spot for older guys anyway but he has been absolutely great

1984799 microsoft developed this release of sql server with the customer in mind
1984800 sql server 2008 is the only major database that includes comprehensive tightly integrated functionality for data management as well as advanced business intelligence out of the box by offering a complete solution we save customers time and money and allow them to focus on deriving the most value from their data assets
1984801 with more than 450 000 downloads of sql server 2008s community technology previews ctps over 75 large scale applications already in production and over 1350 applications being developed by nearly 1000 isvs world wide we know this is a rock solid release
1984802 the gains weve seen from the integration of full text into the database engine enable us to consolidate our search platform onto fewer servers sql server 2008s increased performance along with the reduction in licensing costs makes upgrading a no brainer
1984803 we saw a 35 percent improvement in throughput on the system that we upgraded to sql server 2008 with no code changes on our end
1984804 this translates straight to the bottom line for us as the more documents we can upload the more we can process
1984805 theres no simple explanation some companies seem to figure no one is watching so they can get away with it
1984806 v ra aktie gare ska vara glada att vi ifr gas tter v ra fakturor och inte bara betalar i blindo
1984807 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out
1984808 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many license holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the license to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
1984809 for me i just kind of thought that wed never manage it never quite make it
1984810 but the feelings not too bad really its what its like as a games developer you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype ive had what four or five things that never happened its funny that we dont even talk about them a lot of the time because you think well we might revisit it
1984811 the balls not in anybody at rares court really its squarely in the license holders courts its a shame its kind of locked in this no mans land theres nothing on live arcade theres nothing on wii
1984812 its just what happens legally sometimes not necessarily with games but you see it with music and films things get locked in this legal limbo even most of the parties involved probably all the parties involved want to solve it its such a complex issue
1984813 terrorism and violent extremism are shrouded in secrecy and are taboo subjects for many young people today
1984814 whilst they are faced with a barrage of information about terrorism on the internet or through the media all too often they feel they hit a wall of silence when it comes to discussing the issue openly in schools universities and with the police
1984815 young people have expressed a profound interest in these issues and therefore it is vital that they are given a platform to share their experiences opinions and feelings with their peers and decision makers

1984818 while the exit market remains challenged the venture industry is operating under the same long term philosophy it has adhered to historically venture firms are prepared to invest for 5 to 10 years and will stick with their companies through difficult times that said for the remainder of the year we will be watching first time funding levels which declined this quarter this dynamic could very well be the result of the closed ipo window and will become concerning if the situation is prolonged
1984819 the first pictures i saw of him when he didnt have any glasses on didnt look anything like him
1984820 but the pictures after he was apprehended with the glasses those look just like him
1984821 we have been informed about the case by the u s authorities and we are checking possible connections to germany at the moment
1984822 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
1984823 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
1984824 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
1984825 he just thought he was better than anybody else and he could do anything and there was no way to stop him
1984826 he claimed to be a german student and i think he had already finished
1984827 we just figured out everything was not what it was
1984828 hes not in the yearbook theres no record of him theres no footprint of him but he was there
1984829 it cleans up their dumpsters too because they dont have all of that sticky stuff and the smell is much better too
1984830 this is where it all begins diverting food remnants from the waste stream reducing carbon emissions producing powerful soil amendments and plant foods and making products that replace environmentally destructive petrochemical fertilizers
1984831 i know that inafune san and i are both huge proponents of the pc platform and capcom is an active participant in the pcga we do believe in the future of the platform and that contrary to what retail data shows it is growing
1984832 our rosy prognostications aside somewhere the p amp ls of capcom japans outings on the platform are going to come up and they are likely to have a bearing on the decision making process for future titles
1984833 thats my long winded way of saying stay tuned because its not clear yet
1984834 i said to him you albanians want to join the eu and from what i know the english and the americans respect private property very much i dont want yours i just want my own back and nobody can deny me that
1984835 i have never lived in a village i know nothing about agriculture i am ill
1984836 if we agreed to be relocated to a village enclave somewhere we know that we like the other idps internally displaced persons would never get our home back
1984837 we know that we are like a thorn in the side for the greek camp because as long as we are here we are a problem they have to resolve

1984842 combine the two titles and make one super awesome movie
1984843 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel
1984844 its easy to underestimate the importance of search in our everyday lives
1984845 thus the movie opens with inane fake trailers to introduce its fictional stars surpassing the ones in
1984846 he returns to the movie within a movie within a movie metafilter so many times that the gimmick forces you to pay close attention and believe in the events as they transpire without sacrificing the absurd edge of the equation jumping back and forth between grossmans office and the jungle tropic thunder recalls the comical dread of dr strangelove where stanley kubrick cut between the war room and a nuke wielding b 52 this one could have the subtitle how i learned to stop worrying and love the blockbuster
1984847 the ground truth is just that the sales numbers on the pc are not what they used to be and are not what they are on the consoles
1984848 we still think the pc is a market worth supporting but were not making decision around the pc its probably more of the junior partner in the cross platform strategy although obviously our day to day development is predominately on the pc

1984858 green is hot we developed a breakthrough drtv campaign that instantly tapped into the insatiable demand for green products that save money on the consumers sky rocketing energy costs
1984859 the market is hungry for information about products that not only save money but also promote sustainability rather than simply selling a product the campaign sendtec designed aims to first educate the consumer on how it is now financially feasible to enjoy the benefits of solar energy in the home sendtec is gearing up to market other green products this year and expects similar successes
1984860 combining advanced technology with the easiest to implement package on the market power save has made solar energy a viable and affordable solution for the masses
1984861 by leveraging an in depth knowledge of drtv sendtec has been an invaluable partner in spreading our message
1984862 where the girls are growing up female with the mass media
1984863 the sneering dismissal of this violent radical moment for so many girls needs to stop like now
1984864 the shame that is beaten into teeny boppers when they grow up and are taught how humiliating it is to have been a huge hanson fan or something is a damaging cultural phenom
1984865 i read somewhere ill be damned if i recall where tho i think it may have been in bust or in the bust book a theory that the reason pre teen girls obsess over pop stars is becos its a totally safe way to begin to explore your sexuality you have this lust object but you dont have to actually kiss them or have sex with them since you cant actually meet them
1984866 i was left with an amazing movie trilogy and even better books beatles fans got some of the best music on the planet but what about the jonas brothers fangirls theyll have nothing but colorful posters and shame
1984867 what is it about those teen years that creates such a capacity for obsessive religious like worship of mediocre bands i mean even if they were the best musicians dancers ever and total heartthrobs would it really constitute sitting out on the nyc sidewalk for fifteen hours on the hottest night ever
1984868 why are those teenage girls so crazy irrational overemotional and deluded as to like these bands that i in my position of superiority and inherent objectivity deem mediocre i mean even if we control for the inherent weakness of their feeble brains to sex appeal their actions are let me repeat crazy irrational overemotional and deluded
1984869 i had a religion professor in college who told us about how he once saw jimi hendrix in concert the feel of the group was so intense and the mass crowd was just incredibly alluring and overpowering he said watching him play was kind of like being brainwashed
1984870 when im president of the united states ill call them back into session and ill keep them there until they get the work done

1984889 were certainly disappointed that kline lost his election bid and more than likely the criminal charges brought against planned parenthood will be dropped by steve howe and guinn
1984890 both of them are supported by planned parenthood and the big abortion money
1984891 there are some causes that are worth losing for and in that there is no defeat
1984892 although we are disappointed we are not deterred we have several other backup plans that we are working on right now
1984893 planned parenthood and other abortion providers are breaking the law flagrantly and we are going to be here until this battle ends and that will be noticed by the fact that no more children are dying

1984897 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics the hemisphere layout of the electronic eye eliminates this and other limitations thereby providing improved imaging characteristics
1984898 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities

1984903 frankie was on the phone to wish all the boys the best of luck and to tell them despite his disappointment he will be cheering them on on the television
1984904 its going to be painful for frankie but hes been a part of the team for a long time now and hes still a part of it i wouldnt expect anything less of frankie to support the team even though hes on the other side of the world
1984905 frankie will undoubtedly be a motivating factor i have told the lads they have got to concentrate on their own games now but they told me to a man they are now even more determined to do it for frankie
1984906 its an unseeded draw and it has not been kind to us all the team have proved they can beat the best in the world and they will have to do it again

1984918 though we dont think this type of advertising is appropriate for college sports we have tried this once before in this country and it didnt work very well
1984919 beer promotion during college sports telecasts undermines the best interests of higher education and compromises the efforts of colleges and others to combat sometimes epidemic levels of alcohol problems on many campuses today
1984920 we find it puzzling that ncaa advertising rules prohibit ads for cigarettes other tobacco products organizations promoting gambling and alcoholic beverages yet continue to allow ads for beverages with alcohol content of 6 percent or less beer the top alcoholic drink of college students
1984921 given the devastating problems caused by underage and excessive drinking much of it in the form of beer this policy makes little sense and flouts the core values of sports and learning
1984922 i think weve taken a very sensible very rationale very conservative approach and weve asked that any company that advertises alcohol during our games continue to include the message drink responsibly on its ads
1984923 i think weve taken about as a conservative an approach as any sport in the country while not everyone agrees 100 percent i think we represent what is a good balance in that opinion
1984924 our bylaws lump together names images and likenesses and the names are being used now so well have to go back and look at this
1984925 we will need to go back and look at our options we certainly are not giving up our model of amateurism
1984926 they engage in an ongoing pattern of serious crimes that we ignore at our peril

1984946 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
1984947 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee

1984949 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1984950 i think the most obvious reason that square enix made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console i mean were the leading console on a worldwide basis were more than double the install base on the us
1984951 i think its easy to assume that something is going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360

1984985 the government and its vast workforce serve the people the idea is so deep in the american grain that we cant bring ourselves to question it even in this disillusioned age
1984986 fantastic misgovernment of the kind we have seen is not an accident nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society

1985002 the movie uses money to define wealth but makes people question just what it is they are contributing to in their quest to achieve it in india some people have very little but still consider themselves wealthy in the west being an economic superpower people are taught to equate money with wealth and status
1985003 having been brought up in the west is always a challenge for me success is always evaluated by what you have if you have 100 you want 1000 and it just keeps growing from there at times i find myself getting caught up in that
1985004 i can relate to amal in being content in what you do in life my career as an actor has brought me happiness and personal satisfaction however the interesting thing about amal is he is totally in the moment i always have believed that one should live in the moment and always be content in what you do
1985005 i hope that it starts a dialogue between people i think it is tough to say that a 2 hour film will automatically change the way people live their lives but if a film can cause a discussion i think that is a great starting place

1985011 barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas
1985012 we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1985013 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
1985014 now im just speaking for myself and not the geological survey
1985015 but we are going to need almost anything you can think of all energy sources alternatives and technologies to get us through what paris doesnt talk about is that the electricity to power those hybrid and electric cars is going to have to come from somewhere too
1985016 see what youve done youve got me analyzing paris hiltons thought process
1985017 if she can articulate it it cant be rocket science
1985018 but the candidates dont come out and sum it up this way because their messages are one built around sound bites two built around oversimplification three built around interest groups

1985024 we want to make it as easy to install software on the ubuntu server as it is to install the ubuntu desktop for example were getting ready to release db2 and informix database management systems that come as deb packages which will install and do basic set up with only a couple of clicks or a single command line instruction
1985025 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
1985026 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
1985027 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
1985028 however is that the result of the rfs mandate our conclusion is no
1985029 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
1985030 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
1985031 todays ruling will allow farmers to continue to plan for and meet the fuel and food needs of the future
1985032 the epa realized that the facts clearly stood in ethanols corner the bottom line is that ethanol is extending our fuel supply and actually lowering gas prices

1985044 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
1985045 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
1985046 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
1985047 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
1985048 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
1985049 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
1985050 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
1985051 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them

1985058 what prevented me from leaving immediately was that we were surrounded by a pen with a 3 foot high bar over it
1985059 the operations manager said we had two choices tow the boat and ring to ensenada or try to use the seiners to push down on the edges of the net to give se or hefe a chance i was pushing them to letting me get over the side again but as some point in time they decided it was too risky for them
1985060 i knew the minute the patrol boat showed up that it would start getting dicey
1985061 the pen operators told us in the morning that they had informed the mexican authorities about what was going on and that at some point in time theyd show up on scene when they did show up they came with guns slinging
1985062 they were standing on deck with guns drawn and bulletproof vests on basically telling me they were going to board the boat
1985063 when the mexican naval patrol boat showed up they were circling the pen trying figure out how to get at us saying theyre going to board my boat
1985064 luckily theres a 20 foot gap between the pens perimeter and
1985065 i told the coast guard that id just created 100 000 to 150 000 in damage and that i feared for my life id heard all the stories about americans getting jailed murdered or having to pay bribes
1985066 once they board me thats control and im seeing myself in handcuffs on a one way trip to ensenada i wasnt going into ensenada i knew i had to keep a buffer zone between us and them
1985067 a few minutes earlier the gunboat had pulled away from us
1985068 all the crew went belowdecks removed their bulletproof vests and military uniforms and came back on the deck in t shirts i told the coast guard radioman that they must have been successful because now everybodys wearing t shirts
1985069 i just knew if the mexican naval crew got on board it would be a whole different ballgame
1985070 i told them point blank if they tried to board the boat id put it in gear and take my chances
1985071 by involving the coast guard in all conversations basically at some point in time it raised eyebrows on the mexican patrol boat they did not feel comfortable enough to hop on an inflatable to come alongside my boat
1985072 right as they cut through the third ring and the mexican boat was trying to lower the edge of the pen the coast guard helicopter arrived on scene and was in direct communication with us and the patrol boat
1985073 he came down and swooped right between us and the boarding party
1985074 the message was obvious they all kind of looked at each other and said what the heck it was gnarly nothing short of military might trying to flex its muscles
1985075 patrol boats in every nation have whats called the right of approach
1985076 we are bound by this in the united states if we want to board a vessel we have to ask a series of right of approach questions and obtain the masters consent
1985077 the mexican navy wanted to make sure the vessel was sound and not in danger of sinking at that point in time
1985078 we have a very good relationship with the mexican navy and we appreciate them providing a level of safety for se or hefe
1985079 what do you think would happen to me if i took my boat down to my normal fishing grounds in mexico
1985080 they would board my boat in an instant down there it would be pretty much stupid for me to hop on my boat and do a typical trip in mexican eez waters
1985081 right now theyre accusing me of negligent operation theyve hired an attorney and are claiming 300 000 to 400 000 in losses due to tuna pen damage labor in bringing another pen aside loss of five tons of fish and trauma to the fish even weeks later i think the fish loss is trumped up the damage to the rings is probably 8 000 to 10 000
1985082 we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety

1985088 we stand to greatly improve our models of fluid circulation and heat and mass transfer
1985089 temperatures are so high much of drilling equipment would melt and joins would not work anymore
1985090 the high temperature of the venting is especially interesting as this mid ocean ridge does not spread very rapidly
1985091 so one can presume that this portion of the south mid atlantic ridge is in a very magmatic phase and has been for a few years
1985092 the explanation could be that theres lot of magma but after a few more years of high temperatures its going to get to the point where it will be embarrassing how much magma there needs to be to maintain them for that long
1985093 if that turns out to be the case then we will have taken down some very very holy grails
1985094 an insightful way to define the critical temperature would be the temperature above which the phase of the material is independent of the pressure
1985095 came the cries of the much abused star wars fan base angrily shouted towards the heavens the heavens however remained silent until one day many years later they opened up and

1985111 its definitely a recruitment tool and the fact that its put out by the federal government and being funded from our tax dollars sounds illegal to me
1985112 im not exactly sure what the laws are but if it is being funded by our tax dollars we have the right to say hey stop taking our money and using it for stupid sh
1985113 protesters argue that the us army should not be using taxes to fund recruitment tools

1985132 when honest people are confronted with a false accusation they typically respond without caveats but frattos response is a far cry from a categorical denial that anything akin to what suskind describes took place indeed given recent white house history it more likely means we want this question to go away so were going to call it ridiculous and the statement sent out on behalf of the former cia officials raises more questions than it answers did they perhaps get such instructions from people out of their chain of command ideally all the people allegedly involved in this plot would be required to provide direct answers to some basic questions
1985133 any such notion that we would engage in that kind of activity is just absurd
1985134 we this white house it is absurd to suggest that this white house would seek to punish someone for speaking out with a different view we welcome people with different views thats a healthy part of our democracy
1985135 ive made it very clear that it was a ridiculous suggestion in the first place
1985136 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1985137 there are elements in pakistan that worries one that there are connections to the militants in the region
1985138 there are also clearly efforts that we think are not working to have deals if you will or negotiated solutions to the militant problem
1985139 but the point is that these militants are as deadly and dangerous for pakistan as they are for afghanistan just witness the fact that one of the networks there is widely believed to be responsible for the assassination of former pakistan premier benazir bhutto
1985140 a country that built up the taliban a country that sponsors terrorism against india
1985141 and by the way the pakistanis themselves understand that they need to take a bolder stand again this is a threat not just to us or to afghanistan but to them
1985142 this has been rooting in pakistan for a long time and its going to take a while to expel extremism
1985143 very clear that something has to be done about terrorists who are using pakistani territory to run cross border raids into afghanistan
1985144 the problem is that yes the taliban has regrouped but not really regrouped in as a military force but rather in kind of hit and run terrorist incidents that in fact do affect the population
1985145 and so a couple of things need to be done afghan forces need to be trained in larger numbers and faster the problems across the afghan pakistan border have to be dealt with
1985146 i had a previous abortion at age 21 and it wasnt this hard it didnt seem like a baby to me at that age but after raising two children i know now that i really did lose a living being inside me

1985160 she got out this morning i dont know what time
1985161 but i got a call to say one of your monkeys is on the road we went down with the quad and a net and caught her straight away
1985162 she was tired and completely disorientated someone had pulled up in a jeep and given her a banana so she was eating that
1985163 we got a call from a female motorist and initially we thought it might be a hoax we found it very odd but we have to look at all things that come in
1985164 by 8 35am we found out there was a place nearby that keeps monkeys so we thought it could be true
1985165 by 8 45am the gardai in bray confirmed there was a monkey on the road but he was caught caged and cleared by 9am
1985166 there have been no escapes like this before ive had few birds escaping but nothing as exotic as that

1985168 on the advice of the hon chief minister thiru n k k p raja minister for handlooms is relieved from the cabinet with immediate effect
1985169 the subjects handlooms and textiles hitherto held by n k k p raja are reallocated to thiru k k s s r ramachandran minister for backward classes in addition to the subjects held by him
1985170 in respect of the case filed in the high court against thiru n
1985171 on enquiry about the incident it has come to light that a case has been filed that sampathkumar secretary of aiadmk labour union and one sundararajan have attempted to occupy the lands forcibly at the instigation of the minister since there appears to be a basis for the above allegation against the minister thiru raja is relieved from his ministerial responsibilities until the verdict of the court is known
1985172 i have caused enquiries through appropriate official channels the enquiry has revealed that the report that thiru t m anbarasan labour minister is protecting an accused in a murder case by the name kumar who is wanted by the police is false it is also clearly known that the minister is in no way preventing the arrest of the accused
1985173 there is no prima facie for the case registered against thiru suresh rajan under the sc and st prevention of atrocities act i do not rely on this accusation since he has been an ardent follower of dravidian movement right from his younger days
1985174 but for years the advice was to always decline this waiver because you have it covered between your credit card and your own insurance

1985188 is the biggest proponent of george bushs tired failed policies ready to bring about change another day brings another dishonest attack from john mccain while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families

1985214 frankly our job is to win the war part of that is information warfare so we are going to attempt to dominate the information environment
1985215 whatever is told to you about war and how we must go to war and whatever the threat is or whatever the goal is a democracy or liberty it will always be a war against children theyre the ones who will die in large numbers
1985216 essentially an evil thing to initiate a war of aggression is not only an international crime it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole
1985217 with evidence having emerged that marines were ordered by superiors to massacre women and children in haditha in iraq two years ago combined with scores of other testimonies and reports of such barbaric demands being forced upon american troops daily it is clear that organised execution and ritual slaughter is the set policy of the architects of aggression in the middle east
1985218 everything we do is important every little thing we do every picket line we walk on every letter we write every act of civil disobedience we engage in any recruiter that we talk to any parent that we talk to any gi that we talk to any young person that we talk to anything we do in class outside of class everything we do in the direction of a different world is important even though at the moment they seem futile because thats how change comes about change comes about when millions of people do little things which at certain points in history come together and then something good and something important happens

1985251 the west in our days the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society of course there are many courageous individuals but they have no determining influence on public life

1985320 i am a friend of india and a supporter of u s india nuclear cooperation yet i find it incomprehensible that the administration apparently intends to seek or accept an exemption from the nsg guidelines for india with few or none of the conditions contained in the henry j hyde act
1985321 an exemption inconsistent with the u s law will place american firms at a severe competitive disadvantage and undermine critical u s non proliferation objectives it will also jeopardise congressional support for nuclear cooperation with india in future
1985322 in your appearance before the foreign affairs committee on february 13 of this year you assured me that any nsg decision will have to be completely consistent with the obligations of the hyde act

1985326 this is just ryanairs way of extracting more money from customers it seems the airline can do whatever they like and no one can stop them
1985327 the real issue here in our view is that ryanair is concerned about losing out on the sale of other services such as travel insurance hotels car hire and to stop this they want to prevent consumers from using comparison websites
1985328 genuine passengers using ryanairs website have been suffering long processing times and slower access because of the huge volume of information being downloaded from our website by these screenscrapers all over rescue

1985392 until the 1970s the editors were picked on the basis of grades and the president of the law review was the student with the highest academic rank among these were elliot l richardson the former attorney general and irwin griswold a dean of the harvard law school and solicitor general under presidents lyndon b johnson and richard m nixon that system came under attack in the 1970s and was replaced by a program in which about half the editors are chosen for their grades and the other half are chosen by fellow students after a special writing competition the new system disputed when it began was meant to help insure that minority students became editors of the law review
1985393 mr obama succeeds peter yu a first generation chinese american as president of the law review after graduation mr yu plans to serve as a clerk for chief judge patricia wald on the of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit

1985395 mr obama was elected after a meeting of the reviews 80 editors that convened sunday and lasted until early this morning a participant said
1985396 mr obama was the most prominent minority student on a campus shaken by racial politics a group agitating for greater faculty diversity occupied the deans office and sued the school for discrimination derrick bell a black law professor resigned over the issue the law review struggled to decide whether affirmative action should factor into the selection of editors and how much voice to give to critical race theorists who argued that the legal system was inherently biased against minorities
1985397 the president of the law review usually goes on to serve as a clerk for a judge on the federal court of appeals for a year and then as a clerk for an associate justice of the supreme court mr obama said he planned to spend two or three years in private law practice and then return to chicago to re enter community work either in politics or in local organizing
1985398 ah yes when i clerked with judge so and so
1985399 re enter community work either in politics or in local organizing
1985400 that system came under attack in the 1970s and was replaced by a program in which about half the editors are chosen for their grades and the other half are chosen by fellow students after a special writing competition the new system disputed when it began was meant to help insure that minority students became editors of the law review

1985407 given how the local leftymedia has harped on barb davis white s religion especially its anti gay aspects just as they do for every republican politician who is open about a faith that doesn t aggressively embrace homosexuality why has nobody in the leftymedia asked rep ellison the way they ask barb davis white and michele bachmann to pick two random examples about how his religion the very anti gay islam affects his views on homosexuality

1985417 campaign spokesman abe rakov ray kov says madia just found out about the suspended license and is moving quickly to reinstate it rakov says the expiration was an oversight
1985418 state court records say madia is not currently authorized to practice law
1985419 the records say his license expired on july 1 and his last payment was made in june 2007
1985420 if ashwin madia cant keep his own legal affairs in order how on earth are minnesota voters supposed to trust him to write their laws
1985421 ashwin madia doesnt seem to have any problems remembering the birthday of scandal scarred congressman charlie rangel thats probably because there is a financial benefit to his campaign
1985422 i assume you all were equally upset at mark kennedy for having an inactive cpa license in 2006 especially after he claimed the senate could use a cpa thanks im anxious to here your replies
1985423 yeah and the lefts description of the employee free choice act didnt jive with the actual text of the act but that didnt stop people from repeating lies in hopes one day it would become true

1985438 i would have thought this was a matter of common sense i have certainly seen more people on the buses with prams than in a wheelchair
1985439 but of course parents choose to put their child in a traditional pram and wheelchair users dont have a choice so if a driver lets a mother on and three stops down the road a wheelchair user gets on the wheelchair user should take priority
1985440 that requires goodwill on the parents behalf but im sure most parents would understand the situation and there would also be pressure from other passengers
1985441 were starting a letter writing campaign weve asked everybody in the facebook group to write we never really wanted this to become a big issue but we just want them to come to a better agreement

1985443 in order to ensure that wheelchairs can be accommodated on our vehicles we are unable to carry prams as they cannot be folded
1985444 we can however carry one unfolded buggy if the wheelchair space is unoccupied
1985445 i have only used the card a handful of times since the ban on prams was enforced
1985446 this whole situation has caused me a lot of distress and upset i have been unable to see friends and get around the city with ease

1985469 yes yes sir ive a particularly good chateau leoville barton
1985470 smith institute rumoured to take over ippr in radical new merger
1985471 make a clear decision for a start and stick to it as professionals we dont float proposals to our customers we make a decision and get it out there
1985472 clearly hello big boy routine ive just been to la perla
1985473 worked hard to ensure that the appropriate number of staff accompany him
1985474 we had a brilliant report from the commission which concluded there had been absolutely nothing in any of the allegations made against us as a result of which i can now stand down
1985475 no hes hitlers not in our game weve got to save something for future wolfensteins
1985476 thats one of the cool things again about the wolfenstein universe we go back and we pull some of these things from real history and spin this what if story for some of it and some of it just kind of blows out
1985477 the kreisau circle originally is more of a group of aristocrats working behind the scenes in hopes to overthrow hitler here theyre gun toting resistance forces fighting on the streets but its kind of nice to take those elements have a framework of reality and build it out
1985478 getting more and more pressure from dollar strength and it doesnt seem reversible for now
1985479 it used to be a high security prison but is something much worse than that now

1985481 proud to see his penis 25ft tall its enormous massive
1985482 when the photos came out she was the first to call me and say what are you doing
1985483 the beckham campaign has certainly had an impact on sales
1985484 mens underwear styles are constantly evolving of late the current mens underwear trend is for lots of colour like with the bright and bold 70s retro prints of the new
1985485 theres no other way to put it your pants no longer provide adequate support
1985486 when ive discussed this with friends and acquaintances it has revealed widespread gusset anxiety
1985487 ive always been a briefs boy and always will be
1985488 i dont understand boxer shorts i dont know who they work for the brief is a much sexier look
1985489 mens underwear is like womens bras they have to do a job and from a fashion and a functional point of view briefs do a better job
1985490 for example sportsmen always go with the brief because it holds you where you need to be held which is why using beckham and freddie ljungberg in adverts is very savvy i think the old fashioned baggy cotton boxer short era is over these days it has to be the brief or the boxer brief
1985491 the attitude is if youve got it flaunt it but with briefs and tight pants it all comes back to body shape
1985492 lets face it we dont all have a toned and chiselled body like beckham and you really need that to be able to carry off tight briefs no one needs to see an irish beer belly pouring out over a pair of penneys briefs
1985493 personally i prefer fitted boxer briefs which are low slung tight fitting but longer on the leg so they retain their masculinity
1985494 the upside of briefs is that they accentuate your best assets holding everything neatly in place
1985495 you can now purchase briefs that give your bum a slight lift and even make you look like youre packing more downstairs than you actually are
1985496 the effects of overuse are generally unmistakable you cant miss the empty nets of fishing boats working overfished oceans or the scrub that covers an overgrazed field but the effects of underuse created by too much ownership are often invisible theyre mainly things that dont happen inventions that dont get made useful drugs that never get to market
1985497 intellectual property is to the digital age what physical goods were to the industrial age barack obama believes we need to update and reform our copyright and patent systems to promote civic discourse innovation and investment while ensuring that intellectual property owners are fairly treated
1985498 property rights including patents are essential to economic growth providing incentives to innovate and invest but property rights need to be limited to be effective the more we divide common resources like science and culture into small fenced off lots heller shows the more difficult we make it for people to do business and to build something new innovation investment and growth end up being stifled
1985499 will play a more direct role in forging or derailing change than montana
1985500 the down side is that her presence could act as an incentive for wavering republican supports to turnout and vote mccain
1985501 why would the obama campaign want a rockstar for a vp when they have rockstar already
1985502 who can you imagine going for a quiet pint with
1985503 it is also suggests that the european gendarmerie force egf which currently only involves france italy spain portugal and the netherlands should become an eu body
1985504 a lot of democrats are moaning about the fact that barack obama has not been answering john mccains attack ads with negative ads of his own for example focusing on mccains relationship with convicted felon charles keating but there may be a strategic reason for this silence mccain has opted in for public financing which means be must spend all his primary money during the primary season which ends the day he is formally nominated otherwise he loses the money obama opted out and has no such restrictions so obama is spending a lot of money now on voter registration and is saving money for running ads in the fall when many more people are tuned in
1985505 i asked barack what he wanted for his birthday and he said three things indiana colorado and virginia

1985526 a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag
1985527 these people define themselves as obama fanatics and they are alas rather superficial they fall for a one word slogan change they faint in cool weather just because their middle aged heart throb is near are you one of them
1985528 they faint in cool weather just because their middle aged heart throb is near

1985557 the first half of 2008 has been as difficult an operating environment as we have encountered for some time presenting both general and specific challenges to rbs
1985558 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs
1985559 we are determined to ensure that the inherent strengths of the groups diverse business model are not obscured in this way again
1985560 it has been a chastening experience and reporting a pre tax loss of 692m is something i and my colleagues regret very much
1985561 maybe the chairman sir tom mckillop probably will be the one that will have to fall on his sword and simply because the ceo sir fred goodwin removing him would be too disruptive to the organisation at this time and its just not responsible to do so
1985562 so if the investors want someones head they will probably go after the chairmans
1985563 so much of the bad news was already in the public domain and it is not necessarily losses it is non performing assets that are causing these figures and they may come back on in the coming years
1985564 it is difficult to see exactly how exposed it is in many ways banks estimate the worst so it can be better than it appears
1985565 the shareholders are disgruntled but there is no point kicking out the board they got it into this mess so they can get it out
1985566 rbs has a significant equity stake in a number of developers in edinburgh and we know that they are already under pressure from rbs to release some of their capital sell assets and cut costs
1985567 if rbs is making losses and cutting costs then they will want to pass on some of the pain to these firms the second half of the year will be very difficult for a number of people nobody will be buying land schemes will be put on ice and the whole market in the city will be very sluggish
1985568 inevitably there is a fear that if a business comes under increasing pressure it will look to cut its cost base we hope that will not happen here because the royal bank has proven itself to be a front runner
1985569 hopefully in taking the hit this year they will be clearing the way to do well in the future
1985570 we have no fundamental concerns in the scottish economy of course staff like everybody will be concerned about the performance and financial situation
1985571 behind these figures are thousands of families facing sleepless nights worrying about how to make their next mortgage payment and many thousands more will be waking up to the frightening reality of repossession
1985572 government urgently needs to step in to prevent thousands more families from losing their homes
1985573 we are focused here very much on doing whats right for our shareholders and to steer the business through a difficult time
1985574 we have steered it through good times and we are going to steer it through these times

1985600 a chinese language blog responsible for leaking photographs of a genuine next generation apple 15 inch macbook pro casing has posted a similar set of photos purported to be that of the companys upcoming aluminum 13 inch macbooks
1985601 the four photos below published by apple pro show a hollow 13 inch aluminum notebook display casing with the word macbook imprinted on the bezel
1985602 last month the same blog published a single photo showing the empty shell of what was said to be apples next gen macbook pro enclosure people familiar with the upcoming notebooks later confirmed to appleinsider that the enclosure in the photo was indeed authentic
1985603 a relative newcomer to covering apples financial health ubs investment research is beginning its examination of the electronics firm with a positive outlook on the stickiness of the companys brands but also the assertion that it has had to delay shipping a new ultra mobile mac
1985604 analyst maynard um echoes analyst reports and leaks that anticipate new macs including a revamped macbook line and ipods in the second half of 2008 but cites industry checks which point to a sub notebook originally intended for this year but which has allegedly been pushed back to a launch for the first half of 2009
1985605 you can never be sure what advances will find their way into the next round of apple hardware updates until practically the moment cupertino makes the big announcement but that doesnt mean its not fun to guess a little bit
1985606 soon after intels recent announcement of its new centrino 2 mobile platform rumors began to circulate about what would be inside apples next round of macbook and macbook pro laptops which are themselves rumored to be refreshed in the near future
1985607 so what can you expect in the next round of apple laptops
1985608 the rumorosphere has come up with five competing scenarios for the new apple laptops apple may as shrout contends switch to an nvidia chipset and keep the intel processor apple may dump intel entirely and adopt an amd processor and a chipset from amds 2006 acquisition ati apple may stick with an intel processor but switch to an ati chipset apple may stick with intel for both processor and chipset embarrassing all the rumormongers apple may stick with intel processors but design its own chipset much as the company did in the pre intel days
1985609 after my first article on macs and os x there were several readers who just down right bashed macs for pricing and os x without solid reasoning or legitimate hands on experience of macs so this is a follow up
1985610 lets get straight to the point toms hardware isnt about being a pc fanboy its about finding the best hardware revealing up and coming tech and debunking predetermined notions that begs the question especially here whats so special about a mac anyway
1985611 heres the short answer nothing really just some very elegant aluminum chassis designs the key is the operating system even still lets settle this issue about price
1985612 in a recent comment someone came up with an analogy that a mac isnt really a bmw but rather a hyundai dressed up in a nice exterior
1985613 you can always buy a cheaper car to get you from a to b instead lets see what you can get for 2000 from apple and from others for 2000 do you really get much less

1985778 but their analysis leaves at least a couple of questions insufficiently answered for one thing the authors ignore the fact that brains not only observe nature but also are part of nature perhaps the math that brains invent takes the form it does because math had a hand in forming the brains in the first place through the operation of natural laws in constraining the evolution of life furthermore its one thing to fit equations to aspects of reality that are already known its something else for that math to tell of phenomena never previously suspected when paul diracs equations describing electrons produced more than one solution he surmised that nature must possess other particles now known as antimatter but scientists did not discover such particles until after diracs math told him they must exist if math is a human invention nature seems to know what was going to be invented

1985872 much of the current canadian research has been aimed at understanding the characteristics of individuals who are at greatest risk of experiencing fear of crime
1985873 more recently research on american cities suggests that it may also be important to consider the neighbourhood context in attempting to understand patterns of fear of crime in canada for two reasons first some aspects of the social and economic conditions of neighbourhoods may be directly related to individuals behaviours and perceptions regardless of their own personal characteristics second individuals perceptions of the level of crime and social disorder in the neighbourhood i e perceived signs of incivilities such as prostitution drug addicts loitering vandalism etc may explain variations in levels of fear even after accounting for neighbourhood and individual characteristics
1985874 the aim of this study is to present information about the extent to which fear of crime differs across neighbourhoods in canadian urban areas and to assess whether the characteristics of individuals and or neighbourhoods explain this variation

1985895 so it comes down to one other question and thats the credibility of the person offering it if the associated press said they had spent a year figuring this out and they would verify the picture i would take it a little bit more seriously but this is the national enquirer saying weve got proof positive and their track record does not infuse you with an awful lot of enthusiasm
1985896 as far as its composition i cant tell its awful bad
1985897 well the national enquirer has finally delivered the goods in the form of spy photos revealing an edwards type figure hoisting aloft a remarkably human looking child
1985898 either you have a photo or you dont what appears above is basically a john edwards avatar cradling a cyber baby

1985922 we had three outstanding games and two less than outstanding games

1985932 the nano structure silicon thin film transistors are very promising for design of low power electronics however carrier transport in such devices is very complicated and results in electrical characteristics that may not be described by conventional field effect transistor fet models this work reveals the key physical properties of the devices which will help to further optimize and model the devices for circuit design
1985933 this study is a prime example of how leading silicon technologies entrenched in industry can find alternative routes to improve on performance in device characteristics by clever design the role that funding organizations such as epsrc play in supporting this type of applied research is invaluable to the community and most importantly to industry

1985968 i would like to apologize one more time to all the members and i would like to thank you for what you have done for me

1985979 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago

1985981 we welcome the iocs recognition of its role on human rights but given the current reality we are surprised at their confidence that foreign media will be able to report freely and that there will be no internet censorship
1985982 and they must speak out when the authorities violate the wider olympic principles
1985983 additionally world leaders who attend the games need to raise their voice publicly for human rights in china and in support of individual chinese human rights activists

1986006 apple on friday returned to its app store an application that makes it possible for iphone customers to use their high speed internet connections to provide web access to a pc
1986007 apple has not said why it took down the netshare iphone application thursday evening but the softwares creator nullriver confirmed that the application was available once again
1986008 were not quite sure why apple took down the netshare application yet weve received no communication from apple thus far nullriver said on its site
1986009 a tiny company called nullriver today released what is arguably one of the most useful iphone applications to date netshare with a tiny bit of configuring the 10 software allows you to share your iphones edge or 3g connection with your mac notebook or any computer in general weve compiled an illustrated 10 step guide that we hope will simplify the configuration process and provide an overview of the software for those who may be considering it as a purchase
1986010 on monday night i noticed that i had a small crack in my white iphone that went from the volume button to the metal bezel
1986011 when i went to the apple store to have a genius look at it they hadnt heard of or seen the problem before they wouldnt replace my iphone because it was not a known problem and it was just cosmetic
1986012 well i think it is a pretty well known issue now yesterday every iphone site and big sites like gizmodo and engadget picked up on the story
1986013 the cracks seem be be appearing in places where there is a metal piece which is encased by the plastic backing my crack formed where the volume button is some have appeared where there volume on off switch is some have appeared where the sleep wake button is and finally some have appeared where the headphone jack is i think that putting a slightest amount of pressure i e to lower or raise the volume turn your iphone on or off or even insert the headphones causes undue stress to the plastic backing eventually it is going to give out and crack
1986014 comparing the two new iphone software appears faster more responsive better contact handling and wont take an age to back up before sync see the two compared

1986022 the us military went into iraq with few troops able to speak arabic
1986023 if all this sounds very soldier friendly thats because the product was designed with the help of troops from the 10th mountain division who have been using 260 of these specially equipped ipods for the last year
1986024 the vcommunicator mobile software and libraries takes up four gigabytes per language so it can be used on the smaller and more rugged nano ipods the software displays graphics showing either the phrase in arabic or a video of a soldier making the appropriate hand gesture there are a lot of those in arabic there are collections of phrases for specific situations like checkpoint raid or patrol

1986034 its the future of mobile internet and mobile gaming as soon as we knew the rollout strategy for the new 3g iphone we decided to offer an iphone specific build of informatist the game uses the most realistic economic simulation engine to offer an enjoyable in depth yet intuitive gaming experience bringing the game to the iphone was the next logical step for our company
1986035 we believe we are the first multiplayer online business simulation game on the iphone platform
1986036 this is one of the reasons we have placed so much emphasis on configuring it for this specific platform and one which users will benefit from immediately

1986048 ceea ce i a facut sa abordeze problema a fost aceea ca senatorul mccain si a declarat intentia de a mentine fortele americane in irak pentru o suta de ani ceea ce inseamna ca mccain vrea sa controleze babilonul pentru cel putin un secol

1986058 unless they start invading and taking over the old soviet bloc nations there is no need to try to defeat the russians in any way best just to ignore them this time around

1986060 south ossetia is inhabited mostly by ethnic ossetians who speak a language remotely related to farsi georgians account for less than one third of the population

1986115 will boosting the housing market turn it round for brown
1986116 i will not allow house prices to get out of control and put at risk the sustainability of the recovery i have therefore decided it is right to take two measures aimed at stability in the housing market first i will raise stamp duty from 1 per cent to 1 5 per cent on property sales above 250 000 and to 2 per cent for property sales above 500 000 second continuing the reforms begun by the previous government which removed mortgage tax relief at the higher rate of 40 per cent in 1991 and cut it to 15 per cent by 1995 i propose to reduce mortgage tax relief by a further 5 per cent from 15 per cent to 10 per cent from april 1998 the timing of my measure should help to avoid a return to the conditions of the 1980s where the failure to take early action guaranteed worse problems later on i believe these measures will help to ensure a more balanced recovery

1986120 so what should mr mccain do hes rightly raising questions about mr obamas fitness to be president starting with his failure to admit that the surge in iraq worked
1986121 but to win mr mccain must also make a compelling case for electing john mccain voters trust him on terrorism and iraq and they see him as a patriot who puts country first
1986122 he needs to lay out a bold domestic reform program
1986123 he gave a taste on energy but with a few missteps he should appear in front of manufacturing plants where jobs depend on affordable energy small businesses affected by fuel prices and farms hurt by skyrocketing fertilizer costs and not in front of oil rigs he needs to describe the consequences of specific domestic policy decisions he must explain how his proposals on energy health care jobs and education will make a difference for ordinary families
1986124 mr mccain should also talk about issues that increase republican enthusiasm and win over independents such as earmarks and judicial activism and he should not shy away from appeals for bipartisanship
1986125 the mccain and obama campaigns are mirror opposites mr mccain offers little biography while mr obama is nothing but
1986126 the republican partys convention next month is mr mccains biggest chance to improve his posture
1986127 britain has one truly national resource the talent and potential of its people yet in britain today one in five of working age households has no one earning a wage in place of welfare there should be work the welfare state was and remains a great british achievement it was set up to provide security for all and opportunity for all goals as relevant today as in 1945 for millions out of work or suffering poverty in work the welfare state today denies rather than provides opportunity we should now take the necessary steps to create the new welfare state for the twenty first century first everyone in need of work should have the opportunity to work second we must ensure work pays third everyone who seeks to advance through employment and education must be given the means to advance starting from this year every young person aged 18 25 who is unemployed for more than six months will be offered a first step on the employment ladder there will be no option to stay at home on full benefit when they sign on for benefit they will be signing up for work benefits will be cut if young people refuse to take up the opportunities

1986138 whoever the leader is labour needs to seek to turn the election less into a referendum on the current government and more into a choice between governments but that also depends on voters believing there are substantive differences between the two parties clearly camerons strategy is effective in seeking to minimise these labour is a long way from achieving this that has been a particular weakness of browns strategy over the last 12 months

1986172 the video dated august 1 follows the posting of a similar video in july in which a group calling itself the turkistan islamic party tip claimed responsibility for bus bombings in shanghai and kunming capital of the southwestern province of yunnan
1986173 through this blessed jihad in yunnan this time the turkistan islamic party warns china one more time
1986174 our aim is to target the most critical points related to the olympics
1986175 terrorist group seeking an independent muslim state in western china has released a video threatening an attack on the olympic games
1986176 we members of the turkestan islamic party have declared war against china we oppose chinas occupation of our homeland of east turkestan which is a part of the islamic world
1986177 we do not want to see any muslim brothers and sisters who believe in allah and his holy prophet muhammad who believe in the next life and the day of judgment get hurt by our fire targeted at china
1986178 chinas best defence against the risk of a terrorist attack on the olympic games is its strict visa system now reinforced by worldwide police intelligence from the databases of interpol
1986179 chinas requirement that all foreign visitors obtain visas means they are screened well before they show up at its borders interpol secretary general ronald k noble said
1986180 its damn hard to get in here under a false identity said noble who was in beijing on friday for the opening of the games and its damn hard to get out of here without being controlled

1986198 public confidence demands that the court order a free and impartial inquiry into the case
1986199 if that protection is removed what will happen to the independence of the judiciary
1986200 cases will be filed against honest judges and they will be arrested and thrown in jails
1986201 the supreme court should not give the impression that it is trying to shield corrupt judicial officers
1986202 you have no respect for anybody not even one judge of the supreme court
1986203 but things should not have been allowed to go to this extent that a judge feels constrained to give up a matter and not go ahead with the case

1986208 hope that seven years from now we bring down the price which bushs energy department says it wouldnt do
1986209 rove baselessly claims eia agrees that oil drilling would bring down prices
1986210 we can help alleviate shortages by drilling for oil and gas in our own country
1986211 we have got the opportunity to find more crude oil here at home
1986212 assuming that world oil markets continue to work as they do today the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec could neutralize any potential price impact of anwr oil production by reducing its oil exports by an equal amount
1986213 we need a new car and we need it now
1986214 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups
1986215 thats right the eia writing in early 2007 assumed that oil prices would decline from their 2006 peak that in 2008 the price of crude oil would be around 60 a barrel that it would continue to decline until around 2013 to a low of about 50 a barrel and that the price would then gradually increase to a little under 60 a barrel by 2030 those were the assumptions on which eia concluded that it would not be economically profitable to get most ocs oil out of the ground
1986216 in the reference case increased non opec and opec supplies are expected to cause a price decline from 2006 levels to under 50 per barrel 2005 dollars in 2014 after that a gradual rise in oil prices averaging 1 1 percent per year in constant dollar terms or about 3 0 percent in nominal terms is expected through 2030 the aeo2007 reference case world oil price in 2030 is 59 per barrel in 2005 dollars or about 95 per barrel in nominal terms
1986217 the high and low oil price cases in aeo2007 are based on different assumptions about world oil supply the aeo2007 reference case uses the mean estimates of oil and natural gas resources published by the u s geological survey usgs 60 t
1986218 the aeo2007 reference case represents eias current best judgment regarding
1986219 when we read wildly inaccurate reporting in the mainstream media its often hard to tell whether the reporter is incompetent or is deliberately trying to deceive you can make your own guess
1986220 the equivalent of the north prudhoe bay permo triassic reservoir
1986221 we do not believe the evidence from these two wells indicates a massive new oil find
1986222 additional wells will have to be drilled and additional studies made before the economic feasibility of developing these known reservoirs is determined
1986223 there was an oil and gas trap there but there wasnt an economic quantity of oil
1986224 three directional wells have been drilled from gull island in prudhoe bay to different subsurface targets all of which tested different geologic prospects in and beyond the northern boundary of the earlier discovered prudhoe bay oil and gas accumulation
1986225 both the geologic evidence and the small area not yet developed into oil fields around the gull island wells preclude the possibility of a giant oil accumulation

1986232 opec is unlikely to change oil output in september to reverse the recent price fall unless the slide continues to below 80 a barrel an opec source said on tuesday
1986233 i dont think ministers will change output i think at less than 80 for opec oil maybe they would do something
1986234 the drop in prices was mostly due to a lull in july in the political tension between the west and iran over tehrans nuclear program the source said
1986235 that could easily be reversed and problems in opec member nigeria could also push prices higher the source added
1986236 militant attacks have cut about a fifth of nigerias output concerns that slowing economic growth in top consumer the united states could further curb demand had contributed to oils fall but the slide had little to do with market fundamentals the source said
1986237 the kingdom pushed its production to 9 7 million barrels per day up from 9 45 million bpd in june in response to rising demand and what it saw as unacceptably high prices

1986243 this case is another strong example of the serious ramifications that can come from letting impressionable teens play violent video games like this one
1986244 we urge parents to pay particular attention to their childrens extracurricular activities and to intervene before its too late
1986245 if you look at the whole population youth violent crime had gone down dramatically since the 1990s while playing computer games has gone up exponentially
1986246 none of the treatments studied had any significant benefit over no treatment at all
1986247 its not in the realm that you would expect it to be if these interventions were really performing

1986281 unison is taking the employer to the employment tribunal because it is saying that it has been kept in the dark over the transfer
1986282 the initial terms on which staff were transferred were not made available for consultation by the unions the case will be about whether staff were transferred without being fully informed of the terms

1986359 america has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world
1986360 is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas when we are taxing them out of the country unfortunately senator obamas plans would raise taxes on businesses even more he has promised tax increases on income tax increases on investment tax increases on small businesses this is exactly the wrong strategy raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs

1986381 i must also tell you that georgian forces have downed two russian jet fighters over georgias territory
1986382 under the constitution and the federal law i must protect the life and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are we will not allow their deaths to go unpunished those responsible will receive a deserved punishment
1986383 this night in south ossetia the georgian troops in fact committed an act of aggression against russian peacekeepers and the civilian population this is a rude violation of international law and mandates once issued to russia by the international community
1986384 dozens of identical events that occur in virtually the same sequence as well as numerous other similarities regarding characters plot and tone

1986403 i would say that the esa is still very viable and the association is really needed
1986404 because of that couple of weeks of discontent between the associations i think people are under the false impression that we want to see anything bad happen to the esa and that is not at all the case
1986405 you know i think a strong and vibrant esa is really important to the sector as a whole as far as their membership going forward they have some really big challenges ahead of them and its a difficult time so the show will probably be one of the things that the current membership is looking at in terms of value proposition
1986406 i was actually really surprised by the level of coverage even international coverage that it received
1986407 what i would attribute it to is that the vast majority of time our expectations and our goals and our challenges are going to be the exact same as those of the igda international game developers association the ema entertainment merchants assocation and the esa because they represent the industry and we represent the consumers
1986408 and 80 per cent of the time well get along great but that other 20 per cent of the time were going to be divergent in terms of our interests on behalf of our members and with respect to the comment that the esa issued i chalk it up to a month or two of frustration on behalf of the individual who made the statement
1986409 it was a difficult couple of months and they were under a lot of pressure getting a lot of bad press and it was easy to take a swipe it was unfortunate and i think he regrets it

1986416 have opposed forcing oil companies to drill on the 68 million acres they already control new investments in renewable energy increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards making mass transit more affordable cracking down on price gouging and releasing oil from the governments stockpile
1986417 the last thing you want to do is sit on potential oil production or natural gas production
1986418 if they arent being developed as fast as some in congress would like them to be the reason mainly has to do with geology or the reality that it takes a long time to develop these leases depending on where they are and there is no guarantee that they have oil and gas on them
1986419 and theyve done seismic surveys of those areas and they havent found much
1986420 when an energy company gets a lease there is no guarantee that there is oil or natural gas present under the leased lands if oil is present exploration siting and development can take up to a decade before any new energy is produced so the land democrats are talking about either has no recoverable energy resources those resources are currently being developed or they have already been developed the entire process can take years

1986439 this was because i was offending other customers and also she told me to mind that there were children around she said
1986440 i would love for them to explain to me like a two year old what is so offensive about me feeding my child
1986441 to set the record straight we do have a breastfeeding policy that allows women to feed their children in all our stores
1986442 it wasnt handled in the best possible way that is clear

1986457 if 51 of the workers are forced to sign the cards there is no vote
1986458 but even if that point were not true that doesnt mean that the statement that al franken didnt pay workers comp is false too
1986459 i didnt say there were no procedures for a secret ballot
1986460 it simply eliminates strips removes and does away with the use of any secret ballot in a real and practical sense
1986461 oh well technically it doesnt strip workers of a secret ballot but in a practical sense its gone
1986462 the board shall not direct an election but shall certify
1986463 if walmart bosses intimidate workers into signing no on their public cards would you say that the workers have been denied their right to a secret ballot
1986464 substantial number of employees wish to be represented for collective bargaining and that their employer declines to recognize their representative
1986465 in fact the actual words of the efca say the board shall not direct an election but shall certify it eliminates the secret ballot you dummy
1986466 if i get a pile of cards that say you and your stinking socialist ilk forfeit your right to vote in november you gonna stay home
1986467 there is no secret ballot if a majority of workers have already indicated they want a union
1986468 the secret ballot isnt eliminated by adding a provision that allows a second path to unionization
1986469 do me a favor pd and explain to us why a poll tax is illegal after all it technically doesnt strip anybody of their right to vote they just have to pay the tax first no problem right
1986470 it has been explained over and over in the simplest terms so many times here im sure my dog gets it by now
1986471 you represent the very best of our great country and your dedication skill and courage are an inspiration to millions of us

1986473 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
1986474 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
1986475 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
1986476 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
1986477 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
1986478 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
1986479 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
1986480 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind
1986481 its hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior when i am being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home so i dont spread the pestilence

1986485 bruce has been an absolute manic basket case the last few days
1986486 im more concerned about turning over the ball the way we have the last three games than with how our defence has played
1986487 we turned the ball over five times in the last two games so we should feel lucky to be 1 1 in those games turnovers are the real issue in football
1986488 my feeling is theres little difference between the team thats 6 0 right now saskatchewan and the team thats 1 5
1986489 its about 12 plays that separates all the teams from being just like us 3 3
1986490 were going into a tough situation on friday night against a championship calibre team
1986491 we could have closed out those games so we put that on ourselves
1986492 no matter how many points we put up we need to improve
1986493 we could have sustained more drives killed more clock and that would have really improved our chances of winning we did a good job against hamilton last week with three minutes to go and we have to do the same
1986494 with all due respect to ryan he is not the best quarterback on the winnipeg blue bombers

1986502 were going to get it out over the small wood utilization network as fast as we can
1986503 there are a lot of different ways to skin a cat

1986505 we would love to see somebody pick this property up before the auction and continue to run a sawmill in the county its important in the long haul for forest health reasons
1986506 desperate to avoid the merits of clemenss claims mcnamee moves to dismiss on insubstantial and frivolous grounds that are contrary to controlling authority which requires mcnamee to answer to a texas court and jury for his intentional conduct that injured a texas resident in texas
1986507 because most of the key witnesses in this case are in the southern district of texas the cost of attendance in new york city for willing witnesses is substantially higher than it would be in houston and the courts in the southern district of texas are less congested
1986508 whether mcnamee falsely charged clemens with using steroids in new york texas or on the moon is of little consequence it simply does not change that mcnamees conduct was calculated to and did harm clemens where he lived and worked
1986509 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
1986510 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
1986511 we knew from our past research on black widows that cobweb spiders adjust their web architectures in response to different availabilities of prey
1986512 but we didnt know much about how spiders might alter the silk used to spin cobwebs
1986513 silk spun by spiders fed crickets could support twice as much weight as silk spun by spiders fed pill bugs
1986514 a single thread from their web could support a cricket twice as heavy as the spider itself without breaking
1986515 the complexity of what these spiders are able to do is pretty striking
1986516 spider silk is being revealed to be not just one substance but an array of compounds that can do different things
1986517 we need to tease apart whether these silks are being woven in different ways by the spiders or if they are in fact chemically different from one another
1986518 this is a major phenomenon that could endanger the cinema and audiovisual industry
1986519 actually ive created a superhero with stan lee which is based on me and were doing a cartoon right now with mtv

1986521 we showered at the gym and lived in one room with construction going on all around it
1986522 we thought wed paint and finish the floors and wed be done
1986523 if there is a good opportunity we might do it renovate again
1986524 open up a pandoras box allowing people to play god
1986525 many such prenatal diagnoses have been proved wrong at birth time
1986526 diagnosis of fetal abnormality is not easy and is not always accurate
1986527 more conscientious and responsible towards bringing life into this world
1986528 killing of any living being is evil and even more so when it is aimed at a powerless fetus
1986529 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
1986530 folklore tells us it is the childless couples or the women who want more children in the house who seek adoption
1986531 this tells us there is another face of adoption it is more complex than we had thought
1986532 weve seen an increase in same sex couples adopting and this is a trend all over the country
1986533 if you think about same sex couples gay men who want children really have to adopt but gay women can have their own children i dont see as many gay female couples adopting as gay male couples
1986534 thierry meyssan linternet est d j un champ de bataille au sens militaire du terme
1986535 audio devices in particular should be left on all the time
1986536 its a huge no no with anything with a file system
1986537 copy to chief administrator moon chief engineer farside supervisor traffic control tourist commissioner central filing classify as confidential
1986538 i had no decision making responsibility no authority ive never even been to the job site and my company had nothing to do with it either
1986539 suffolk construction did not supervise the construction of the commerce park housing project or manage its construction costs
1986540 but two years ago or so we went our separate ways
1986541 my company suffolk construction company and my fathers organization eaf are completely separate entities
1986542 for too long many governments businesses and individuals have been wary of committing to action on climate change because they perceive that china the worlds largest emitter is doing little to address the issue however the reality is that chinas government is beginning to unleash a low carbon dragon which will power its future growth development and energy security objectives
1986543 far from ignoring climate change chinese leaders have already committed to improving energy efficiency and scaling up the growth of low carbon industries china is beginning to pull its weight on climate change and the targets and policies in place are in line with those being taken by leading countries like the uk and germany
1986544 chinas current trajectory will ensure it remains a strategic global hub for low carbon investment innovation and growth over coming decades
1986545 there is no chance you can be rehabilitated though we have tried and tried
1986546 im still afraid to be in my own house i wake up at night at the slightest sound with my heart racing i dont trust people anymore

1986571 siv jensen dessverre fordi hun er en drivende dyktig politiker men dessverre for feil parti
1986572 i have no illusions that it will be difficult as it was last time to actually agree the text of some tough sanctions in the security council
1986573 we are at a fairly early stage in this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to some targeted sanctions whether they be in the energy sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance and other financial areas which we would look at if we were looking to increase pressure on the iranian leadership

1986575 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side
1986576 i wish we did what we did in the fourth quarter in the third and second quarter and first quarter
1986577 it was a tough one it felt like we were flat we have to find a way to pick it up quicker than we did
1986578 even though we had the momentum they found a way to get a big play there and turn it around
1986579 it was good that we were able to stay poised and composed and go out there when we had the ball on an opportunity to close it out and we did just that
1986580 i know me personally i have a lot of confidence in the guys that play so im not using that as an excuse at all
1986581 as a running back you want the load on your shoulders

1986592 when a president leaves the shore i think as a country we should be united behind him i had another opinion but he differed
1986593 we dont want to do what jimmy carter did which is sit out the games and ruin what athletes worked four to eight years to accomplish it had no effect other than to prompt them to keep their athletes out four years later the olympics should not be a political football
1986594 i dont really have a comment on what the president should do
1986595 most members of congress find it abhorrent what chinas human rights record has been with regards to tibet this might be the most controversial olympics since 1972
1986596 please infidel sirs let him come home his goat is very lonely

1986601 i take it as an overwhelming peoples desire that parliament should function properly which is the most important body in the country representing the people as a whole
1986602 i consciously decided not to take part in any affairs of the party sitting on the chair i never espoused any cause
1986603 modestly i proclaim that i have conspicuously never done anything to support a b or c

1986608 the internet is the most powerful tool in the world its everywhere
1986609 first and foremost when i think about the olympics i think about when i was a kid and watching the 92 dream team win it all winning the gold medal
1986610 its the prestige of the gold medal the prestige of the olympics that is so big to me
1986611 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
1986612 capmex will be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
1986613 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
1986614 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in the polluted regions of the atmosphere
1986615 capmex takes this work an important step forward with new micro and nano sensor technologies these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
1986616 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming

1986654 there may well be some sort of kill switch that apple can deploy to remotely disable an app thats already installed but this list is not it
1986655 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down
1986656 is this something to be outraged about yes its creepy that iphone can phone home and deactivate your apps but the risk reward is clearly in apples favor

1986667 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior

1986669 communities are terrorized by ice immigration and customs enforcement immigration raids
1986670 on behalf of the 26 000 members of the federal law enforcement officers association fleoa i take great exception to your disparaging remark communities are terrorized by ice immigration raids
1986671 while the dedicated men and women of ice endeavor to carry out their dangerous and noble missions you somehow felt compelled to characterize their efforts as something akin to terrorizing
1986672 its one thing to remark intelligently on the need for immigration reform but its quite another to berate ice law enforcement officers who are risking their lives to enforce the laws passed by congress
1986673 your bi partisan fumble should not translate into labeling our members as terrorists by implication

1986679 the agency came up with their own a symbol of hope and progress that also plays off obamas name
1986680 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
1986681 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity

1986698 they all show maximum claims based on the data available today
1986699 my guess is that the canadian government has produced a similar map but they cannot publish it as this is politically sensitive stuff
1986700 what weve done is stick our neck above the parapet by plotting the distances ourselves and releasing it publicly

1986707 two trends weve seen are were investing in deals were already in and keeping them alive longer because conditions are not ripe for an exit
1986708 were also giving more to portfolio companies when times are tight we want to overfund
1986709 since their net worth may be down angels have less to invest so were seeing that instead of one angel putting 100 000 into a deal four or five angels might put in 25 000 to 20 000 apiece

1986727 a psychological report hasnt even been done yet on li
1986728 it was very strange he was looking at it the way youd expect a three year old would do
1986729 i went up to him and said vince its just a newspaper vending machine
1986730 he was a good guy i respected him he respected me
1986731 they wont let us in but we have a group that will cross in another spot
1986732 theyll have to strip search everyone who crosses that border or they wont know who we are theyll have to see the wbc westboro baptist church tattoo on our butts
1986733 these people from westboro are almost as crazy as the murderer
1986734 if they are here to disrupt the social order that constitutes grounds to deny them entry there is no redeeming virtue in the message they are bringing
1986735 in the opinion of his office coming up here with the message theyre articulating constitutes hate speech
1986736 theres been a fish kill at the lake mostly little shad but some bluegills also
1986737 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
1986738 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
1986739 nice to see that the wealthy left is segregating people according to their wealth
1986740 do you know how much money he married into while spending his entire life on the government dole
1986741 living of the government dole is welfare moms with 6 babies from 9 different fathers
1986742 he also at least waited a few years after the divorce to julia before moving on the teresa
1986743 what about those who utilize government services and pay no taxes or very damn little do you distinguish a difference both make the burden heavier for the middle class
1986744 he was also given and a congressional seat senate seat and national credibility
1986745 he doesnt get the presidency he doesnt get to pretend like his character is not of issue here it is he doesnt get to escape questions on his judgment temperament and values because yes the presidency is more than an award for past deeds its about the future of this country
1986746 i was there and franken and was not booted from anywhere
1986747 even if he did was asked to leave it would have been a short conversation and thats it
1986748 working for the government is honorable no democrat slams that
1986749 living of the government dole is welfare moms with 6 babies from 9 different fathers
1986750 an hero to take that shot to leave us all behind god do we wish we could take it back
1986751 a large scale analysis of data suggests that theres very little difference between men and womens abilities in math
1986752 a combination of women for dummies everything you wanted to know about women but was afraid to ask sic and women the missing manual
1986753 who wants to stay married or market stuff to women should read this
1986754 men simply dont have to be able to process social interactions at the same level or type of complexity that women do just to stay alive
1986755 im so sick of this math thing math who sits around doing math men come on men sit around looking at porn
1986756 no dude seriously weve got scientific proof that women are a diverse group of people theyre not all the same so your how women work articles are fundamentally flawed right from the beginning
1986757 sure women may have a few differences between them but the most important thing is how freakin weird they are amirite its like theyre a completely different
1986758 women are what happens when god removes a rib from a man and fashions a strange creature that might be human but lacks a penis and testicles mathematical ability emotional stability physical prowess and in return gets titties and the benefit of enslaving the better sex with their awfully tempting vaginas
1986759 why do you think its okay to treat another human being like that
1986760 do you want me to change your diapers as well

1986766 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
1986767 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
1986768 oh absolutely yeah absolutely and the reason we say that is the type of capabilities they have
1986769 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space

1986772 ive just decided to step back from the day to day running of american idol basically
1986773 you know what the schedule was like it was 24 7 and then some
1986774 i just needed a break to go and do something else basically
1986775 its such a wonderful team now everybody thank goodness knows what theyre doing

1986783 lack of bearings a rootlessness a loss of identity a sense of social frustration and failure a disintegrated family
1986784 anti zionism legitimises the palestinian armed struggle even when it targets innocent civilians
1986785 thus it could also legitimise violent acts committed in france
1986786 she priscilla lord faris has until sept 9 the date of the primary to convince democrats that her local roots would be a better match against coleman than frankens name recognition
1986787 are we having minnesota cards mailed to other states are people traveling there are they selling them are they bartering them whats going on
1986788 and 10 million is not a small amount of money in terms of the state budget so i think its worth looking into and having hearings and finding a way to bring more accountability to these cards
1986789 someone in stillwater who shops in hudson thats a perfectly reasonable situation
1986790 but someone who several months in a row is doing all transactions in pennsylvania would be a situation that might warrant investigation
1986791 we are absolutely committed to taking all the necessary measures to protect the mountain gorillas and bring security to the people living around virunga national park
1986792 the new team that we have appointed is a major step toward achieving this goal

1986794 i try and read the blog everyday and have pointed it out to other faculty who have their students read it for class it is truly one of the best things in the blogosphere
1986795 i bet economists are better at modeling than climate scientists
1986796 the guy seems to need to be reminded that economics has been studied and examined much more and for much longer than climate change hence it makes more sense to me that climate change needs to adapt to economics not the other way around
1986797 ok sure he killed those 8 women in toledo but he was in kansas when the 9th body was found
1986798 if linux hasnt been adopted within any specific vertical industry over the next decade its likely that linux will never experience much use within that specific industry
1986799 i wanted to capture the beauty of st ives and show my respect for it
1986800 ive got the most beautiful film on the planet thats what lifes about something will crop up and it will be ok
1986801 it was terrifying having this drink problem and id like to make a film showing people especially young people what i went through but id show footprints immediately afterwards to demonstrate what you can achieve if you beat it
1986802 my intent in writing this book as was the case in coauthoring unfit for command is to fully document all arguments and contentions i make extensively footnoting all references so readers can determine for themselves the truth and validity of the factual claims
1986803 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it the lie can be maintained only for such time as the state can shield the people from the political economic and or military consequences of the lie it thus becomes vitally important for the state to use all of its powers to repress dissent for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie and thus by extension the truth is the greatest enemy of the state
1986804 we basically filed a brief that says if you injure someone in houston texas you should properly be held accountable in houston
1986805 mcnamee slandered roger in houston and thats where the injury occurred
1986806 theyre trying to get a federal judge in houston to say that proper jurisdiction for suing mcnamee is in new york
1986807 its sort of the legal equivalent of dont mess with texas
1986808 hes spending most of his time following kobys career and following his kids
1986809 paul didnt want to die in the hospital joanne and their daughters are beside themselves with grief
1986810 he gave a prized car a ferrari with his racing number 82 on it to a long time pal the sudden move angered his children its especially hard for them to come to grips with whats going on
1986811 the word theyve been given is that he has only a few weeks to live
1986812 attorney general mukasey gave a wonderful opening prayer that really struck the president and bush noted that a number of cabinet members over the years have opened these meetings with strong words of faith
1986813 i can say this now but i thought it was hilarious that we hadnt thrown a touchdown pass in a passing league
1986814 we played like we were fighting for something thats the way we have to play
1986815 im going to enjoy this tonight then watch the film friday
1986816 it isnt always pretty but he has a knack of making plays

1986821 they did a lot of different things on second down and made some good adjustments
1986822 star wars is a policy that sounds good in a speech
1986823 but what sounds good on paper would be a disaster in practice
1986824 it is not correct to assume counter measures would work in every instance
1986825 we should not be dissuaded from putting a missile defense in place based on the assumption that we cant defeat counter measures thats giving these critics a great amount of leeway
1986826 undoubtedly there will be counter measures and there will be this cat and mouse
1986827 but for the ucs and others to say this system does not have the ability to overcome countermeasure is on its face flawed because they are not privy to any developments related to missile defense that have been classified since the year 2000
1986828 this achievement affirms the current technologys ability to track and discriminate between countermeasures and decoys of future ballistic missile configurations
1986829 this test marks an important achievement as it enables the capability needed as a hedge against the next generation of ballistic missiles

1986853 the scottish government has signalled strong intentions to reduce smoking uptake amongst young people and improve the health of scotlands people in the future with the publication of the smoking prevention action plan it must also address the health divide between our communities if scotland is to banish its reputation as the sick man of europe
1986854 the crucial thing is for smoking cessation services to be focused on areas of multiple deprivation there are huge numbers of smokers in these areas and you have to have effective outreach services to get to the people who are not going to clinics
1986855 the attacker can forcibly install google gadgets they can read the victims search history once a malicious gadget has been installed in some specific circumstances they can attack other google gadgets they can
1986856 really the sky is the limit once the browser is under the control of an attacker and that point is exacerbated by the fact that people trust google be a trustworthy domain making the attacks even easier

1986868 who could throw all of these resources behind a single investigation
1986869 for investigative blockbusters like the trolls among us you have to go to dinosaur media such as the new york times the atlantic monthly or the new yorker
1986870 despite excluding hall from all aspects of the partnership business nettles and bush have not compensated hall for her interest in the partnership property brand or good will or her individual property interest in the sugarland trade name trademark and service mark
1986871 if abdo and his group filed that means hall is not getting a fair shake
1986872 whoever the partner he is negotiating with is he has probably stonewalled him
1986873 knowing the reputation of ken abdo and his partners hes not going to file a frivolous lawsuit
1986874 but that doesnt mean he wont file a lawsuit asking for a lot more than he expects to win

1986933 this case ended in disaster if a report has been published then it should all be above board and put in the public domain
1986934 the public need to know what they are going to do to put it right its vitally important we all have total confidence in the prosecution system
1986935 we confirm that the internal review of the case has now been completed and arrangements are in the process of being agreed for the solicitor general to meet the families of the victims in order that the content might be discussed with them
1986936 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
1986937 for instance in the june issue of vogue magazine cindy mccain said she favors suits made by the german designer escada which typically retail for around 3 000 a pop if she becomes first lady she told vogue she may switch to an american designer possibly carolina herrera whose suits are comparably pricey
1986938 while cindy mccain her dependent children and the trusts and companies they control made as much as 29 million blah blah blah

1986942 note to dhs searching a laptop is not the same as searching a backpack
1986943 2 its like searching your home our laptops contain family photos medical records finances personal diaries and all the other detailed records of our most personal lives having the government rummage through all these files is like searching your home and that requires a probable cause warrant
1986944 i am such an idiot for violating americans privacy rights for something that protects the u s in no discernible way
1986945 its no wonder theres such division between you and the conservatives as soon as you hear something that you might not like you espouse hatred and name calling how very progressive of you do you actually kiss your mother with that mouth
1986946 she must have allowed her laptop to be misappropriated hacked etc
1986947 under fisa of course the fbi field agents could have searched moussaouis personal effects and then fbi headquarters ashcroft could have gone to the fisa court within forty eight hours afterward explained the reason for their warrantless search and requested a retroactive search warrant
1986948 so now the culture of corruption republicans after blowing off a perfectly legal pre fisa warrant search of a foreign nationals personal effects while in fbi custody are conducting warrantless searches of laptops at border crossings but without that pesky fisa probable cause or the fourth amendment getting in their way which leads me to suspect that ahern isnt really stating what the warrantless border searches are really meant to find

1986952 clearly plaintiff could have access to the contents of a file cabinet left in the marital residence in the same fashion she should have access to the contents of the computer
1986953 sections of the penal law cited by the defendant do not govern the circumstances presented
1986954 in accessing the disputed files the plaintiff did not intercept overhear or access electronic communications
1986955 defendant states that only he was authorized to log on and that his password was a strong one
1986956 plaintiffs expert attests that no files on the computer were encrypted and no passwords were required
1986957 we are delighted that u s trust chose to use this first time innovative new york times magazine advertising unit to promote its philanthropic management capabilities

1986960 if you dont learn to read music then theres a whole tradition that becomes very exclusive and shouldnt be
1986961 the idea of it being completely absent from the most important exams of your childhood is disgraceful
1986962 i used to write for small orchestras when i was 15 i sold my soul to the devil and became a pop star and forgot about it but in the past few years i have got back into orchestration after an almost 20 year hiatus

1986968 i dont believe we can get to the right outcome in afghanistan as long as these militant sanctuaries exist across the border
1986969 weve seen the increased numbers of foreign fighters in eastern and southern afghanistan this year and there is an expectation that the leadership in pakistan will do something about these militant sanctuaries in their country
1986970 so its been a week since rc1 and rc2 is out there
1986971 theres a lot of random changes in there and im hoping were starting to calm down but one particular kind of random change is probably worth pointing out explicitly due to the things it can result in the fact that a number of architectures ended up using the lull after rc1 hah to do the include asm xyz gt arch xyz include asm renames
1986972 the dirstat with rename detection on so as to not show the movement as huge changes is fairly usual with most of the changes in drivers along with an ext4 and xfs update making fs show up pretty high too

1986979 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended
1986980 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1986981 en tourpoule met in totaal meer dan 250 000 deelnemers is nu ook een peking poule opgericht
1986982 if i use the analogy of mtv twenty five years ago or even apple five years ago those are two ecosystems in which companies outside of recorded music have derived the majority of the value created in that ecosystem
1986983 that i think is the state we are currently in with activision and harmonix where the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
1986984 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
1986985 it was a stylistic choice knowing that the time we were going to have and the speed we were going to move at i instantly knew that photorealism wasnt an area that we were going to go to
1986986 i talked to the crew and i talked to george about well lets just forget photorealism and lets go in this direction and force the style
1986987 and that happened to be what george really wanted to do we talked about sculpting with light and shadow and thats where you get the angles on the characters faces and i was aware and really afraid of the kind of lifeless cg that you can wind up with

1986991 but we just couldnt deal with that many people affected by alcohol
1986992 it is embarrassing weve sworn an oath to do certain things and were not being given the resources to achieve that
1986993 its deemed more acceptable than in the city because the valleys the alternative scene and always has been
1986994 when certain people drink it brings out more of a violent tendency often leading to problems
1986995 young men especially can become aggressive on alcohol and get involved in fights and assaults
1986996 the really common things that we see at the royal brisbane and womens hospital are head injuries where theyve fallen over and hit their heads and we see lots of people with broken hands after hitting people
1986997 it really is very frustrating from a medical perspective because it chews up our resources if people didnt drink we wouldnt see anywhere near as many patients as we do
1986998 the big thing a lot of us feel is that one of the most dangerous and insidious things about e ecstasy is that most young people think its not hurting them but every time they use it its hurting them a little
1986999 we deal with them all the time these kids who are now 30 or 40 who are suffering serious mental health problems as a result of their drug use in their 20s often it ends in suicide

1987014 we are not suing ma to seek payback for chen we are suing ma to uphold the nations legal system as well as to defend national security
1987015 such as the names of national security agents and the nations dealings with foreign countries
1987016 we are not suing ma to seek payback for chen we are suing ma to uphold the nations legal system as well as to defend national security
1987017 if we were to open classified documents who in the future would risk their necks and serve as agents only to be sold out by his or her own country later
1987018 ma made a severe mistake by acting like the red clad protesters in hunting chen down
1987019 ma is conducting a witch hunt to please deep blue voters doesnt he have more important things to focus on such as boosting the economy
1987020 shifting the focus will not change the fact that those documents are not national secrets

1987027 supplies of food shelter materials water and sanitations equipment and fuel for the transportation of civilians are running dangerously low
1987028 efforts by humanitarian agencies to replenish the stocks are hindered by the strict restrictions on the transport of goods into the region
1987029 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur
1987030 this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
1987031 the use of some cbrn materials has the potential to have very serious and widespread consequences
1987032 an example would be the use if a nuclear device
1987033 there is no historical precedent for this type of terrorist attack
1987034 this should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
1987035 the government is collaborating actively with international partners on prevention detection and research and is taking every practical step to ensure that the uk is prepared to limit the internal spread of a pandemic and to minimise health economic and social harm as far as possible
1987036 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things
1987037 a thing like the flu pandemic its very difficult to gauge exactly what the scale of it will be
1987038 we have done a great deal of work on it and i hope when people read this they will be reassured by the amount of work that we have done within government
1987039 we have been urging the government to be more open about the risks the uk faces for some time
1987040 however the real value of it will depend on how good the information supporting it is and if the government actually deals with the threats it highlights
1987041 for example while the resilience of supply chains is crucial we compare extremely poorly with comparable advanced economies when it comes to stockpiling oil and gas resources to sustain us through an emergency

1987069 summary use of social boycott in order to bend a minority to the will of the majority is a species of unpardonable violence we may not make people pure by compulsion much less may we compel them by violence to respect our opinion keep in mind here that gandhi was not simply speaking to physical violence but more importantly violence of the heart and mind it is utterly against the spirit of democracy we want to cultivate i t would be wisdom to err on the right side and to exercise the weapon even in the limited sense on rare and well defined occasions

1987071 allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1987072 no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from c i a ever involved in any such effort
1987073 never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbash as outlined in mr suskinds book
1987074 contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way

1987087 mukherjee beautifully weaves the ever morphing web of technology business and organizational learning together and explains why both top executives and middle managers must care about their impact
1987088 the business world is moving toward non hierarchical networks the answer to these changes is a combination of network management and collaborative leadership mukherjee goes beyond description of best practices the four design principles that he has developed to implement networks are conceptually well thought through and actionable this book deserves to be read by anybody who is interested in tomorrows organization
1987089 an adaptive organization must count as the response in the increasingly connected world in which business will operate in the decades ahead
1987090 beyond the obvious this is a great and pragmatic book demonstrating the incredible power of collaboration in action
1987091 though many have sought to unlock the secrets of creating learning organizations few have succeeded in the spiders strategy mukherjee provides the keys to the learning kingdom and he shows what it really takes to leverage the power of networks it is that rare business book that deserves to be read from cover to cover
1987092 mukherjee has written a very thoughtful and thought provoking book the adaptive network perspective with its four design principles and the accompanying five capabilities inspired by a chief network officer will be the organizations of the present and future the book presents good theory research grounded in facts and a clear picture of what is both necessary and possible going forward
1987093 it looks at the whole range of risks and looks at them from a national perspective

1987099 wom is not a new phenomenon in china people see it as an innovative tool because of the power of connectivity that digital media penetration has recently brought developments in technology mean that wom marketing is quicker more interactive and far more wide reaching than ever before
1987100 wom has existed forever in china in a market where the command and control advertising television and mass circulation newspaper model of the united states has never really existed before driving buzz has long been the best way to build the relationship between brand and consumers
1987101 chinese consumers are now more than ready to embrace wom its their medium this is a global trend to some extent but much more so here in china where trust levels for traditional media are incredibly low and guanxi personal relationships can affect everything from your career to finding that unique pair of retro sneakers
1987102 the key to wom success in china is the story you create whether it be your product itself or an asset you create it all begins with having something remarkable enough to be worth talking about blogging is a great tool for this over time but nothing beats real world interactions they should always start small small enough so you can interact effectively with your audience they should be a remarkable experience that starts with the invitation runs through the event itself and out the back with a take home memento
1987103 we find in a lot of cases that the digital medium merely conveys what has happened offline beforehand the success of an event or promotion spreads across the internet like ripples on water blogs and bbs are just tools for conveying messages from the real world it is our job to make sure those messages are the right ones
1987104 in both wom and iwom marketing today innovation is the key because the digital world is changing daily video sharing blogging and communication with communities may work well this year but next year therell be different techniques traditional wom is old news in china but iwom is a baby china will contribute a lot to the development of iwom because of its numerous internet users rapid economic growth and increasingly open and innovative culture

1987135 you try to lay back and be nice to employees
1987136 we just followed the law i dont know how an employer could allow a person who smokes to take breaks and not give that same benefit to another employee even if the law allowed that you know there would be hard feelings
1987137 its a manufactured friction because these laws are empowering those who would not otherwise complain
1987138 what most employers do is judge their employees work performance before they judge their conduct if there was a smoking room inside you wouldnt have these problems to begin with

1987143 normally when they introduce a new category it takes some upfront development costs
1987144 i believe when they introduced the early ipods they said something similar about impacting the margins it appears they have something really new in the works

1987157 credeam ca am scapat de ea s a retras dupa atena si a facut un copil anul trecut insa a revenit pe tatami cu ocazia mondialelor cucerind aurul
1987158 in cazul in care voi urca pe podiumul olimpic imi doresc sa fac o pauza pentru a deveni mama un eventual esec pe care nu vreau sa l iau in calcul s ar putea sa ma determine sa renunt definitv la sport

1987160 i was on a united airlines flight 664 you dont remember the numbers of many flights in your life but this was a night that my life changed
1987161 for me being an f 16 pilot ive seen combat ive seen death and destruction in iraq but id never seen that side of it and having three daughters of my own it was something that really struck me
1987162 i cannot imagine that theres anything else that could be any more worthwhile
1987163 in the fact that i think my son couldnt be more happy than to have his death inspire the foundation
1987164 this small seed that started right here in west michigan in grand haven of all places that has gone across this country
1987165 hes our son thats the extension of our son so if we cant have our son jacob is what we have
1987166 i think brock would be really happy and very happy and i think hed be very proud of who jacob is and what hes becoming

1987175 anyway a year ago i signed a contract to do a one volume book for tokyopop about quinceaneras they approached me directly with the idea they wanted me to make a script for it and illustrate it so again it was a purely work for hire situation however after completing the scipt and thumbnails there was a change of plans they told me they wanted to split the one volume into two to give the story more space to be told

1987181 i think well see in years ahead that this opens the door to a new way to treating degenerative diseases
1987182 represent a collection of degenerative diseases for which there are no good treatments and more importantly no good animal models for the most part in studying them
1987183 the hope is that this will accelerate research and it will create a climate of openness
1987184 at least for the foreseeable future and i would argue forever they are going to be extremely valuable tools

1987186 instead of complaining about the state of the education system as we correct the same mistakes year after year ive got a better idea
1987187 university teachers should simply accept as variant spelling those words our students most commonly misspell
1987188 there are enormous advantages in having a coherent system of spelling
1987189 it makes it easier to communicate maybe during a learning phase there is some scope for error but i would hope that by the time people get to university they have learnt to spell
1987190 it looks likely that hell get a jail term plus a bad discharge
1987191 over a year and then the discharge if he gets a bad discharge a dishonorable discharge thats the equivalent of a felony conviction
1987192 this is good news of course but it continues to be unacceptable that the chinese government can decide according to its mood which websites are censored and which are accessible
1987193 gapingvoid does that still apply if i think the other is better than me
1987194 sag mir doch mal warum du mir wenn ich dich bitte mir ein kleines bisschen die haare zu stutzen die haare gleich abm hst als w rst du ein beschissener australischer schafscherer
1987195 fang doch bitte nicht wieder damit an ich bin doch nicht dein verkackter lehrer dem du erz hlen kannst du h ttest die hausaufgaben gemacht ganz ehrlich nur leider sind sie dir aus dem schulranzen geklaut worden hier
1987196 ich bin doch nicht blind und wenn ich blind w re k nnte ich doch immer noch f hlen die waren vorher so lang
1987197 und jetzt sind das nur noch wehrmachtsstummel ich sehe aus wie lord helmchen der sich als kapaun verkleidet hat
1987198 wenn du jemandem die haare schneidest und das nicht kannst dann machst du das doch doppelt vorsichtig dann schneidest du ein winziges st ckchen und dann nimmst du einen deiner zahlreichen handspiegel und fragst ob es so in ordnung ist aber du machst doch nicht schnappschnapp und bist nach f nf minuten fertig als du nach f nf minuten fertig gesagt hast wusste ich schon dass das ins auge gegangen ist aber so ist es ja immer wenn es um mich geht dann muss alles ganz schnell gehen weil ich dir nichts bedeute weil du mich nicht liebst
1987199 aber h tte sie nicht im knast gesessen und drogen genommen w re ich doch nur eine pastorentochter

1987206 now more than ever it no longer make sense to perpetuate a system that requires or permits terminating carriers to apply different rates for different traffic based on arbitrary distinctions
1987207 comprehensive reform of the existing intercarrier compensation system is critical to accommodate progress and innovation and to ensure technological and competitive neutrality

1987212 we looked at them and we were like wait a minute thats not the network we are sniffing
1987213 he seemed really arrogant laughing and happy about it it rubbed a lot of people the wrong way
1987214 its completely against what all of us are trying to do
1987215 one of the aims of the ioc international olympic committee is to stage the low carbon olympic games in the broadest sense from helping people plan their journey to the games through to how the games are broadcast around the world
1987216 this will marginally reduce the number of media on site
1987217 and thats why you dont need a publisher or syndicate
1987218 each one can be diffused or made impotent by kindness and politeness
1987219 seeking to counter prc peoples republic of china efforts to isolate taiwan by conditioning us assistance and economic interaction with other countries on taiwans greater international participation
1987220 what will it mean for the united states should taiwan lose its remaining diplomatic relationships around the world should the united states seek to play a more active role in seeking to improve taiwans international position perhaps by reassessing current us policy toward taiwan in light of chinas rise
1987221 chinas foreign policy what does it mean for us global interests
1987222 allows taiwans president and senior leaders to ask for controversial but symbolically meaningful transit stops in the united states when making official visits to these western hemisphere countries
1987223 a significant reduction or even the disappearance of taiwans latin america and caribbean relationships could impair this convenient taiwan us connection
1987224 incorporates the political dynamic of trying to separate taiwan from its remaining diplomatic relationships china claims that taiwan is part of its sovereign territory and for decades has tried to make acknowledgment of this one china policy a condition for receiving chinese investment and assistance
1987225 as us allies and hosts of us military facilities they potentially could become a factor in any us china conflict over taiwan
1987226 it is in chinas interests then to use its diplomatic and economic activities to exert quiet pressure on these us allies to stay out of any possible conflict over taiwan
1987227 our goal is to establish a mutually rewarding supply agreement with chrysler moving forward

1987230 but what you gain in mpgs you lose in rpms
1987231 more interesting is the little green hatchback in the background of the 3rd pic very interesting anyone know what it is
1987232 yes if youre asking me if some players quit absolutely they normally dont hang around the game much longer but its true
1987233 i guarantee you some fans care more than some players there are a bunch of guys who just look forward to their paycheck especially when the seasons hopeless and know they wont play for their team much longer passionate fans are more invested
1987234 the seventh inning was an example of a team that has completely given up
1987235 oh i bet youre going to call that a strike too huh
1987236 they do not mean anything dont tell the whole story etc
1987237 im happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes in fact im happy that the podium covers me from the waist down
1987238 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest like my colleague jujus abc news colleague juju chang
1987239 i think what has happened in recent years is judges are increasingly willing to defer to the decisions of law enforcement officials and their view of the balance of security and first amendment rights
1987240 and courts of appeals are going to defer to the district court judges ruling
1987241 what is regrettable from an aclu perspective is that there is a trend to strike the balance giving more weight to speculative and remote security concerns at the expense of first amendment rights of peaceful members of the public
1987242 we are going to file our appeal in the street
1987243 do not blame us for the confrontational situation that may come this will become ground zero for the fight of our civil liberties

1987248 there is what i would call a very paltry licensing fee per song
1987249 i think the industry as a whole needs to take a very different look at this business and participate more fully and in a much more partnership way and if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
1987250 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children

1987255 i have asked our lawyers to carefully review this opinion as we consider whether to appeal the ruling i know i speak for everyone in indian country when i say that it is difficult to reconcile the courts ruling with beneficiaries experiences with the individual indian money iim trust i am disappointed to say the least we believe we presented a strong compelling case that individual indian trust beneficiaries are entitled to much more than the governments admitted mismanagement of our trust monies over the past 120 years
1987256 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious web sites from anywhere on facebook less than 002 of people on facebook have been affected all of whom we notified and suggested steps to remove the malware

1987258 no facebook employee will ever ask for it and no one else should know it if you are ever prompted to log in to facebook make sure its from a legitimate facebook web address if something looks or feels off go directly to www facebook com to log in
1987259 im very excited about being near the lead i want to see what the pressure is like and how i will respond to it
1987260 when you feel you are not progressing not moving on in your career you start thinking about doing something else
1987261 i hadnt thought about it until somebody told me in sunday school
1987262 i remember a traveling evangelist came through and had a revival
1987263 people gave him a lot of money and he left town so that meant that we didnt have much to eat for the next two or three months
1987264 to ease the pain i guess and remember happier times
1987265 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
1987266 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
1987267 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
1987268 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
1987269 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
1987270 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
1987271 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
1987272 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
1987273 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me

1987303 according to kit a law enforcement officer approached young albert laney a passenger in kits vehicle pointed his finger at albert and said
1987304 the laneys on the other hand are the little guys who want nothing more than to continue living where their ancestors settled in 1883 doing what their ancestors have done for more than a century they have invested their life building their ranch to pass on to their children the tragedy is that if the big guys succeed in taking the property and life work of several generations of laneys they can also take the property and life work of every other western rancher whose livestock graze on so called public land if the laneys can halt this confiscation and taking of private property or force the government to pay for what they are taking then perhaps the big guys will have to rethink whether they can afford the cost
1987305 i didnt want my dad to lose his ranch like they did to kit laney

1987335 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
1987336 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
1987337 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
1987338 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
1987339 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
1987340 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument

1987350 she planted that joke months ago and patiently waited for me to get the finished books and egomaniacally go straight to the acknowledgements
1987351 i know for sure that you have a sense of humor and you completely understand why i had to put adam and god first
1987352 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done

1987373 the business community however has documented that applying the rule in real time to company supply chains will delay cargo by 2 5 days depending on the complexity of the supply chain

1987393 changed the 2004 campaign from a referendum on a sitting president to a referendum on john kerry
1987394 first obama is a superior candidate in terms of his skills and strategic understanding of how to win and second the winds for change in 2008 compared to 2004 is like a tornado compared to a breeze
1987395 all the macro trends favor the party out of power in this case the democrats

1987461 because when we pull out of iraq i trust that the bad guys will stop what theyre doing because they now think were good people
1987462 because i believe that people who cant tell us if it will rain on friday can tell us that the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if i dont start driving a prius
1987463 because i believe three or four pointy headed elitist liberals need to rewrite the constitution every few days to suit some fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters
1987464 because i believe that when the terrorists dont have to hide from us over there when they come over here i dont want to have any guns in the house to fight them off with
1987465 because i love the fact that i can now marry
1987466 i believe oil companies profits of 4 on a gallon of gas are obscene but the government taxing the same gallon of gas at 15 isnt

1987480 we take security and privacy very seriously which is why the british biometric passport meets international standards as set out by international civil aviation organisation icao and we remain confident that it is one of the most secure passports available
1987481 it is of deep concern the technology underpinning a key part of the uks security can be compromised so easily
1987482 what is worse the same technology will underpin the governments identity card scheme which risks making us less safe
1987483 by putting your private information on a chip on a passport or id card designed to let it be skimmed off for official purposes the whole centralised approach to id makes it easier for your life to be perfectly stolen
1987484 the government cannot be trusted to look after your identity
1987485 measures it calls secure are only securing official convenience with an id card or chipped passport youll never know whos walking around pretending to be you
1987486 the e passports fiasco clearly illustrates why the national identity scheme must be scrapped now before millions more peoples personal security is put at risk
1987487 were not claiming that terrorists are able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way

1987489 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices

1987510 ttac nominations for the best cars of 2008 thread and see the amount of drooling over the jaguar xf that was designed engineered and built in the uk
1987511 to make a comparison it would be like gm ford and chrysler was sold off to china india and indonesia and the biggest us owned companies would be saleen and mosler
1987512 the last uk designed vauxhall was the viva of the 70s
1987513 also mg rover continued through the 80s and deep into the 90s without any industrial action due to the fact that magaret thatcher decimated the unions and yet mg rover continued their steady decline
1987514 wheres the point in pouring money into competing on some minor market compared with the us when theres not much to gain anyway

1987520 ones body continues to live even if you go month after month without eating
1987521 not to be able to see was for him truly unacceptable
1987522 to free himself not so much from pain as from the body which was the origin of his suffering
1987523 was a masterpiece as much as his cinematic works he went in absolute peace embracing the absolute as if he were a mystic he wanted to de materialize
1987524 he came to the table with me to keep me company but only ate a few spoonfuls

1987529 good because thats probably the biggest crime issue over there in detroit these days felonious judges sneaking off for illicit day trips to canada

1987565 its time to recognize that markets do need to be regulated and that regulators have failed to fulfill their obligations over the past 25 years
1987566 i think it ought to be part of regulators duties to prevent asset bubbles from growing too big for that they would have to acknowledge that markets tend to produce bubbles
1987567 weve had a series of small financial crises since 1980 each time when the real economy was threatened the fed stepped in lowered interest rates provided monetary fiscal stimulus so we got out of it

1987569 well report vulnerabilities we find in third party software and well work with them to identify resolve and mitigate those vulnerabilities
1987570 thats a hard question were always looking to provide the best experience for our customers so well examine all aspects including vulnerability identification other mitigations and as a final link detection and deployment
1987571 the necessary information and assistance to develop an update to address the vulnerability
1987572 some may question our motives but this is for the good of customers and the enterprise and it will help protect their environment of microsoft software and other software as well
1987573 it will raise the level of security and is good for the whole ecosystem

1987584 nicola perra at the university of cagliari in italy and colleagues have discovered that when they re arrange the terms in the pagerank equation the result is a
1987585 it is as central to quantum mechanics as classical mechanics
1987586 what the wave equation allows is a study of the dynamic behaviour of pageranking how the rankings change and under what conditions says kfc adding
1987587 one of the key tools for this is called perturbation theory
1987588 its no understatement to say that perturbation theory revolutionised our understanding of the universe when it was applied to quantum theory in the 1920s and 1930s

1987590 while this may seem like any standard security hole other researchers say that the work is a major breakthrough and there is very little that microsoft can do to fix the problems
1987591 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
1987592 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions thats completely game over
1987593 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
1987594 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
1987595 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
1987596 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
1987597 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force

1987609 this bad bill will teach impressionable schoolchildren the anti religious homosexual bisexual transsexual agenda of harvey milk
1987610 the democrats are so cocky they have no qualms about pushing sexual indoctrination upon children in an election year for the love of god parents and their children we implore governor schwarzenegger to veto ab 2567

1987633 we would encourage all drivers male and female to think about the consequences of driving after having a drink
1987634 even one drink can impair judgement and affect our ability to drive if you are planning on driving the safest option really is to have nothing at all to drink
1987635 people think it wont happen to them that they wont get caught they wont be involved in a crash we must challenge these presumptions in order to change drivers attitudes and behaviour
1987636 the thought of getting caught and the consequences need to seem a very real prospect for drivers who through selfishness or ignorance continue to put lives at risk by getting behind the wheel after drinking
1987637 for drivers who do want to abide by the law we must make it easy for them to do so by sending out a very clear message that even one drink is one too many

1987653 in the past journalists and media organizations where much more guarded with what they were working on for fear of being beat by competitors or people not wanting to see how the sausage is made but we are in a unique time where blogs allow you to find sources that you may not have had to check the validity of the story youre pursing
1987654 our philosophy is that it is better to get 70 percent of a story up fast and get the basic facts right than to wait another hour or a day to get the remaining 30 percent we can always update the post or do another one as new information comes in more often than not putting up partial information is what leads us to the truth a source contacts us with more details or adds them directly into comments
1987655 the department is not aware of karl rove playing any role in the decision to appoint mr griffin
1987656 not aware of anyone lobbying either inside or outside of the administration for mr griffins appointment
1987657 it will be as much about the cover up as about the firings
1987658 are going to tell a narrative and they have taken their investigation right into the white house
1987659 i knew that then white house political director sara taylor and taylors then deputy scott jennings had expressed interest in promoting mr griffin for appointment to be u s attorney and i assumed because they reported to karl rove that he was interested in that
1987660 in february when i participated in the drafting of that february 23 letter i did not remember then ever having talked directly to mr rove about it i dont remember now ever having talked to mr rove about it im not sure whether mr rove was supportive of mr griffins appointment
1987661 kyle didnt want to traffic in assumptions so he circulated the letter to the white house for confirmation whether what he believed to be true was accurate or not he drafted the letter according to his understanding of the facts and he circulated it beforehand to other people for clearance to assure that it accorded with their understanding of the facts
1987662 chris did not recall karls interest when he reviewed the letter
1987663 we have no record of that letter even leaving the white house counsels office
1987664 im concerned we imply that well pull down griffins nomination should pryor object
1987665 i think we should gum this to death ask the senators to give tim a chance meet with him give him some time in office to see how he performs etc they ultimately say no never and the longer they forestall the better then we can tell them well look for other candidates and otherwise run out the clock all of this should be done in good faith of course
1987666 the only thing really at work here is a repeal of the ags appointment authority there is some risk that well lose that authority but if we dont ever exercise it then whats the point of having it
1987667 im not 100 percent sure that tim was the guy on which to test drive this authority but know that getting him appointed was important to harriet karl etc
1987668 the principals never adopted it and it was never done

1987676 bad communication can mean bad project management often there are very simple banal things that go wrong in communication that really impede a companys ability to succeed
1987677 some people have interpersonal intelligence to a lesser or greater degree than others at some level this cant be changed and theres a limit to how good youre going to be at communicating in terms of relating to people you need to have the skills to do that and this can be limited by natural ability
1987678 there is a limit to how defined the differences are when it comes to men and women they are a lot less dramatic than people like to think
1987679 youve got to view it in the round is the person deliberately abrupt or is it because they just dont have time to ask you how your cat is just because you think a person is abrupt doesnt necessarily mean they have been the ability to perceive is a natural ability and were very bad at training people to view things from another persons perceptive
1987680 while it is good to mirror an individuals non verbal communication in positive situations the rule of thumb is dont match peoples emotions if they are getting very heated dont match anger with anger
1987681 enormous progress has been made by people across northern ireland to deal with outstanding issues from the troubles however there are still vestiges of this time for which we need greater clarification

1987700 i saw you on the o reilly factor a second ago and i have to say that i respect you for coming on the program and saying what you believe to mr oreilly
1987701 i happen to be a conservative and disagree with your statements but as bill said you re a stand up guy and i respect you for that
1987702 i just watched your conversation with br on the o reilly factor
1987703 and until that moment id never heard of you but i want to say how delightful and gracious you were very open and credible you are a very prepossessing gentlemen br made nothing off your forthrighness about having some reservation about what you had written regarding jon voight i thought that was high drama welcome to my world ill be watching and reading you

1987708 youre exactly the type of this that us them guy your boy obama railed against in audacity of hope
1987709 but halfway through the interview the clarity i had in my head started to feel mushy and imprecise
1987710 as if oreilly and his ilk dont pound on and engender violent impulses toward liberals every day from their pulpits
1987711 isnt that exactly what you do every day of the week bill havent you made an entire career out of it you engage in inflammatory rhetoric just because it feels good and you have a much larger audience than i do so whats the problem here
1987712 and mjs what is wrong with you i would genuinely like to know youre exactly the type of this that us them guy your boy obama railed against in audacity of hope

1987720 we are here to win the tournament and the draw does not matter or who we play first
1987721 we are still capable of winning matches people say that we are over the hill i dont see any hill in front we are playing top quality tennis
1987722 there are some great doubles teams playing each other in the first round we are lucky to be seeded they have to show some consistency as it is the first time the singles ranking has been considered for doubles seeding they dont do that even in grand slams

1987733 but i wrote a book and next thing it became an international bestseller and i didnt expect that
1987734 it had what you might call a mixed reaction in limerick i was promised my throat would be slit if i ever came back here but my throat is still intact so maybe they were just joking
1987735 i did ask him before to come on the tour and he said mike i wrote the book
1987736 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant they think its funny that theyre making fun of something thats true
1987737 ill be honest if it seems like political news has taken something of a backseat around here of late its mainly because the recent developments on the campaign trail tire gauges paris hilton and the like just seem so inordinately stupid to me not to mention so woefully desperate by the mccain campaign that ive had trouble mustering up the level of outrage to even post about them

1987781 i tried to explain to republican leader john boehner that sure it was fun to jam democrats on gas prices last friday but maybe it was time to get back to our normal august schedule of flying all around the world for free on military transports and getting drunk with sub cabinet ministers from exotic countries
1987782 but he said that for whatever reason our little spur of the moment stunt was the first thing wed done in years thats energized our republican base so now we gotta stick around and pretend that congress actually has the power to lower gas prices for the entire month thanks for ruining my summer vacation moron constituents
1987783 i hope that jesus forgives me for pretending to believe that my inane speeches here might somehow lower gas prices but i doubt thatll happen not after i claimed that kids were dying from cancer because nancy pelosi wouldnt support drilling for oil in alaska

1987813 by stirring up fears of higher monthly bills this posturing attempts to delegitimize the commissions worthy action giving consumers the false impression that they must choose between secret internet blocking or the very undesirable practice of metering
1987814 this is a false choice one most providers dont even consider necessary or practical these scare tactics shouldnt deter anyone from pursuing the policies we need to preserve a free and open internet

1987829 everybody congregated to the music of the grateful dead the philosophy of the grateful dead the community of the grateful dead
1987830 and here we have it a gillion years later and everyone still wants to do the same thing and that is congregate around good music and a like minded philosophy it never ceases to amaze me that this prolonged experience that i first experienced back in 1971 is still as vibrant or more its right here

1987835 from 30 june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp license
1987836 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
1987837 looking into the crystal ball i dont think businesses will see much value in upgrading to vista until late next year and even so microsoft will probably have come out with something else by then

1987843 for the most part these social networking sites should be viewed as complementary to your online presence think of it as a nice to have not a must have
1987844 when used properly it is something that can gain your business some attention however you need to realize it shouldnt be seen as a replacement to your traditional online presence
1987845 sites such as linkedin can be helpful in connecting with people you want to meet for one reason or another twitter and facebook can be helpful when youre trying to notify a group of people about something you want to promote or about a happening of some kind
1987846 the viral nature of social networking is quite extraordinary and something that can garner a lot of attention to your efforts in a hurry
1987847 the site requires some r sum creation then offers the opportunity to link in to other like minded professionals when used selectively it can be a very powerful tool for identifying new business partners new employees or simply building your personal or business presence

1987885 yellowstone bison interagency plan ibmp and agencies management need improvement to better address bison cattle brucellosis controversy
1987886 the meeting process had its faults the public could not pose questions to the presenters about what they were presenting on and the handouts the agencies had were for themselves and not the public though they said this would go up on the web site they are working on one bison advocate made a good point that most of the best ideas come from the public while other bison advocates including gallatin wildlife association and natural resource and defense council representatives did a very good job of covering the flaws shaming the agencies and raising their passions for wild buffalo

1987892 in this context it is important to underline nigerias role as a regional power which would normally mean that nigeria would invest more in infrastructure not just for itself but also to serve the needs of the region

1987901 the thing ive always loved about the gibbon is that hes just such a loser
1987902 what i began to realize as i was working with him is that he knows going into a situation that things arent usually going to work out the way he wants them to generally things work out the exact opposite way but he still gives it the old college try then when things turn out bad he says yeah thats what i thought was going to happen but it doesnt stop him from trying next time and i really like that about the character
1987903 all i can say is we kind of cover that question
1987904 in this story theres some question to whether or not hes a mutant
1987905 he narrates the story and says something along the lines of they say when life give you lemons make lemonade but all life gives me is banana peels and thats really his life right there
1987906 things are going so bad for him that he actually volunteers for a superhuman study at state university because he figures no one else is very interested in him
1987907 shes a new character shes working at state university reed richards old alma mater and in fact shes the recipient of the reed richards fellowship there so shes some sort of genius she has a working knowledge of just about every field of science like reed but shes not on reeds level
1987908 one of the things shes playing around with in the back of her mind is dimensional frequencies and she tests out one of her theories on the gibbon it goes horribly awry and sends our characters into the ape world
1987909 when an idea hits her shes like oh ive got to check this out right now theres a difference between being intelligent and having common sense and i think shes a good example of that
1987910 im sure over the course of history in the ape universe theres been real similarities and correlations to events in the marvel universe but its definitely not exact
1987911 there are some characters in the ape universe who do not exist in the marvel universe and vice versa for instance there doesnt seem to be a gibbon in the ape universe and there are characters like ape x who exists in the ape universe but dont seem to exist in the marvel universe or maybe we should say dont yet exist in the marvel u there have been at least a few major differences in terms of events that i dont want to go into because it would give too much away but certain characters like doctor strange have not survived in the ape universe for various reasons
1987912 a lot them have names that make you laugh when you say them out loud
1987913 spider monkey is the most obvious iron mandrill then comes on real quick but you dont want to overuse that with characters like power mandrill and others theres only so many super powered mandrills that you can have
1987914 i really enjoyed iron paw who can make his paw like a thing of iron the great thing about that is when ramon bachs draws him using his iron paw hes actually using one of his feet i thought it was hilarious
1987915 we did a promo piece that was a takeoff on the one more day storyline in spider man
1987916 theres a little bit of globetrotting but not a lot
1987917 if we ever go back and i certainly hope we do id love to see versions of latveria atlantis all of those places
1987918 hes admired and liked and considered quite good looking he really likes it there for a short while
1987919 but then something happens and he becomes very very concerned with getting home as quickly as possible and hopefully in one piece and thats really what the rest of the story is about
1987920 when the gibbon is exposed to this experimental ray there is some question as to why they end up in this world of apes he even wonders in one issue that if they trained the ray on fiona would they have ended up on a world filled with women probably not
1987921 so there is some question about if he has a connection to this place then his question becomes is this where i really belong
1987922 hes a big gorilla wearing a magical mexican wrestling mask
1987923 hes a kirby style character a big brawler who throws people through walls and blast energy from his hands hes just a really fun character and you cant go wrong with a gorilla in a mexican wrestling mask
1987924 i was trying to figure out some back story for the ape x character and i have a brother in law who in high school and college was quite the wrestler he was a state champion in oregon
1987925 his name is roy reyna and i thought what a great comic book name
1987926 im a firm believer in the joss whedon approach if things are tense and you make a joke its funnier and if youre telling jokes and than something horrible happens its even more horrible i think thats a great way to write stories
1987927 when he has the ape captain america leaning forward on his desk hes leaning on his knuckles
1987928 i never said that in the script ramon just keyed in on that real quickly his ape body language is really good plus with the characters being monkeys and apes he can be a little more expressive and cartoony with the faces than he would be if he was drawing a book like the avengers
1987929 he just did a page with wolverine and he gave him that weird haircut but still made him look like a monkey
1987930 he was serious the idea had stuck with joe but i believe wacker had seen some drawings mike wieringo had done of various marvel characters as apes and that put the idea in his head as well
1987931 somehow joe and steve came together and it became a real project and they gave me a call
1987932 i wrote up a proposal and the good news was that joe was very interested in this project that was also the bad news because it meant that joe was very interested in this project
1987933 he was very involved in the shaping of it we went through a few different versions of the proposal before we hammered things out to everyones liking
1987934 i personally would love to do more with ape x i also think it would be fun to bring some of those characters into the marvel universe and vice versa
1987935 in one version of the proposal one of the major players was the red ghost if you threw him into the ape world it would be very interesting to see what would happen and of course if we did some more maybe i could play a little with gorilla man theres just a ton of possibilities we havent even scratched the surface yet
1987936 that parents feel compelled to monitor their children on this scale should send a powerful message to the big social networking sites
1987937 with three quarters of a million underage users in the uk myspace and bebo need to take their own age restriction policies far more seriously to help allay parents real fears
1987938 children are at the vanguard of the social networking phenomenon using sites such as facebook and
1987939 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
1987940 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
1987941 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
1987942 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm

1987944 i guess the redeem team is right we didnt do so well in 2004
1987945 we look for the opportunity to rekindling that flame and being the best in the world
1987946 we have more experienced guys and we have guys who understand and know what it takes to be an olympian and part of team usa i dont think we understood what it meant to put on a usa uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004 we definitely know that now
1987947 i dont think we were complacent we just didnt know what it took to be an olympian
1987948 watch us on sunday well show you what it takes
1987949 i was a throwaway on the 2004 olympic team because a lot of guys said no
1987950 i made this three year commitment to be a part of this and i know im going to be playing a big role on our side to win a gold medal
1987951 this means more than sitting at home and getting two more months of rest
1987952 it means more to me than playing for my respective team because im not just playing for a community im not just playing for cleveland akron or the state of ohio im playing for every state in america
1987953 we grew up thinking about the nba title but being an olympian is something i grew up never thinking about thats why at the beginning i never knew what it meant but now i do i think an olympic title and an nba title are equivalent to each other theyre both great
1987954 growing up you never think of any other league except for the nba
1987955 thats all ive seen but things are changing really fast you never know i cant throw all my eggs in one basket theres a lot of opportunities and there will be a lot of opportunities for me in 2010 if i want to stay with cleveland or if i want to go elsewhere could i ever imagine it no is it a possibility yes
1987956 it takes that kind of incentive and that kind of promotion in order for the fledgling energy industries to really thrive and we are really just at the beginning of what we can do

1987968 the commissions report was excellent in every respect and it is only because it was so good that i am able to step down now at this time
1987969 evidence of unchallenged party political comments being made at institute events by politicians and also party political comments made by or on behalf of the institute combined with the predominant involvement of labour party politicians in the institutes activity compromised the institutes independence bearing in mind the previous engagement between the commission and the trustees in 2001 02 on this matter the commission concluded that the trustees had not safeguarded or adequately supervised the risks posed to the independence and reputation of the institute the trustees had allowed the institute to become exposed to concerns that is supported government policy and was involved in party political activity inappropriate for a charity
1987970 not sufficiently engaged to ensure the proper supervision of the charity

1987987 if the danger of the reproduction of that curse of god in the jewish blood is to finally come to an end then there is only one way the extermination of that people whose father is the devil
1987988 whoever does what a jew does is a scoundrel a criminal and he who repeats and wishes to copy him deserves the same fate annihilation death
1987989 it is usually found at the bottom of the river and tends only to appear when other species of crayfish have moved on
1987990 although only turkish crayfish have been affected so far we think it will be only a matter of time before it spreads to the native species and that would be a disaster there are no native crayfish left in the colne but there are still some remnants in the river stour and the river chelmer
1987991 one possible route for the spread of this disease is use of unlicenced crayfish traps the idea of this wild food is much in vogue
1987992 while this is safe to do in parts of the country where native crayfish have already been wiped out in the east of england we are trying to protect one of the last strongholds

1987999 not only is moveon orgs anti drilling position out of step with 70 percent of americans but a member like mike conaway who represents the texas oil patch will probably see his approval rating surge upward as a result of these ads

1988004 the facts in this matter seem clear one boy killed another in a climate of intolerance and fear about sexual orientation and gender expression the alleged perpetrator who turned 14 years old less than three weeks before the shooting should be held accountable for his actions but we support the principles underlying our juvenile justice system that treat children differently than adults and provide greater hope and opportunity for rehabilitation

1988015 fluoride lowers thyroid function fluoride damages the bone and fluoride lowers iq all of these have been demonstrated in india and china
1988016 theyve brought together six top experts who have carefully looked at all of the details and they have come to a very clear result that there is not a link that would suggest fluoride is going to cause the problems that some people would suggest
1988017 the fluoride gets incorporated into the enamel of the tooth at the time that the tooth is forming so this makes a stronger coating on the tooth which is more resistant to decay right from the very start

1988323 i am looking forward to playing alongside him of course i am torres is the kind of striker that anyone would want to play alongside
1988324 he makes great runs holds the ball up well to allow support to get around him and when he gets the chance in front of goal he is deadly

1988379 in january 2004 obama said he supported eliminating criminal penalties for marijuana use in the oct 30 2007 presidential debate he joined other democratic candidates in opposing the decriminalization of marijuana
1988380 at a time when the surge appears to be working is that the right time to try and set time tables for withdrawing all american troops
1988381 and you pull out according to that time table regardless of the situation even if theres serious sectarian violence
1988382 ten years ago when obama was running for statewide office in an exclusive chicago district he opposed the death penalty he now supports the ultimate penalty
1988383 during the recent obama pander tour the presumptive democratic nominee unnecessarily endorsed president bushs faith based initiative a sort of patronage program that rewards religious activists for their political support with public grants

1988399 fully understanding the social and political canadian reality implies a deep awareness of its complexity it also implies that the researcher will take into consideration the works related to the object of research without systematically ignoring a significant proportion of scholarly work particularly emanating from another linguistic universe
1988400 if canada as a political community and a national community as is used widely in the vocabulary of english canada is composed of two global societies scholarly production related to it must reflect this reality if it wishes to be inclusive and comprehensive

1988416 the batteries were all standard issue and rather dull but i didnt half enjoy myself acting out elaborate battery eating scenarios with this cheery chap and his big hinged mouth please dont use my real name as the wife probably wouldnt like to know the terribly unromantic details of the hours preceding the big occasion xxxx xxxxxxx

1988432 i didnt have a business relationship with him at any time during the rice project
1988433 i would think he would disclose that or tell other council members do i wish on a personal basis he would have told me yes
1988434 i think we all should have been apprised of that but the way the vote went it wouldnt have had a bearing on it anyway
1988435 i would have told him if he asked me at the time that i would not have considered it a conflict of interests to vote on at the time
1988436 theres no law rule regulation of any kind that i can think of that would require that to be disclosed
1988437 one of the difficulties of these conflict of interest questions always is determining whether or not the people involved are operating in good faith
1988438 it could be an error if one is willing to give the benefit of doubt
1988439 but its certainly worthy of a deeper investigation for no other reason than this is why people are cynical about their government

1988668 japan doubled its gold medal tally korea had a good medal tally and china came quite close to the in terms of gold medals i expect the rise of asia in general to continue and this of course will include china
1988669 in 1984 we were worried if they would come and when they came our first reaction was gratitude
1988670 the second reaction when they won the first event was wow these guys are good
1988671 watching in 1984 i clearly expected them to be a dominant team in the olympic games for many many years
1988672 were going to do our best were not used to being the summer olympic underdog but well get used to it and try our best
1988673 certainly the majority of the pollsters are picking china to win the medal count
1988674 we certainly believe they have a strong team we have a strong team we think the competition is wonderful it gives us something to shoot at and it bolsters our efforts makes us focus our resources and makes us get better

1988712 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1988713 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign

1988717 new versions itunes and the iphone software could theoretically eliminate this problem by syncing only the metadata or tiny files containing the barebones attributes of each media item or playlist but not the content itself from a users itunes library to their portable devices
1988718 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1988719 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1988720 this is a rampant problem across the whole retail industry
1988721 i would say half the retail networks today are extremely vulnerable from a wireless perspective
1988722 a lot of stores just set wi fi up and forgot about it
1988723 but thats not how security has evolved hacking has evolved where fences are not high enough upgrading wireless technology in a large retail establishment with 3 000 stores could be a costly effort but has to be done
1988724 these systems werent built with security in mind and when they were rolled out there werent cybercriminals this sophisticated
1988725 i dont think its practical to expect retailers to plug every hole certainly they can deal with the sloppy holes theyve made a lot of progress with pci compliance but the blame has to go around a little bit its also the banks problem the point of sale systems are owned by the banks and they need to upgrade their payment systems architecture
1988726 you need to monitor your database and provide some security mechanism when it looks like an abundance of data is being downloaded in one sql statement
1988727 the stores werent monitoring their own logs there are plenty of tools out there that look for that kind of activity so it can be stopped
1988728 what we preach is a multilayered security environment to secure your database your apps and your access points so if someone did get past your wireless access point you have a second tier of security to look for someone deploying a trojan horse
1988729 make sure you have wireless monitoring and intrusion detection deployed to make sure no rogue devices try to connect to your network
1988730 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping

1988758 the bush administrations disregard of faa workers rights has put the safety of our aviation system at risk
1988759 the administrations heavy handed tactics have forced experienced air traffic controllers out the door in record numbers its time we treat these workers with the respect they deserve
1988760 passage of this bill will provide the incentive for controllers to remain on the boards so the safety of the flying public can be restored
1988761 the economy and the credit equity markets are anything but a walk in the park these days but hey this isnt a game for amateurs and this cycle will most certainly show us who a understands the big picture b knows how to measure risk and c knows how to preserve capital
1988762 folks are starting to figure out that traditional long only investing means that you have to be invested for a long time i have no problem with that philosophy provided your time horizon is 100 years and you dont mind 15 to 17 year periods where you dont make any money like the one were in now frankly i have yet to meet an investor with a 100 year time horizon and the patience to sit through a secular bear market in stocks and the volatility that goes with it
1988763 i believe the correct posture is one of caution not to be confused with being bearish i believe that every bet one makes must be measured and have considerable thought behind it its truly okay to miss opportunities but the big cyclical moves even within secular bear markets must be had the same is true for cyclical bear moves within secular bull markets which i believe could be a result of a combination of both time and price i do believe one thing for sure the sun will definitely come out tomorrow i just have to be around with my capital and my investors capital to take advantage of the sunshine
1988764 i believe time in the market with proper asset allocation is preferable to
1988765 unless you are a professional market timer which if you think about it is an oxymoron you should be using stocks for their most logical purpose long term investing and your investment portfolio should be allocated in such a way that allows you to respond similarly when someone comments on the market news of the day
1988766 the main portion about 100 bottles was found on the eastbound side in a three mile stretch called three mile hill between milepost 356 and 359
1988767 this area is prone to this problem because commercial trucks are driving at a slow speed and drivers can urinate into bottles and toss them out the window

1988773 the deadlock was inevitable in fact it was unavoidable given the gulf between the political parties including the two mdc factions
1988774 there are differences in terms of perceptions and understanding of issues among the three parties in the negotiations the differences are too wide and too deep
1988775 the sticking issues pertain to the position of tsvangirai what role he is going to play in any arrangement
1988776 one cannot rule out deadlock in talks of this nature the discussion is about power and involves political parties that are far apart
1988777 what i seem to read is that the mdc wants an executive prime minister post for tsvangirai but zanu pf is bent on giving him a ceremonial role
1988778 the logjam can still be unlocked the other reference groups in the mediation process could be handy in breaking the impasse
1988779 there are traditional strategists especially those from the south african and kenyan experiences these may give a hand
1988780 i think at the end of it all the three parties may come to a compromise zanu pf badly needs an urgent agreement due to the bad state of the country economically politically and otherwise
1988781 the deadline was too ambitious we are looking at a fortnight if not more the haggling is going to take long as long as these contentious issues are not ironed out courtesy of some compromises
1988782 we are hoping to launch the bold before 1st november
1988783 we expect there will be many opportunities for collaboration on investments in the future
1988784 the public have every right to be concerned about the growth of this sort of violence
1988785 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and it has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
1988786 the pain that martins death has caused for our family is indescribable
1988787 we as a family will never make sense of the unnecessary suffering that was inflicted upon martin
1988788 life will never be the same a piece of our heart has been taken
1988789 this was a vengeful attack out of all proportion to what may have gone before and no mercy was shown
1988790 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
1988791 we are just hoping that the people who have been involved with martins murder will learn from what has happened to martin
1988792 vmware has been focusing on standardisation efforts much more seriously of late they realise that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditised or near commoditised and like every other virtualisation vendor theyre eyeing virtualisation management as the source of green field revenue

1988801 warner music chief edgar bronfman misses the point that there is significant value added by activision and his comments reflect his lack of understanding about the business
1988802 in games the actual royalty derived from the use of a song or the royalty derived from the download of a song remain in my estimation far below what their true value is
1988803 i think that mr bronfmans characterization as paltry is his reaction to the
1988804 however his flip comment disregards that the songs downloaded on guitar hero are
1988805 the value of the music is near zero without the game file and nobody downloads guitar hero content to play on their ipod
1988806 as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
1988807 the other thing i find interesting is mr bronfmans distorted view of his leverage in this matter activision isnt operating a music download service where consumers get to choose whatever they want instead
1988808 thus activision can select songs not published by warner music so mr bronfman should rethink his negotiating leverage
1988809 what we need to be very careful of is that the recorded music industry and the music publishing industry do not allow an ecosystem to occur where we are not properly compensated
1988810 for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged
1988811 there have always been people willing to pay for the mac experience and ignore those who would tell them something else is just as good what youre seeing is an increase in the number of people who believe a mac is worth it some of us have felt that if more people would really try a mac theyd feel the same way and clearly its happening
1988812 os x is worth the 700 difference easy as near as i can tell unscientifically from talking to my pc using friends the 2 days month they spend dealing with windows bs compared to the two hours i spend each month dealing with os x bs yes theres some immediately pays for the difference within the first month if my time is worth 50 hour
1988813 macs other than the macpro are expensive for the hardware you get and arguably cheap for the software you get if you value the software and youre not out to buy the cheapest thing that will get you by then there is a value argument for macs on the other hand if you somehow need every possible gb of ram random access memory and hard drive and gpu graphics processing unit performance youll never beat a hand built windows or linux pc unless you factor in the cost of your time to select components do the assembly recover from the missteps etc
1988814 i think every pc company builds a quality product using quality components and often the same manufacturing partners
1988815 no one sets out to build a poor quality pc you build a product that supports the price point you target and provides the margins that your company needs to generate to be a successful enterprise apple hp dell no one builds a lower quality pc you cant sell defective memory or processors and hard drives are pretty much the same the difference is in the functionality which i think is a totally different concept than quality you can use more functional components that offer new features and have added costs which is mostly how we differentiate a 1 500 pc from a 500 one and not the build quality
1988816 photos rotate soon after iphone is tilted faster than 2 0
1988817 it is an industry standard to have a changelog or version history which lists all items changed and added
1988818 for example 1password a mac password manager just came out with an update take a look at its long list fixes to get the idea for apple to be vague and state bug fixes is not right what bugs which ones sometimes not all are fixed or even acknowledged a changelog helps users know what has in fact been changed
1988819 why apple choses not to reveal whats in its changes is really lending more to its over secrecy issue people say the bush administration is secretive sheesh apple is beyond ridiculous maybe apple doesnt want to reveal security issues it fixes and thus just doesnt note them
1988820 theres no reason to hide corrects app store update issue where iphone updates are not seen on itunes 7 7 x for example thats just plain silly
1988821 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1988822 does anyone else think that this was really just a press release that was sent out in the form of a leaked internal email
1988823 good to hear they are taking this seriously but on the other side mobileme is actually a very good service people who think they can do better with free services must just not use the services the new push sync services are great photo sharing is top notch and general web publishing couldnt be easier but probably the single most valuable service for me and what makes everything else really work is the idisk

1988825 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
1988826 can you cite one legislative accomplishment that senator mccain produced during those 26 years in washington in order to achieve energy independence
1988827 well im not a historian that goes through all of the pieces of legislation john mccain has worked on
1988828 im not one who believes that we need to subsidize things
1988829 life in the spotlight must be grand for obama but for the rest of us including mccain times are tough
1988830 from the 30th of june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp licence
1988831 however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
1988832 if they owe us money we are going to get it
1988833 its certainly our position we want to work with immigration but as a local agency we are not in the business of enforcing immigration law
1988834 i then inquired about the csp task force that was formed for this issue
1988835 they only act as a type of liaison between police and ice
1988836 we cant respond to calls within city limits this is a problem for all of us in law enforcement if we responded to every call it would require resources we dont have
1988837 ice responds to the vast majority of calls from local jurisdictions on rare occasions we dont have the manpower to spare
1988838 you exceeded the allowed 0 simultaneous users you can enter a new license run in demo mode or quit
1988839 in an economic downturn it defies belief that billions of pounds should be spent locking up more and more people only to turn them out of jail homeless jobless and ready to offend again
1988840 right now the prison population is mushrooming out of control and the government is still trying hopelessly to build its way out of a crisis
1988841 there is nothing smart about stacking up prisoners in overcrowded jails it leads to more not less offending on release it is not tough on crime it is tough on the rest of us
1988842 the answer is not to build more prisons as they would soon themselves fill up

1988851 ncaa football 09 has taught us a couple of lessons that pre orders are not quite the key indicator that they may have been in the past and secondly they shouldnt be seen as being any kind of sales indicator in the first couple of weeks

1988857 there are a couple of things that we are looking at again whether they make sense right now
1988858 weve got a fairly long term product plan laid out and were going to try to stick with that
1988859 on our site we have found the gift reminders service effectively reduces your competition before today if the shopper cannot remember the web site where they saw a product theyll usually do a google search which immediately opens the door for your competition
1988860 your chance of converting that consumer just got a lot harder
1988861 this would be a great gift for moms b day
1988862 im sure it will work better for sites like ours that sell merchandise that is often bought for gifts
1988863 but you never know it could also help people who sell seasonal items or even those who sell stuff that people buy in a timely matter say when they have a baby or remodel a home

1988878 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1988879 on the other you have the democrats who see future votes if they can just get those illegals the right to vote im sure that plan is in the works

1988902 get that claw hammer out of your butt and have some fun this site has a lot of sexual repression especially among the right wingers so it comes out as gay jokes
1988903 gay jokes are the height of internet comedy and not at all worn out and overused at all no sir
1988904 i guess i shouldve gone into something more lucrative and less service oriented
1988905 when you choose to not answer it is because you get cornered quite often actually and you have no response
1988906 yet you added that when you were in a chamber you engaged in wage fixing discussions with fellow like businesses
1988907 spewing more pure drivel i see provide a link or someone that has ever been in a chamber of commerce meeting where fixing wages was a topic or was discussed
1988908 the companies can join the chamber of commerce and other organizations to get together and fix wages benefits etc
1988909 personal experience i used to own my own business and had discussions about wages with other owners of similar shops often

1988912 gas station tv informed the campaign this afternoon that the company will not run ads that are damaging to oil companies
1988913 once again the oil companies and their friends are standing with senator mccain the candidate for president who is proposing to offer them a 4 billion tax cut
1988914 it looks like gas station tv doesnt want the american people to know about senator obamas plan to offer working families a 1 000 energy rebate that would be funded by a tax on oil company profits the oil companies have taken sides in this race and they are standing with john mccain because they know hes been in washington for 26 years and can be counted on to pursue for another four years of the bush energy policy thats made them billions of dollars
1988915 gas station tv shall publish content that is fair and open minded we will air objective and even handed content gas station tv will never promote a particular view on controversial matters of public policy or political or industrial controversy
1988916 its a sort of mixed bag of nerves and excitement really
1988917 i was brought up as an eisteddfodwr and the robes are so unique it has a big effect on you as a child
1988918 its fantastic to come home to cardiff to the home town where the eisteddfod is and to be accepted into the gorsedd its a great honour
1988919 the honour is double or 10 times more when you hear the names of those who have gone before you and the things they have achieved its humbling to be in their number
1988920 we are both extremely proud of the honour the eisteddfod has given matthew words cannot really describe how we both feel today
1988921 we said then and were saying now that were continuing to explore opportunities to work with chrysler but we dont have anything to announce right now
1988922 the chrysler small car will be made at a nissan plant in japan while chrysler will make the pickup truck at its plant in mexico to go on sale in 2011

1988936 it is shocking to see how poorly some restaurants are doing
1988937 before the only thing a restaurant cared about was not getting closed if they were open people didnt know how it had scored now people see the grade and the inspections are all unannounced
1988938 weve got to save something for future wolfensteins we cant do him in yet
1988939 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present the evidence to a jury to determine whether the evidence establishes dr ivins guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
1988940 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins

1988943 yc startups are or tend to be better than non yc startups
1988944 techcrunch is lazy and chooses the yc startups because theyre obviously better than whatever else theyre sorting through
1988945 in employee reviews managers often have very little idea of what an employee has done
1988946 prior to that they worked in large consulting companies where they derived the idea for their newest project
1988947 in the second decade of the twentieth century it was almost impossible to build an airplane in the united states
1988948 when something you own is necessary to the success of a venture even if its contribution is small youll tend to ask for an amount close to the full value of the venture and since everyone in your position also thinks he deserves a huge sum the venture quickly becomes unviable
1988949 the whole experience was inspiring and i look forward to sharing it with flashforward attendees what was clear from the conversations i had with this group is that their work is not only driven by passion but the quality of the work is also shaped by it
1988950 passion isnt something you can teach others but it certainly is infectious
1988951 to create work without passion is a season in hell
1988952 there is content everywhere but to find it you have to open up your third eye and see things as if youre seeing them for the very first time
1988953 an international train from krakow to prague ran into a collapsed bridge which fell on the rails in the area of the town studenka
1988954 there are some dead but we do not have precise numbers because our people are rather devoting time to rescue those still alive
1988955 all staff have been called to service and we have freed a number of beds to make room for the injured
1988956 i travel by this train once a week when im travelling to school and its always so overcrowded that there isnt even a place for standing
1988957 hello i have a treat for you in the form of some unusual batteries known simply as 555 they dont even sport any english on their bodies or packaging their quality surpasses mere language
1988958 here they are in their natural state whoever works in the 555 factory needs a slap as theyve made the basic error of not angling the batteries so the name is visible through the blister pack perhaps you are now gazing in disbelief at the price are they really only 50p do you want confirmation
1988959 consider it confirmed 10p per battery you literally cant go wrong the back of the packet has further treats
1988960 beautiful layout including signage indicating where to cut with scissors in order to separate the batteries into their individual sections theres even more to be gleaned here as a closer inspection reveals
1988961 yes theyve got a mascot a bit like the ebf one in addition it appears as if at least 16 013 units have been shipped although thanks to your work against sony we all know that this does not necessarily mean 16 013 units have been sold lets crack one of these bad boys out of its cage
1988962 observant readers may notice that the cell is actually a bit deformed it was essentially broken out of the box the misshape is not due to any lens defect on my camera and ill fight anyone that says it is still 10p per battery is a bargain unless an even more detailed look will unveil the real reason behind the price
1988963 a ha the truth theyre past their best they probably still work a bit but im not willing to test them for fear of having an explosion in my face ill keep the rest in their packs time capsule style for future generations
1988964 i hope you enjoyed this little adventure at 358 words its not insignificant lee
1988965 i wont be needing a bag for this thank you
1988966 i like to think that it makes the other customers feel just a little bad about the five plastic bags they have entwined in their fingers
1988967 it is a lot more likely that no one notices and id be grateful if you didnt ruin it for me
1988968 one of the most significant factors determining whether people give to charity is their beliefs about what others are doing those who make it known that they give to charity increase the likelihood that others will do the same
1988969 green minded parisians ride beaucoup beaucoup scooters that emit more toxins than most cars and drop cigarette butts anywhere everywhere if your city doesnt recycle glass and many dont then always buy cans or plastic its easier than you think if you just think first
1988970 put as much as you can in as few bags as possible
1988971 nothings coming to my mind and i have no idea what to write about
1988972 ich bin zum gl ck bisher noch kein opfer von korruption geworden

1988977 here is a place you can move to if you hate america as much as obama and his wife do
1988978 obama goes to europe and bad mouths the usa and his wife says that she is ashamed of america
1988979 sit down and shut the fuck up when youre on an airplane
1988980 jesus was one cool motherfucker if you read his writings
1988981 i know many persons who go through more than that lady did on a daily basis why is she entitled to wealth because she has discomfort passing waste
1988982 wtf did i miss the part in the story where she was sodomized by the preachers wife
1988983 i received a telephone call last night thursday telling me i was the next to die
1988984 we will not give up we will not let the insecurity prevent us from helping somali people who are in urgent need of aid
1988985 it seems there is an anti aid worker campaign going on in the afgoye area it looks like the attackers want the aid workers expelled from the region for insecurity to reign
1988986 kariye was one of those who organised the protests over the increase in attacks on aid workers he may have become a target as a result
1988987 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
1988988 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
1988989 the death of tens of civilians in bomb and mortar attacks in mogadishu in the past week the current massive displacement of civilians due to fighting in beletweyne and the latest killing of an aid worker underline the toll conflict is taking on civilian populations and the relief operation
1988990 all this is occurring in the context of a severely deteriorating humanitarian situation in which aid workers themselves subject to attacks in increasing numbers are more and more challenged to reach people with the assistance they require
1988991 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
1988992 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years
1988993 adults find it very shocking and kids are like that stinks theyre so desensitized they have no idea what the ethical issues are they wish there was water spraying in their face
1988994 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
1988995 our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits
1988996 estamos decepcionados por el hecho de que ir n se ha negado una vez m s a dar a javier solana una respuesta clara al generoso paquete de incentivos del grupo 5 1
1988997 no hay otra elecci n que impulsar nuevas sanciones contra ir n
1988998 la cuesti n planteada era clara y llamaba a una respuesta simple de ir n acepta ir n la oferta de una doble v para entablar negociaciones
1988999 mantendremos abiertas todas las v as para la continuaci n de los contactos con ir n con el fin de aclarar su postura
1989000 though the legislation of summer time is being pushed through its still inappropriate for working level officials to discuss the matter
1989001 nor is david davis a libertarian witness his views on drugs and his voting record on gays
1989002 so he dont like druggies and queers well more power to his elbow then the rise and acceptance of these repulsive practices is what is bringing our civilisation to its knees
1989003 we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history the stage of rule by brute force
1989004 most greens are she and her co author chas newkey burden says pious sexless contemptuous of humankind posh and rich having found in environmentalism a new excuse for lecturing the poor telling other people to live by rules they dont apply to themselves
1989005 yes david you are a clever boy now fix me a g amp t theres a good boy
1989006 nl tories and fibdums are all part of the problem the only answer is the libertarian party
1989007 al jazeera aired the pictures and the written demands but then cut the next scene it shows the 18 men trussed up and blindfolded in front of a ditch a hooded man then fires into the back of one of their heads and along with other men off camera goes from one body to the next firing again and again some of the victims are still alive their legs kicking and the hooded man goes to each one and fires again into their heads then in the background a bearded youth approaches the camera holding an islamic flag he is singing
1989008 it is quite clear from those that have seen the film that it is certainly not suitable for young children
1989009 everyone seems to have missed it but the boris johnson win in london wasnt based on a trad tory agenda or a nulab one it was vigorously libertarian let the people decide give charitable groups the means to sort out problems lower taxes less intervention
1989010 libertarians on this blog dont seem very happy seem more like grumpy old men
1989011 anon 11 17 you are a social worker or a teacher arentcha come on tell ya uncle ricky its okay nothing to be ashamed about
1989012 telling other people to live by rules they dont apply to themselves
1989013 give me your money or i will call you a selfish bastard
1989014 were grumpy because people dont leave us the fuck alone
1989015 but this isnt a kid friendly action movie full of the bams and pows of the original series
1989016 so it seems to me complaining about the certification is quite legitimate
1989017 you are missing the point guido those that have seen the film think that the 12a rating is inappropriate many parents will trust the rating and believe it is fit for children of all ages to see
1989018 personally id pay more tax to have more police on the streets better drugs on the nhs and no failing schools
1989019 old holborn taxes are the price we voluntarily pay to live in the country we choose to live in if you object to the cost of making this country better then you should fuck off thats market logic isnt it
1989020 personally id pay more tax to have more police on the streets better drugs on the nhs and no failing schools
1989021 and who are the poor and needy in this country anyway no one starves to death thats poor and needy it happens in other countries not here no one in britain is short of drinking water no one lives on less than a dollar a day we have a minimum wage health care free at the point of use schooling ditto the poor in britain have a standard of living that the architects of the welfare state could only have dreamed of
1989022 this shell state that libertarians dream of is just vile in practice
1989023 personally i think that everyone should have to pay more tax
1989024 you prefer britain and id be surprised if that isnt partly because it what it offers you in public services
1989025 because the alternative this shell state that libertarians dream of is just vile in practice
1989026 but i also think its a horrible self fulfilling philiosophy that nothing can ever be improved by the state
1989027 whats that me ol sweetie gordo me ol bean me ol chum
1989028 lets put millions of pensioners into penury fail to educate children privatize anything that moves and ignore all the consequence initiate a war without objective and dance on the fact that the opposition are in meltdown over europe so it really doesnt matter what the hell we do
1989029 genuis gordo me ol fruit me ol bag of spanners me ol noose around the neck of history
1989030 greater good is it the majority of misinformed voting adults a single person so called experts or political parties having the so called mandate of the people and then doing as they so please
1989031 in fact rotten tomatoes which like the movie points out that
1989032 old holborn taxes are the price we voluntarily pay to live in the country we choose to live in if you object to the cost of making this country better then you should fuck off thats market logic isnt it
1989033 every country is filled to the brim with authoritarian cunts looking to control their people
1989034 we had charities and friendly socities before we had the welfare state
1989035 there are plenty of places you can go where the government wont take too close a look at what you get up to problem is that they are dirt poor which is why tossers like you wouldnt choose to live there
1989036 britain and america grew rapidly in the 19th century with a minimal state
1989037 there are plenty of places you can go where the government wont take too close a look at what you get up to problem is that they are dirt poor which is why tossers like you wouldnt choose to live there
1989038 the welfare state has done more damage to the family than anything else
1989039 deciding what someone else can see read amp hear is a perpetual dilemma
1989040 technology can get over the highest fence or though the thickest wall
1989041 like switzerland you mean not only the richest country in europe but also the happiest
1989042 the kids see what they want to see maybe you dont want them watching porn but they can pass around porn like sweets using their phones
1989043 oh yeah really libertarian switzerland is they still have national service in switzerland you know
1989044 daddy dizzy decides not big brother vaizey libertarians are fathers too
1989045 i want to do what i like but other people must do as i say
1989046 nobody here seems to be suggesting we get rid of the ratings system altogether so that parents can show their kids snuff movies and scat to their hearts content so i presume they are not quite that libertarian
1989047 his property his rules and if you dont like it dont go there
1989048 pursuant to the agreement atari interactive exercised an existing option to purchase and purchased from the company interplay intellectual property rights developed by the company in connection with the dungeons amp dragons games and the balance of all amounts due from the company to atari interactive under the note of approximately 1 050 000 00 was canceled and terminated
1989049 the red icon on your iphone or ipod touch always reminds you and others when you show it to them that you were able to afford this its a work of art with no hidden function at all
1989050 six people from the us one from germany and one from france dropped a grand for the gem in the first 24 hours it was available
1989051 you dont need to put pilots in a vehicle where you are only collecting data providing you can do it safely
1989052 thats going to drive savings in weight which will drive savings in fuel costs so where you see normal routine data gathering operations by manned aviation today i would see that gradually being transferred over to uavs in the next 20 years
1989053 it has a back up so we can take control of the vehicle if we need to and fly it manually
1989054 it tells you the difference between green crops that are photosynthesising and bare ground
1989055 the more dense the crop the less fertiliser you need to apply
1989056 we know you can get good maps of this sort from manned aircraft but its so difficult to get an aircraft to the field you need it in at the time you need it there and its also very expensive
1989057 we can see uavs extending a long way because we know that its useful for monitoring forestry and detecting disease in crops
1989058 never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway
1989059 only wimps use tape backup real men just upload their important stuff on ftp and let the rest of the world mirror it
1989060 its basically the couch potato experiment and it proves you can have a pharmacologic equivalent to exercise
1989061 exercise not only involves skeletal muscle fibers but the main muscle we depend on the heart
1989062 we arent seeing any particularly substantive moves down in price on the windows side either in desktops or notebooks
1989063 the windows folks dont have much good to say about their machines so they bad mouth apple
1989064 joe does indeed look at equivalent specced machines above an inspiron 518 and an imac
1989065 i think if the pc buyer added in the bluetooth the wi fi and the camera all things that many users actually want for todays computing applications and uses
1989066 this article is also deficient because it does not analyze the effect of resale you can buy a imac for 1400 and sell it for 700 three years later buy a pc for 700 and its worth maybe 200 three years later
1989067 the dell is easily upgraded bluetooth wi fi and webcam are extra cost options on the dell
1989068 the low end imac is very competitivly priced and it looks gorgeous
1989069 granted the mac mini starts at 599 but its sales volume is negligible
1989070 with a mac i am more productive so the price difference disappears in a few months
1989071 on sale at the local target one of them a 14 inch model the hp dv2946nr sold for 699 99 and packed 4gb of memory and a 320gb hard drive
1989072 if vista notebooks are selling for so little and packing so much how does this compare with mac desktops and notebooks
1989073 today i contacted stephen baker npds vice president of industry analysis about computer average selling prices at retail that hp notebook is right on mark asp for retail windows notebooks is 700 mac laptops 1 515 yeah right theyre more than twice as much
1989074 but theres more the asp for mac desktops is more than 1 000 greater than for windows pcs and mac desktop asps were higher in june than they were two years ago
1989075 that situation has dramatically changed in the last six months particularly the last three months
1989076 if apple is going to continue its market share gains or simply maintain that 8 5 percent u s share prices must go down and configurations bulk up the math is simply undeniable
1989077 dell had top notch support for years in fact they were the industry leader in support become big enough and support will go down it is simply the biggest expense
1989078 once you dive into the low end market like apple is apparently going to do they will either not afford the cost of tech support as it is or they will outsource it
1989079 tell us about the better security mac offers apple has done one thing that has allowed for an apparently more secure more stable os they have no past success no really ms has had to keep compatibility with older hardware and thus reliability can suffer
1989080 buy a new machine with vista x64 on it rock solid
1989081 for me it is a no brainer there is no way the mac is worth twice the cost of a pc in fact for me youd have to pay me to use a mac however i also recognize that there are people who are more interested in brand than value and the connection to a brand actually carries value in and of itself and i respect that
1989082 as for me i cant get beyond a mouse with one button on it plus i just enjoy windows over the mac os im a web developer and we do have a mac here at work for testing but nobody ever uses it
1989083 what i think is most interesting about this is that apple did used to avoid the bottom of the market and they held off on releasing the mini for many years if this article is correct then maybe they were right in doing so not only is it low margin but its low volume too probably the only real value apples gotten out of that is that they can probably re use a lot of their design work in the appletv although thats a low volume low margin device as well
1989084 our overall audit objective was to determine whether u s ground forces supporting operation iraqi freedom oif were receiving the training necessary to meet operational requirements specifically for this project we determined whether levels of training equipment at combat training centers ctcs were sufficient for ground forces training in support of oif

1989259 it is impossible to miss the historic coincidence of the games happening on the 30th anniversary of reform and opening which has permanently transformed china
1989260 after 30 years of opening up china not only could host the olympics but also host a very good one
1989261 we fear that our presence might cause stress for our son so we decided to just stay home and watch tv with our relatives
1989262 it is the greatest honor for an athlete to participate in the olympic games i am so proud of my son
1989263 im very happy to see so many friends from all over the world come to our country the olympics are a seed that grows friendship and peace
1989264 i have been going back and forth between london and guangzhou during the past few years i feel like i am already a part of china
1989265 the beijing olympics is a once in a lifetime experience for me i just want to watch the opening ceremony with the chinese people
1989266 the performance at the opening ceremony was just amazing i could really feel the atmosphere at the stadium even though we are far from beijing
1989267 i feel so honored to see the flame being lit at the olympic games main venue tonight this is an honor belonging to all mountaineers
1989268 we want to wish great success for the olympics in our own way
1989269 the olympics is a grand event to be enjoyed by everyone across the country we feel reassured about rebuilding our homes when we see the country is able to host the games even after the devastating quake
1989270 people are celebrating the opening of the olympics just as if it was a holiday
1989271 the opening ceremony performances are wonderful and they show the real china
1989272 tlg is hands down one of the best bands out there
1989273 i could walk up to kareena and do that but no i cant do that with katrina there is an awkwardness between katrina and me we dont talk to each other
1989274 ta amor rivero and go came into this olympics as medal favorites
1989275 im not the only one whos saying that the international federations know ahead of the olympics who the favorites in their respective events are
1989276 i would say that these two are well equipped to go as far as the shootoffs in their events
1989277 everything depends though on experience and luck you cant have one without the other
1989278 i need to borrow money from my family for all these trips
1989279 travel can affect drug compliance patients who dont get family support women who may not like to travel alone will just give up
1989280 ceo chris dewolfe and coo amit kapur have been interviewing people since late 2007
1989281 has found time to squeeze in a couple rounds of golf scores reported by boehner himself to a united states golf association site show that he posted an 85 sometime this week at his home course wetherington golf amp country club in west chester ohio
1989282 luckily i have a parrot cage and food so he can stay with me for the time being
1989283 im sure he must have an owner who is missing him as he is extremely friendly and has obviously been well cared for and taught to speak
1989284 he always gives me a good morning and a goodnight he also says give us a kiss and makes kissing noises
1989285 while both have increased from their low base as expected the overwhelming majority of the uks borrowers continue to pay their mortgages in full every month and will continue to do so
1989286 the cml is maintaining its forecast of 45 000 total possessions and 170 000 mortgages in arrears of more than three months by the end of the year
1989287 these numbers remain extremely small when seen in the context of the 11 74 million mortgages in the uk
1989288 in general terms while arrears and possessions rates have risen across the industry the impact of the credit crunch has hit the adverse credit sector harder than most of the mainstream market which continues to perform well
1989289 in the 1990s the problems people faced were high unemployment and high interest rates
1989290 we are making sure the right advice and support is available at the right time for the minority of borrowers who may need it at the moment because of global economic pressures
1989291 faced with stagnant earnings rocketing living costs and soaring mortgage bills the weight of debt is taking its toll on thousands of hard working families who stretched themselves to the limit to get on the property ladder and are now finding they can no longer make ends meet
1989292 in too many cases lenders are still not doing everything they can to help borrowers in trouble piling on extra charges not negotiating with borrowers to come to a workable solution over repayment arrangements and using court action as a first rather than a last resort
1989293 having a ds version would be an awesome way to keep interest alive and keep it going in addition to the next one mass effect 2
1989294 some gba games are better than 360 games or ps3 for that matter
1989295 in the 1980s when the hiv was identified for the first time the prevalence of the hiv aids among homosexuals was so high that the disease was called the gay plague the scenario changed and it showed that the virus and the disease can be how to say democratic affecting straight men women and children however scientific data have been showing that the prevalence of hiv aids among men who have sex with men msm is becoming higher and higher
1989296 a major reason for our lack of knowledge is the same reason why gay men and other msm are systematically ignored or downplayed in hiv prevention messages and funding and why gay men are subject to arrest imprisonment beatings and death in many parts of the globe homophobia stigma discrimination peter piot unaids executive director highlighted the public information campaigns of the mexican government health department against homophobia as noteworthy exceptions to most governments either ignoring homophobia or actively promoting it
1989297 i hoped this conference would be a turning point in the recognition of gay men msm in the countries where we officially dont exist or are jailed or beaten up or are just plain to scared to be open and i very much hope it will but its going to be a struggle i was reading elizabeth pisanis book the wisdom of whores on the way over and she has a lot of things so say about how the world adopted an aids affects everyone ideology because it was too scary and inconvenient to get politicians to do nice things for the people really affected namely their vulnerable communities or and ill go along with elizabeth in using the terms that dont appear in policy pronouncements their fags junkies and whores
1989298 thousands of people marched against homophobia beginning at the angel of independence on paseo de la reforma avenue in mexico citys gay business and continued down reforma and ended at the zocala in front of the m xicos presidential palace this was truly an international march because there were people from all over the world usa central and south america england europe asia and africa
1989299 just to see the banners on the mexico march ranging from the ones saying homophobia is a public health problem to the handwritten one carried by a middle aged lady that said in spanish and english im proud of my gay son gives me hope that the thing some of us have been most scared of and yet hoped for most a re gaying of the struggle against hiv but this time drawing in the energies of gay men msm from around the world may be starting to happen

1989326 from a developers point of view e3 has always been a lot of work but at same time a fun spectacle
1989327 it was something we would look at and get excited about because you see the competitions games and when you see all that stuff you walk away excited about the industry i didnt get that this year there wasnt the glitz of it all the spectacle the conversations you and i would have about oh you gotta go see rock band 2 you gotta go see god of war 3 that doesnt really exist that much and i do miss that part of it
1989328 to me theres excitement at leipzig when you see people and where the crowds are going i think you get a good pulse as to whats exciting in those shows thats a good element that could be added to e3 to accommodate that

1989349 we are happy to share with the world in these joyful moments but i am sad to see the big teams of many countries while our country is left behind with one of the smallest teams in the olympics
1989350 we had hoped that our country will participate with a large team in order to get good results in the games our interest in the olympics would have been greater
1989351 anyhow i will try not to miss the events they are in
1989352 we have waiting eagerly for this world event in iraq we are in desperate need for such issues in order to entertain ourselves and forget the miseries
1989353 i am happy that our athletes are participating in the olympic games i pray to god that our countrymen will win medals in their events

1989376 the issue is his bad working relationship with the players
1989377 he also treats players differently we decided were not going anywhere with him
1989378 we were used as smokescreen its not fair on the players and on zc itself because they keep being as projected as being weak and succumbing to player power
1989379 there were no major issues with robin in the players camp after all its not the players prerogative to chose who they want as coach if there were issues with robin it wouldnt be justified because weve had the same problems with the last three coaches and what has changed the common denominator here has been the players player power is not desirable in a situation as ours where we have a very weak international team
1989380 when the u s first attacked iraq i was told by my president that it was because of direct ties to al qaida and weapons of mass destruction
1989381 i made the best decision regardless of what hardships i go through i could have put iraqi families through more hardships i have no regrets
1989382 yeah if it came down to that id be willing to go to prison because i know i did the right thing and i can sleep at night and my conscience is still good
1989383 i support robin long because he is a soldier of conscience there is a huge propaganda campaign in this country to get young men to join the military he bought the hype he signed up for a promised non combat job but it turned out not to be so he decided to go to canada and follow his conscience instead
1989384 in considerably good spirits especially considering all that he is going through
1989385 aware of what he might have to face and is prepared to face it with courage and without bitterness
1989386 maybe collaboration in these muve environments is more about discussion than construction when people collaborate in world they are rarely to be found wrestling over the same polygons prims
1989387 design education consciously and deliberately strives to achieve a balance between the unrestricted and impulsive nobody the collaborative teamworking subject specific or audience satisfying anybody and the personal achievement of the author producer somebody we glued all this together with many many aha moments eureka but it is clear that individual and collective identity is bound together with the creative process
1989388 the students flicked between real world and in world chat as the games progressed
1989389 but what really tipped it for me was the lack of tools in sl for getting feedback from the audience how do i know i am being heard do i need to adjust volume where is the back channel for people to participate ask questions and so on status indicators are key

1989393 the majority of the participants were experienced philosophers they did not have to grapple with the environment and the subject once they had learnt how to text chat move and sit down an activity they all seemed to enjoy the rest was home territory
1989394 we were flexible with the teaching format and adjusted activities to fit the flow of the discussion and the speed of response from the students
1989395 the participants who signed up for the pilot self selected as those willing to investigate a possible new format this was not a mandatory part of a course in other words they were open to a new experience
1989396 second life can be deceptive on the surface it presents itself as an environment that can be interpreted by understandings from the real world it can seduce one into believing that teaching practices that work on the outside can be readily transposed inside it is a sobering experience when the particular constraints of sl kick back and even the best laid plans begin to unravel
1989397 charmed but now she picks up a sword to play everyones favorite chain mail bikini clad heroine red sonja
1989398 id been into conan since i was 12 or so
1989399 savage sword of conan was the first comic id gotten with lots of red sonja in it
1989400 i was a big fan of his since he was from texas i used to collect his books and just knew all about it so i was very surprised that she mcgowan brought that home the comic the script the offer so i told her if you want to do that it sounds like a great project to do thats like a fantasy project for someone who grew up with this
1989401 yeah i mean its good to have some kind of continuity
1989402 my favorite conan stories is probably a tie between red nails and hour of the dragon i like those and then as far as red sonja well the song of red sonja is just a great legend
1989403 yeah that one is probably something we are going to keep in the script
1989404 im committed to direct a different movie in the fall
1989405 theres 70 million dollars in funding totally there but it would have to wait a year and a half and wed have to go to germany for a long time nothing wrong with germany but its so far in advance and by then literally he could get two more movies and i could get a movie or do a tv show people just dont really understand that usually you have about 20 different things going on at once hoping one sticks if a producer or an actor or a director only had one thing they were trying to get made you would be broke in the poor house and youd be screwed
1989406 theres a scene where i am underneath a bunch of horses and im stabbing upwards

1989420 one of the things that i always find funny is when people always quote kameo and perfect dark zero as being flops at the launch of the 360 in the industry if you break even youre lucky youre in the minority
1989421 if you make a decent amount of money youre really in the minority youre in the top percentile those two games made a lot of money for the install base they sold phenomenally well
1989422 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1989423 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
1989424 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
1989425 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
1989426 in every corner of this normally dignified city you hear fragments of desperate sales pitches today only weve got eight tickets for the price of one the financial times called us decent in 2004 and overwrought comedy industry chat were pretty sure we had someone from the bbc in well it was definitely a guy with a notebook anyway
1989427 on the cusp of my ninth consecutive fringe i can confidently say its pretty much the same every year
1989428 i like to arrive into edinburgh after dark its when the festivals at its best the flyerers have scuttled away to the safety of venue bars and only the hardiest buskers survive juggling fire in the streetlight ghost tour guides wander up and down the royal mile followed by a train of punters spinning out improbable stories about grave robbers and plague streets and from almost every pub comes the sound of someone murdering a radiohead song the spiegeltent will be overpriced and overcrowded underbelly will be a catastrophic fire incident waiting to happen and the gilded balloon will be full of people trying to get into the vip bar
1989429 dan and jeff had been asked to excerpt a short piece from potted pirates wed planned sword fighting and all sorts only to discover that the stage a term i use wrongly was roughly the size of an a5 flyer they busked their way through a stand up version of a bit of the show instead as damp punters watched listlessly attempting to hear them over the woefully inadequate pa my friend the absurdly talented writer director hannah mackay accurately described the party later as being like the end of hope
1989430 a straight race between the two giant arches along the central stretch of the royal mile first past the post is the winner except no running walking only please if anyone offers you a flyer you have to turn around go back to the beginning and start again
1989431 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1989432 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1989433 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
1989434 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
1989435 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs

1989441 we love chicago more than anything and thats no lie
1989442 hot and a little anxious i always get anxious when im around this many people who are more than likely on drugs
1989443 maybe i just dont see the reason but in the court of my heart your ignorance is treason

1989445 blake is never allowed to be rsvped for events during the week because shes filming
1989446 its because there are too many people here who want to be in the square and to see the clock
1989447 the olympics will give us a beautiful stadium and maybe it will give us more professional sportsmen
1989448 i started with the plan to write a completely realistic novel about the first humans to explore mars but i couldnt get started writing it something was missing
1989449 i went out to new mexico because the arid lands of the southwest reminded me very much of the images of mars sent back by our spacecraft it was there that i realized my protagonist was part navajo a geologist whose father is pure navajo and mother a descendant of the mayflower thus was born jamie waterman mars the red world and earth the blue world symbolize the conflicts in his soul from that moment on jamies story just flowed out onto the pages
1989450 the idea that there was another intelligent race does not sit well with the ultraconservative religious groups that have taken control of the u s government
1989451 they try to shut down the mars project and jamie struggles to keep it going
1989452 ive worked very hard to stay abreast of the ongoing exploration of the red planet although i feel perfectly free to go beyond what is known today
1989453 for example no one can say that mars was not inhabited by an intelligent race millions of years ago well have to explore the planet much more thoroughly to find out if it once was
1989454 i have just devoted thirty minutes of my life to the shelling of those peas and i intend to milk them for all theyre worth

1989456 should not be considered an end to the mehdi army
1989457 we want to see whether the provisions of the agreement are serious we will be satisfied if the agreement contains the withdrawal of us forces
1989458 if so we will complete the reorganisation of the mehdi army which aims to transform it into a social organisation
1989459 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1989460 certainly there is the possibility of similar trials which americans would be very uncomfortable with when they are the defendants
1989461 the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations
1989462 this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators
1989463 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process

1989465 the csis panel is composed mostly of industry government and ex government types among the other members mary ann davidson oracles chief security officer doug maughan a homeland security program manager will pelgrin of new yorks cybersecurity office phil reitinger a microsoft security strategist and amit yoran chairman of netwitness and a former homeland security official
1989466 the commission plans to publish the final report in early november and perhaps an earlier draft for public comment
1989467 it was amazing as soon as nils saw the norwegians he moved away from all the other king penguins over to the gate and stood up to his full regal height he clearly recognised them and they all went over to greet him he was a bit upset when they left but im sure hell be very pleased next week
1989468 the details of the ceremony are being kept a closely guarded secret but the guards who visited nils were all very pleased to meet him he seemed to recognise who they were
1989469 this is a major event and the last time nils got a promotion it made headlines around the world
1989470 we are very excited to welcome the norwegian royal guard back and we are very proud of our connection with them its always a great occasion and the staff are really looking forward to it the guard came in for a quick visit today and nils olav recognised them instantly so i suspect he knows that a promotion may be imminent
1989471 the business community can influence this market if they want to
1989472 we said from the onset that this is a commitment to a long term strategy
1989473 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1989474 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1989475 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1989476 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1989477 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1989478 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
1989479 howard davies direction is so powerful it knocked me sideways so much so i wanted it to stop
1989480 its one of the best plays ive seen for a long time but with scenes so horrific i started cold sweating couldnt see and pushed away my husbands consoling touch for fear id scream
1989481 maybe the snide doctor has to detail all the gory bits
1989482 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1989483 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
1989484 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
1989485 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin

1989490 with democratic systems and large groups of people there is incredible opportunity and power and it must be approached carefully
1989491 q recent trends on digg such as the poor quality of comments and the popularity of top 10 lists seem to show that web 2 0 is failing at harnessing the smart mob effect and instead catering to the lowest common denominator what are your views on the matter
1989492 will also be able to price more competitively in the growing mobile data usage market
1989493 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
1989494 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
1989495 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1989496 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1989497 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
1989498 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
1989499 are evading the age restrictions imposed by social networking sites facebook bebo and myspace a poll of young people revealed last night
1989500 facebook myspace and bebo need to take their own age restriction policies far more seriously to help allay parents real fears
1989501 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1989502 clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination seems to be no more effective than expectant management in couples with unexplained fertility
1989503 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the uk
1989504 the data does not show that theres any difference between the drug and no treatment and iui and no treatment
1989505 the cast is already sucking due to the involvement of that hack director
1989506 in what world have you seen a car chase in a tarantino film
1989507 htcs done a wonderful job of hiding the windows mobile os on the touch diamond if it wasnt for the tiny windows logo start button in the upper left hand corner and the familiar windows mobile connection icons in the upper right hand corner most people wouldnt likely notice that the touch diamond is a windows mobile device
1989508 that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president
1989509 so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude and i want america to know that im totally ready to lead
1989510 is his age so cruelly mocked by paris hilton earlier this week
1989511 with that in mind was it really a good idea for his website to include this timeline
1989512 the timeline is matched to us history and stretches back to 1840 leading the casual reader to assume mccain is a sprightly 168 years old
1989513 ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
1989514 weve got to save something for future wolfensteins we cant do him in yet
1989515 thats one of the cool things again about the wolfenstein universe we go back and we pull some of these things from real history and spin this what if story for some of it and some of it just kind of blows out
1989516 it is probably the biggest trend in supercomputers the movement away from ivory tower research and government sponsored research to commerce and business
1989517 more than half the list reside in commercial enterprises thats a huge shift and its been under way for years
1989518 industry can no longer compete in the traditional cost and quality terms they have to look for innovation and they do that by using supercomputers so it really becomes one of the key ingredients to their innovative capacity production growth and really affects our standard of living today
1989519 almost every area of industry today is using supercomputers they use them to predict traffic patterns and many other things they are used in many ways that affect our lives in real ways
1989520 when you turn on the tv set at night and listen to the news and the weather guy tells you what the weather is going to be thats based on a supercomputer forecast using physics and mathematics high performance computers predict whats going to happen tomorrow in the next three days and the week to come
1989521 in drug discovery supercomputers simulate protein folding to determine if new drugs will couple with the proteins related to diseases and disorders
1989522 the very largest machines will still tend to be used for scientific research or other government funded applications but theres plenty of computing being applied to corporate research and even direct business applications as well
1989523 they have to do a lot of it and they have to be very fast about it because they want to finish the movie in a timely fashion
1989524 today one mega flop costs 10 cents or 1 100 for the same capacity that deep blue needed 550 000 for the technology is becoming more prevalent more ubiquitous the processors are becoming multi core and more able to do it and youve got people that have been doing this for a while and are riding this price performance curve as the price of supercomputing power comes down its interesting what even experienced users are doing with their systems
1989525 smaller supercomputers are becoming more affordable and often are owned by individual companies for their exclusive use as the cost of supercomputing declines more of these machines become available for broad use and more applications become practical for them
1989526 theyre used for all manner of simulations business analytics and product design applications even a consumer goods company like p amp g proctor amp gamble uses high performance computing extensively
1989527 p amp g used a supercomputer to do an aerodynamic simulation and now produces pringles that are aerodynamically sound and do not fly off of the assembly line
1989528 it gives us someone to hate even if that person was only responsible for a few small spam attacks a couple years ago justice is slow
1989529 that way madness lies let me shun that no more of that
1989530 the first thing is it sends a positive message that the chances of success spontaneously are pretty convincing
1989531 these treatments are cheap but common if you total all the money time and effort spent on them its considerable
1989532 it is very important that we have a strong evidence base to support the treatments that are offered to infertile couples and as such this study is very valuable
1989533 the united states shall guarantee to every state in this union a republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion and on application of the legislature or of the executive when the legislature cannot be convened against domestic violence
1989534 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1989535 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1989536 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1989537 there was a fellow with white hair out for his morning walk it happened right in front of him he just continued walking he refused to be fazed by it
1989538 can agree that the gun violence prevention debate should be based upon an open and honest exchange of ideas
1989539 city councilman jack kellys top aide his campaign treasurer and his two top political contributors pleaded not guilty to federal fraud and conspiracy charges yesterday and were released on 10 000 bail
1989540 lamented the decline in federal funding for local crime fighting programs and urged the national media and sens john mccain and barack obama to focus on urban violence
1989541 it seems theres a new and very different historic commission in town as appointed by the new mayor
1989542 breaking boyd theater unanimously voted into philly register of historic places
1989543 he played an instrumental vital part in the philadelphia rock scene
1989544 going to see this band that i had heard about called robert hazard and the heroes
1989545 and they just ripped it up they were all dressed in black with red accents it was a macho stripped down lean mean attack machine
1989546 they were playing their tight and solid new wave rock with the musicians in line behind their fearless leader and rocking the hell out of the downtown crowd
1989547 theyd move back and forth as a unit raising the energy of the crowd with each and every step it was a talented group of players and roberts songs and stage presence were not to be denied
1989548 i didnt really play guitar till much later in my teens i would audition at coffee houses like the second of autumn and the edge
1989549 i never got a job but learned about acoustic music by hanging out at these places listening to eric andersen chris smither jimmy webb and other great songwriters and poet guitar players
1989550 fought this dichotomy he was known for one thing but that was really not his essence his soul he was a folky rootsy guy
1989551 the civil rights program is a farce and a sham an effort to set up a police state
1989552 there were times when johnsons political interests coincided with the highest of americas interests the great liberal cause the cause of social justice and when they did the cause advanced
1989553 in a short period of time about 38 000 individual small business and charitable organization s will receive nearly 7 5 billion in liquidity
1989554 have been redeemed or auctioned at par value since the crisis began we remain committed to continuing our work on initiatives that will secure the best and fastest route to providing liquidity to our clients
1989555 they keep finding ways to attack the industry and that will drive innovation out of new york city and to london tokyo and elsewhere
1989556 the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor is simply a bad game it may have been better with more time and a few more eyes taking a look at the product before it shipped but its just as likely that biting all that style off better games just meant it would have been a pale imitator to begin with as the game stands now its an infuriatingly unbalanced unpolished and underwhelming experience that nobody not even fans of the movies should spend money on
1989557 hed been shot at least three times once in the back a couple times in the chest area
1989558 we believe the motive for this is robbery because supposedly the suspects demanded money from the victim
1989559 we dont know it its the suspects weapon that he dropped or if victim had a gun himself
1989560 the fundamental part of our business model is that we have a core staff of full time employees now numbering 25 which gets the extra manpower it needs to do all the production work from outside the company
1989561 that means outsourcing all the art animation sound effects music voiceover and even some of the engineering stuff on our most recent game hail to the chimp for example we had the help of 15 maybe 20 outside companies does that strategy work well for us phenomenally well
1989562 we did a bunch of due diligence on motion graphics companies that did work for cnn and 20 20
1989563 it just goes to show that some things are better left to outside experts
1989564 to me it makes no sense at all to try and hire 100 people which takes a long time
1989565 and its even harder if youre trying to hire the best of the best especially here in chicago which is a great city but isnt exactly the heart of the video games industry
1989566 most if not all of the triple a titles released have used outsourcing this is not an opinion it is a fact
1989567 i think the mainstream media is right to be cautious with this story
1989568 i think theyre good at what the national enquirer do they make sure their stories are legally airtight but i dont know if that qualifies them to be a source to follow
1989569 thats one of the reasons its news but the national enquirer owns the edwards love child story the way the washington post owned watergate
1989570 a la menor oportunidad volver is a poner esta noticia en cabecera con algo tene s que contrarrestar la avalancha de cr menes cometidos con inmigrantes exprimirla bien que igual no ten is otra hasta dentro de otros 10 meses
1989571 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
1989572 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
1989573 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks
1989574 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
1989575 since these techniques do not rely on any one specific vulnerability zovi believes that we may suddenly see many similar techniques applied to other platforms or environments
1989576 load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
1989577 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force
1989578 im sorry i only care about making money not human rights
1989579 the chinese government represses freedom of speech of religion of the press and fails to defend the independence of its judiciary and laborers rights
1989580 it also violently cracks down on tibetan demonstrators and supports authoritarian regimes in myanmar and sudan responsible for thousands of deaths
1989581 release an open letter condemning chinas human rights abuses and add human rights awareness education in childrens education services provided by ronald mcdonald house
1989582 if human rights abuses in china continue to worsen after the games mcdonalds should promise to halt sponsorship of any sports event held in china
1989583 otherwise mcdonalds is in fact endorsing repression by the chinese government
1989584 since china first cracked down on tibetan demonstration against chinese rule in march more than 200 people have died and 6 000 are missing
1989585 i cant get to sleep i think about the implications
1989586 i heard about this on van and bonnie on the radio and we all wanted to come
1989587 we didnt get a corn dog but we had a lot of fun just being here
1989588 we have more experienced guys and we have guys who understand and know what it takes to be an olympian and to be part of team usa
1989589 i never really played international basketball before 04 that was my first experience
1989590 i thought it was just going out there and just playing basketball and things would happen but the game is totally different from the way we play it
1989591 you get a different sense of respect for those guys
1989592 but at the same time i get a chance to be a cheerleader and cheer my teammates on and appreciate what we are no matter what
1989593 we have 12 superstars on this team its hard to get everyone in there in that short a period of time
1989594 if you dont feel youre going to win youve lost already
1989595 guys feel we can win you go ask spain ask argentina they feel theyre going to win thats half the battle its not about the u s being cocky or overconfident its about us being where we should be and thats already winning

1989629 i will not prophesise i will merely repeat that we are at present working discreetly but with all our might to rest this mysterious political force called sovereignty out of the clutches of the local national states of our world and all the time we are denying with our lips what we are doing with our hands because to impugn the sovereign of the local national states of the world is still heresy for which a statesman or a publicist can be perhaps not quite burnt at the stake but certainly ostracized and discredited the dragon of the local sovereign can still use its teeth and claw when it is bought to bay

1989645 we mustnt lose the will of our artists in this catastrophe their willingness to work again because the worst loss of all will be them

1989649 the most fundamental difficulties in trying to describe oil prices lie in the operational definition of a bubble
1989650 there is no consensus one standard definition is exponential growth of price but exponential growth of price is normal in economics because it just corresponds to a constant growth rate our definition is faster than exponential growth of the price which is necessarily unsustainable
1989651 i expect rather soon some calming with a correction of the price
1989652 but it seems that for the medium term one has to be bullish on oil

1989654 the slow adoption of vista among businesses and budget conscious chief information officers coupled with the proven success of a new type of microsoft free pc in every region provides an extraordinary window of opportunity for linux
1989655 i also hate the use of the business to mean an opposing force that only exists to complicate the world of it
1989656 ive hated the phrase the business since my first day as a trainee because i thought i had joined my company to be part of the business not some spotty little sibling that the big kids are embarrassed to be seen with

1989664 the naval component of the joint task force operation flush out 111 on wednesday 6 august encountered a group of militants along cawthorne channel port harcourt the militants who were moving in three speed boats opened fire on sighting the naval men who were on routine patrol the naval gunboats in self defense engaged the militants in gun battle which left some militants dead two militants boats were destroyed in the process also a large boat one general purpose machine gun with large amount of ammunition and one live grenade were recovered from the hoodlums
1989665 the eastern naval command on its part is improving on the number of available platforms for patrols which has resulted in better presence at sea
1989666 eat this thing which i was sweet and seemed to be delicious
1989667 cultural issues aside it will be an important test not just for whether one can deliver legal online music in china
1989668 as important to me as the piracy question is whether google can create a useful and compelling revenue stream off an ad supported service like this
1989669 if you think about what they could learn in terms of all the data traffic patterns and seeing how people in china find music online it will have long term implications
1989670 maybe what youll see is if chinese users find this alternative where the selection is broad and its convenient people might be willing to monetize that through their attention to online ads or direct payment for music over time
1989671 the music labels have been to a large degree eviscerated in terms of their traditional revenue model for the past several years
1989672 the labels have got to be thinking boy why shouldnt we

1989682 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
1989683 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
1989684 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
1989685 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
1989686 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
1989687 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
1989688 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
1989689 obesity is very common in the united states so this potentially affects a lot of people
1989690 we cant forget that when we use the term obese we are not just talking about very very large men a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese
1989691 its difficult to single out japan for this as it happens all over the world but there is an alarmingly high number of cases in japan
1989692 it was almost like being in oklahoma or the ozarks
1989693 had to move the cars to higher ground or theyd be floating
1989694 weve got three drains out there in that parking lot and i was up to my chest in water
1989695 the worst was in 2001 there was about four feet of water outside the store and about three feet inside
1989696 the force of the water in the system stripped the bolts and blew the lid off
1989697 i shouldnt have to mop up in my store every time it rains
1989698 but theyve got priorities and sometimes theyre not here where we live
1989699 just like condoms or faulty medical supplies bad laws can spread the virus
1989700 one doesnt know whether its holding hands kissing fondling or anything more extensive
1989701 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment
1989702 these results challenge current practice as endorsed by a national guideline in the u k
1989703 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
1989704 we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
1989705 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
1989706 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
1989707 people wont vote for you unless theres a great deal of comfort with who you are
1989708 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv
1989709 the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
1989710 we thought he was just talking when he made the threats against our father
1989711 with the rise of terror incidents in the country our security forces need better equipment and technology as the nation fights terrorism and crime
1989712 our rural areas are engaged in the task of feeding the nation and we must not forget that we survive because of our farmers however our farmers are affected by floods drought pests lack of infrastructure and low yields as compared to the rest of the world
1989713 while many of these areas are specialized iit engineers have a duty to the nation to produce cutting edge solutions for our rural areas
1989714 i talked to him on wednesday night and he said we were fine we were great and were a go then i get a call from his agent who says tony has flipped and hes staying with agr
1989715 in the next couple days the transcripts will be coming out
1989716 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus
1989717 said robert hansen also known as rsnake a founder of security consultancy sectheory
1989718 in the last four weeks there have been 13 call outs and quite sure why that is
1989719 its quite bizarre never in 40 years have we had this many
1989720 but theres no obvious thing thats happening more were being called out to anything like the incident on wednesday to things like engine failure so no one thing can be to blame
1989721 its not really for us to comment on because a rescue is a rescue and theres no different way to treat it
1989722 certainly it has been a busy time for us and we do receive a lot of calls from cramond island
1989723 the times of the tide are clearly marked and our number is there perhaps people just go across and lose track of time
1989724 we would say that drinking and sailing are definitely a no go not only because it inhibits decision making and reaction time but because if youre underwater you go down a lot quicker with alcohol inside you
1989725 he was mad at us because we made him do his own laundry
1989726 i just want to make sure this clown doesnt get out
1989727 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1989728 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
1989729 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
1989730 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
1989731 liberate iraq support our troops lawn sign campaign in 2003 is at it again
1989732 i think one important fact here is that no taxpayer went to fund that 5 million
1989733 there wasnt enough insurance coverage and theres no amount of money that can compensate mrs barnes and her family for the loss of judge barnes life
1989734 we recognized judge barnes sterling reputation and our own affection for him and for his widow when considering our fees
1989735 i didnt think it was fair to judge mather and the county to stay on during the trial
1989736 but i do think claudia barnes had an exceptionally strong case
1989737 there are issues of whether workmans compensation is an exclusive remedy and of qualified immunity
1989738 the settlement just shows how the defendants view their liability in these cases
1989739 i believe we will prove our cases at trial and get a substantial award for our clients
1989740 looks like the voters have had enough of sheriff freeman as well
1989741 fulton county has been turning its back on these victims for three years
1989742 so its nice to see it start paying some attention to them for a change
1989743 the general public unceremoniously kicked the sheriff out of office and theres a reason for that
1989744 when one case settles that can give the other attorneys and plaintiffs an idea of the value of the other cases
1989745 the best strategy to me is to continue to prepare for trial and be ready to go to trial
1989746 when that is done in a professional and competent way it puts the plaintiff in the best possible position even in the event that there is a settlement offer if not youre in the best position for trial
1989747 as a lawyer and somebody who knew and cared about rowland barnes and who knows claudia i am happy to hear that this chapter of that sad story is coming to a close
1989748 were negligent in the most basic and ministerial of their responsibilities
1989749 georgia law requires the sheriff or his or her designee to attend sessions of court
1989750 undoubtedly the purpose of this statutory requirement is to afford a minimum of courtroom security this basic obligation was breached over and above the obligation imposed by aware of the extreme risk of violence posed by mr nichols but took absolutely no action to guard against it
1989751 the stylish horizontal slider of the samsung messager is easy to use the samsung messagers attractive layout and qwerty keyboard is a great fit for people who love text messaging
1989752 we and the union leadership have been making consistent progress and have resolved most of the important issues
1989753 verizon is committed to continue negotiating as long as it takes to complete the process
1989754 a pol cia esteve todas aquelas horas espera para este triste fim
1989755 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
1989756 just the beginning of apples exploration of multi touch on the mac
1989757 ps your captcha utility at the bottom here is verging on farcical i cant distinguish some of the words let alone a spambot for example what in the bloody hell is an inkjopskontor and a mille
1989758 the backend has been committed to the main mozilla source code and is enabled by default this original commit is a work in progress there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
1989759 in recognition of the incarceration and suffering of budapest holocaust survivors certain jewish survivors of nazi era budapest who currently reside in eastern europe and previously did not receive any payments from certain major compensation program will receive a one time payment of 1 900 euros from the claims conference budapest fund
1989760 these payments mean a historical recognition of the horrible fate of the budapest jewry during the nazi persecution
1989761 streamline the process and distribute the funds as quickly as possible the claims conference has reviewed over 25 000 files to identify eligible survivors
1989762 okay double the diameter and there is 4 times the surface area and also four times the material cost and weight and resistance it would make sense therefore that the power output should be x4
1989763 more energy goes into their production shipping and maintenance than is saved by their use
1989764 if 10 of households installed turbines at costs of energy below 12p kwh indicative of the current retail electricity price up to 1 5 twh could be generated and 0 6 mtco2 saved
1989765 small scale wind energy has the potential to generate 41 3 twh of electricity and abate 17 8 mtco2 in the uk annually
1989766 the primary driver of lifecycle carbon for small wind turbines is the amount of electricity generated it appears that in many potential urban installation situations roof mounted turbines may not pay back the carbon emitted during their production installation and operation
1989767 how the do you save 600 000 tons of carbon dioxide and be a
1989768 there is also an opportunity cost to be considered the production energy money could have been used in make fewer but larger turbines to be placed in a location where they will achieve the greatest efficiency doing little things to help the environment can take away time from doing big things to help the environment
1989769 destruction of vast habitats for a wind farm is not helping the environment
1989770 they are talking about the carbon footprint the production of the turbines causes compared to a greater efficiency of larger units
1989771 lying our asses off and raking in record profits at the expense of our own consumers for 100 years
1989772 if you dont have wind dont use wind turbines as a primary source
1989773 im not sure where that balance point is or whether or not we have reached it yet but we need to acknowledge its existence
1989774 most studies have found life cycle emissions of nuclear to be comparable with renewables
1989775 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
1989776 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
1989777 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
1989778 theyre both very nice good hearted people leo is the jokester and robert is more reserved hes more the gentleman
1989779 the one thing that theyre looking for is larger accounts that they can clean out
1989780 they havent automated the money transfer part of the process so theyre looking for the biggest accounts to get the most money the quickest
1989781 and thats a conservative estimate of what they could get
1989782 this was only a fraction of the accounts they had stolen
1989783 the fact that theyve been in operation for over six years shows theres not a whole lot of risk to them
1989784 but we need a lot more effort and cooperation to do anything about this
1989785 there is no question that african americans are disproportionately represented among the ranks of those with hiv and aids
1989786 paints a portrait of what black america would look like if it were a separate country
1989787 some worry that not enough money is being spent at home
1989788 an integrated approach to preventing hiv and sexually transmitted infections is needed in communities of color particularly women who engage in sex with heterosexual male partners
1989789 federal policy continues to exclude the role of heterosexual men in the transmission of hiv infection and stis to women
1989790 the need for increased prevention services for women especially women of color has been clearly demonstrated and documented
1989791 most policies and services at the federal state and local levels have been crafted primarily for men
1989792 about 95 per cent of text messages on bells network are sent and received by clients on text bundles anyone who plans to send and receive a significant number of text messages really should be on a plan
1989793 with a view to finding a solution that provides the best service to consumers at the best price
1989794 clearly mr prentice is not on the side of the ordinary canadian who is wondering why these companies are being allowed to get away with gouging
1989795 it looks as though they are listening to the boardroom table more than the kitchen table where people sit down to pay the bills
1989796 that being said our products and services are excellent and we are very optimistic about the direction were heading
1989797 i pay my taxes why should i be told what to do
1989798 its working because im not having to go down the police station with andrew spending four or five hours at a time
1989799 youre punishing the majority of children who behave for the crimes of a few and potentially those causing the trouble arent even under 16
1989800 if a few adults broke the law you wouldnt impose a curfew on every adult in the community
1989801 we have to think to ourselves when are the midges going to be active and what can we do to put a barrier between our livestock and these midges
1989802 we will use our models to advise on best practice for measures such as stabling insecticide use and vaccination to control the spread of the bluetongue virus
1989803 the benefit of these techniques is that until very recently midge surveillance relied upon the use of light traps that sometimes did not represent what was happening on the animals very well
1989804 using these two techniques we can more easily understand the relationship between weather conditions and both background midge activity and biting attacks
1989805 ladbrokes for example used the code to give mobile users access to its free bet promotion
1989806 die sind von einer flasche aus dem siebzehnten oder achtzehnten jahrhundert

1989809 apple needs to do a lot of work to improve communications between developers and the people in charge of the app store
1989810 in my experience communication has been pretty spotty so far as opposed to the great service apples provided with developer technical support we have questions that have gone unanswered so far and unlike dts we dont even have any kind of direct contact with anyone there unfortunately
1989811 netshare did not violate any of the developer or app store agreements
1989812 automated email systems being employed on both ends which resulted in emails being lost in transit
1989813 its like the app store division is this top secret untouchable branch of apple
1989814 apple pulled the app july 31 without giving my any notification that they were doing it or what their justification was for removing it
1989815 ive tried to contact them about the issue but its been a complete dead end
1989816 clear consistent communication and a application standard policy that is clear and applied universally to all developers
1989817 communication is the key here both between apple and devs and also among devs themselves
1989818 the iphone sdk nda has been completely hindering progress and it needs to be lifted asap
1989819 if apple wants to keep things in upcoming versions of the sdk under wraps then it should be possible to modify the nda so that were all able to communicate about things that are in the final shipping version of the iphone os and sdk once this happens iphone development in general will improve because well be able to discuss issues openly and share code publicly the iphone platform as a whole will undoubtedly improve as a result
1989820 if this is not war then i wonder what is
1989821 as a result of the hours long shelling of tskhinvali by heavy weaponry the city is almost totally destroyed
1989822 we cannot allow the deaths of our countrymen to go unpunished the guilty parties will receive the punishment they deserve
1989823 they have in effect begun hostilities using tanks and artillery
1989824 we have lost control over some parts of the city
1989825 we are a freedom loving nation right now under attack
1989826 ambulances cannot move hospitals are reported to be overflowing surgery is taking place in corridors
1989827 this morning a unhcr staff member reported that many buildings and houses have been destroyed and that only military personnel are moving on the streets
1989828 water is also in short supply a chronic problem worsened by recent events most transport has stopped and shops are running out of food
1989829 were not saying karma will catch up to you and ruin your life if you unsubscribe by clicking here but dont come crying to us when it does
1989830 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
1989831 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
1989832 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
1989833 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
1989834 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
1989835 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
1989836 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
1989837 im here for one reason not to do commercials broadway all those things
1989838 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
1989839 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
1989840 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
1989841 what do you get when you combine images from google earth and the brainpower from researchers at oak ridge national labs well in this case you get
1989842 major power outages in the united states over the past decade have a recurring theme the lack of wide area situational understanding
1989843 youre just the sort of person i imagined marrying when i was little except yknow not green and without all the patches of fungus

1989846 id still love to see the regular lineup of utley burrell howard
1989847 all we get from everyone that has spoken about him is that they will never meet anyone like him
1989848 he was a lovely lad who was always there if anyone needed him he would do anything for anyone
1989849 its bad enough if its one of your parents but when you lose one of your children its just awful
1989850 he had an operation earlier in the year in february and everything seemed to be ok he seemed to be doing well
1989851 then he went out to west lothian to meet up with a few lads for a game of poker he said he wasnt feeling too good and then he passed away just like that
1989852 at times it still doesnt seem real we know its not a dream and that were going to wake up and everything will be fine but i dont think it has hit us yet
1989853 we are a pretty close family weve always been close he has aunts and uncles in north america and they were just devastated when they were told
1989854 his sons mark and andrew have been run off their feet doing everything that needs to be done and of course looking after us
1989855 the phillies are mlbs homeless sifting through the garbage to find unwanted trash
1989856 hes not walking anyone or allowing home runs he also has a very strong groundball rate
1989857 i dont understand how continually building your team isnt a better strategy than just pulling a yankee
1989858 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
1989859 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
1989860 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
1989861 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
1989862 i personally oppose the presidents power to sack the parliament and the government and believe it should be scrapped but i also oppose the presidents impeachment
1989863 made a hasty decision and they will be trapped in their own game
1989864 we are going to oppose it it is a half baked effort
1989865 the coalition believes it is imperative to move for impeachment against gen musharraf
1989866 what theyre going to try is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
1989867 playing the race card from the bottom of the deck
1989868 slimy foul poisonous designed to exploit the hostility anxiety and resentment of the many white americans who are still freakishly hung up on the idea of black men rising above their station and becoming sexually involved with white women
1989869 itll probably take a month before everything is checked and we know for sure
1989870 next up before the military commissions bin ladens pastry chef for providing culinary support to terrorism
1989871 there is very little precedent for this kind of trial because historically pirates brigands partisans guerillas and other unlawful combatants had not right to trial and were not generally granted trials unless the capturing country wanted to make a public example out of them
1989872 whenever feasible martial law is carried out in cases of individual offenders by military courts but sentences of death shall be executed only with the approval of the chief executive provided the urgency of the case does not require a speedier execution and then only with the approval of the chief commander
1989873 all wanton violence committed against persons in the invaded country all destruction of property not commanded by the authorized officer all robbery all pillage or sacking even after taking a place by main force all rape wounding maiming or killing of such inhabitants are prohibited under the penalty of death or such other severe punishment as may seem adequate for the gravity of the offense
1989874 a soldier officer or private in the act of committing such violence and disobeying a superior ordering him to abstain from it may be lawfully killed on the spot by such superior
1989875 how will you stand out in the crowd and get the scoop no one else can
1989876 i love politics i love news and i love watching politics on the news
1989877 i have the political knowledge to know what questions to ask the tenacity to get out there and ask them and i am ready to have a lot of fun doing it

1989881 you know who is in charge now the gestapo agents at homeland security they are in charge
1989882 aside from being demeaning to the law enforcement officers that uphold the very laws passed by mr gutierrezs congress its potentially dangerous no member of congress should be encouraging the public to defy or demean federal law enforcement officers words matter
1989883 what happens is the public image of you becomes one of not this compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a gestapo type agency that is knocking on doors

1989915 the scene that was shot this week is set in times square around 1974 when mr durst visited the luxor hotel in 1977 there were nearly 100 sex related businesses in the area in 1987 there were 35 now these kinds of businesses are scattered and mostly pushed to the eighth avenue border

1989920 no nose saddles are a useful intervention for bicycling police officers alleviating pressure to the groin and improving penis health different saddle designs may require some re learning of how to ride a bicycle but the health benefits to having unrestricted vascular flow to and from the penis and less penile numbness is self evident
1989921 the a b cs of the journal of sexual medicine awareness bicycle seats and choices
1989922 for the first time we have a prospective study of healthy policemen riding bikes on the job using wider no nose bike saddles for 6 months not only did their sensation improve their erectile function also improved changing saddles changed physiology this is a landmark study for our field that that is important for future riders and modification of lifestyle showing improvement without any active treatment
