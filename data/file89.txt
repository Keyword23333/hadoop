890000 to establish a system of criminal laws the legislature must make certain moral choices defining what behavior is right and what behavior is wrong absent a constitutional prohibition those decisions may and should express the moral judgment of the majority
890001 sexual behavior does not fall outside this principle simply because it is intimate and private in nature
890002 only recently has the supreme court gradually increased its own authority from griswold v connecticut which struck down laws prohibiting the sale of birth control devices to planned parenthood v casey which struck down several pennsylvania anti abortion statutes to lawrence at the expense of the peoples authority
890003 and although the court sought to cabin its authority in glucksberg that decision still assumes that the court has the authority to look outside the written constitution to establish unenumerated substantive due process rights
890004 accepting this premise is to accept as constitutionally legitimate a constitutionally enigmatic jurisprudence without constitutional limits reliable is a perfect illustration
890005 the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
890006 we must not forget however that the liberty we safeguard belongs not to us but to the people by using the fourteenth amendment as a vehicle for creating unenumerated substantive due process rights the court abrogates the peoples right to establish the contours of their basic liberties and arrogates that power to itself
890007 the peoples right to establish the contours of their basic liberties
890008 the vote will be at least 6 3 because even some of the liberals on the court i particularly have in mind justice breyer and moderate conservative justice kennedy will think that the courts power to recognize unenumerated rights should be saved for rights e g abortion contraception sexual intimacy parental rights right to refuse medical treatment right to live with close family members and the like that are more important in most of their exercisers lives
890009 so lucky to be off on this grand adventure all by yourself
890010 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 per cent or so still is very useful for us
890011 we understand they are disappointed because they had been awaiting for the approval but did not obtain it within the time of period they expected
890012 but china oriental and arcelormittal have so far never talked about giving up raising the stake
890013 i think deans has got no choice now hes got to throw him in there
890014 weve got one of the best lineout exponents in the world in dan vickerman hes been injured and came on as a replacement but weve got to obviously shore that up because the south africans are fairly good in the lineout with victor matfield so weve got to get our basics right
890015 it will be tough and im not saying they can do it but theyve got probably more chance of defeating the springboks than the wallabies
890016 itll be a horror trip for the wallabies theres no doubt about it
890017 just going on past history as much as were bad in new zealand were probably worse in south africa
890018 i think burgess came on to the scene with a great hullabaloo i think hes played reasonably well i think hes probably a little bit off the pace at the moment
890019 hes only a young guy and i guess like everybody when the forwards are doing well you look okay
890020 but what we want our players to do is under pressure theyve got to rise to the occasion and i think luke burgess was probably missing a little bit and it probably reflected on the way matt played
890021 this investigation shows that about 57 vertical steel bars may have been cut when the gantry was attached to the bridge well within the number allowed for under the strict safety controls in place and a small fraction of the 21 000 vertical bars inside the bridge
890022 the safety of the bridge was never in question and i am pleased this investigation has confirmed that
890023 he confessed that he committed the crime because he had copied it from the game he played
890024 he wanted money to play the game his parents who work as civil servants did not have enough money to give him

890028 his statement in a foreign financial newspaper recently that he would take over the government on sept 16 has caused irreparable damage to the countrys economy
890029 it caused many potential foreign investors who were planning to set up their businesses in malaysia to review their plans this shows that anwar doesnt care and will do whatever it takes to become the prime minister
890030 anwar has now shown his true colours he is a man who cannot be trusted and i hope the malays will fight him by rejecting him in the coming by election in permatang pauh
890031 the focus on party polls resulted in members not looking enough into the broader interest of the community
890032 it is no doubt making people very uncomfortable when at the same time there is an increase in fuel prices people are worried but so much money is circulating in certain parts of the country
890033 pakatan rakyat is definitely doing a better job at the moment but it is giving pressure to barisan to improve its game if pakatan rakyat disappears there will be no one to push barisan to reform

890100 cant we just celebrate the fact that we dont have only one system and that there is a choice
890101 will you be lining up for an iphone air vista xbox when its released
890102 i am the cause of that for which i winge about i reap what i sow
890103 i set up my sisters mac on a shitty router and it didnt work so macs suxxxors
890104 i just bought my first computer with vista and the games are teh orrsom better than mac
890105 on the other side of the coin people want to be creative and use the best available usually this is a mac
890106 its just a pc with a shiny silver finish and a different operating system
890107 cant we just celebrate the fact that we dont have only one system and that there is a choice
890108 oh your right we are sooo sick of the debate but my mac is sooo much better
890109 i dont feel safe when i leave my comfort zone so i am lashing out
890110 as far as i see when apple released bootcamp it killed the pc side of things the market statistics are a good example of that
890111 i can also now run windows and mac os on the same machine if i want to wherever and whenever i want the best part is if you have parallels most files are cross compatable
890112 now i have a question for you hardware or software if your talking about hardware then apple has already won because you can run most oss and im sorry to say are far more advanced
890113 yeah well we have 98 of the global market b tch
890114 how come when i copy a file from os x onto xp i get a special mac bonus called a ds file what rubbish is that
890115 i dont like phillips drivers i only use the flats
890116 ive used macs for 5 years now and i cant believe more people havent made the switch yet nothing apple says about their products is untrue they work theyre beautifully designed and they last the distance theyre more than a tool by which to get a job done its the same reason why people drive audis and vws rather than the latest cut price offering from korea or malaysia they cost more well in apples case not that much more these days but they are simply better
890117 its the same reason why people drive audis and vws rather than the latest cut price offering from korea or malaysia
890118 i did buy myself one of their flower power imacs as i dabbled once in graphic design as a hobby at the time it cost me a small fortune but it was cute in retrospect i could get two really good pcs for that price
890119 holy shit that must be why when i bought one that the sound card was dead on arrival that didnt work did it
890120 hahahahahahaha this is the best people drive audis and vws either because they are rich or suckers or both sure audi makes some great cars as does vw but why dont you take a trip over to germany and see how much your prestige vehicles fetch over there
890121 ah i think yr missing the point the idea is not to jam the product into every corner or overwhelm the customer with sell sell sell that would be what a dell store would look like
890122 their original claims were computers for everyone and the power to be your best when you buy apple you are signing up for usability focused design
890123 their original claims were computers for everyone and the power to be your best when you buy apple you are signing up for usability focused design
890124 there are two types of people in the world those who who love their macs and those who dont know what they are missing
890125 its the same reason why people drive audis and vws rather than the latest cut price offering from korea or malaysia they cost more well in apples case not that much more these days but they are simply better
890126 you might be able to buy two cheap pcs for the price of a new mac but not two pcs that are equivalent to the macs specs please note dvi outputs on all the laptops etc when you start comparing new macs are priced pretty well
890127 jood one button mouse easily fixed buy an aftermarket 2 button mouse it works in almost exactly the same fashion
890128 if you look closely at vista it is little else but a poor copy of osx designed in such a way that it looks remarkably similar i cant believe there was no lawsuite over widgets vs gadgets
890129 i have used mac and pcs extensively and the mac wins hands down for build quality overall and usability stability by a large margin
890130 ah that must have been your pc you are whinging about macs dont have
890131 no electric product is faultless but ive had less problems with apple products than pc products
890132 i hat teh maks and teh maks r suxxors bcoz i have teh pc and it gots teh wow on it nd i can have teh mouse witeh 2 buttnzorz 11
890133 i am a graphic artist and in the last 10 years ive probably worked about 40 of the time on mac i can honestly say that the only time i prefer it is when i am on an hourly rate because it always takes a lot longer to finish anything nothing could ever tempt me to buy one mainly because i woudl be restricted to using the msot expensive and often less than ideal applications for my work being on a pc gives me so much more choice and allows me to use the right tool for each job
890134 pc gives you so much more choice and allows you to use the right tool for each job

890136 its all just hardware over the next few years linux with own you all the latest versions of linux are as usable as mac os and windows if adobe released their suite on linux i would use it exclusively posted by sam on june 10 2008 11 25 am
890137 it is a retail space designed to get the consumer in sell product and make profit by any definition it is just another consumer electronics store to say otherwise is to have fallen under the spell of the myth that is apple the underdog apple is a huge multinational company just like microsoft just like exxon and just like all the rest
890138 yes i remember when windows 95 was launched now that was a marketing coup mac users were stunned that people thought windows 95 was a big leap forward it might have been for pcs but it was old news for us wed had a graphic user interface since 1987 ie for eight years
890139 i have been to the apple store in new york a few times and they all but ignore you like youre not hip enough to be in their store
890140 i can remember a full on pc guy having a bet that apple would go bust within a year
890141 dont forget that apple charge you for their os service packs microsoft do not
890142 no one in the music industry uses a pc no one in the movie industry uses a pc
890143 this is going to be really really hard to use
890144 add to that that many games do not run on macs essential for children the amount of freeware amp shareware is a lot more limited
890145 macs are for people that dont really get computers are afraid of making decisions and confuse easily therefore the opinions of mac users about computers in general do not count
890146 computers for people that cant figure out how to set up and run a pc
890147 and to think apple has only been in the retail business for seven years
890148 i havent had a core meltdown a virus spam a freeze or problem since i bought my mac two years ago
890149 just how openly biased the herald writers are towards mac

890152 todays ruling is about an attempt by lvmh to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law abiding sellers that ebay empowers everyday
890153 we will make our best effort to recover the funds in question if they become available in the sellers account in the future and will take appropriate action against the seller such action may include issuing a warning a temporary restriction or terminating the account
890154 paypal add 2 5 to final price for cost recovery
890155 if enforcing a preferred payment method onto sellers could be shown to have the effect of substantially lessening competition by effectively substantially excluding other options that would come under the reach of section 47 they could still face action anyway conceivably from other parties seeking an injunction if they could show that the part one changes substantially lessened competition
890156 but you would think that would be a difficult task difficult but possible if these other things are happening as well that discourage other payment options
890157 the first part of the project doesnt force sellers or buyers to use paypal only
890158 simon has been slightly misquoted in the sheet in last fridays edition and on the boards as saying he was pleased the accc had accepted the may 21 changes

890160 we have decided in your favour however we were unable to recover any funds from the sellers account

890165 any buyer wishing to use pay pal as their payment method must pay the extra fees charged to the seller
890166 third line forcing is a specific form of exclusive dealing prohibited outright by the trade practices act it is not subject to the substantial lessening of competition test it involves the supply of goods or services on condition that the purchaser buys goods or services from a particular third party or a refusal to supply because the purchaser will not agree to that condition
890167 ebay australias chief executive simon smith said the company was pleased the accc accepted one part of the project the requirement for all ebay sellers to offer paypal as a payment option
890168 the evidence available does not support the view that paypal is the most secure method of payment or offers the best service for all transactions
890169 third line forcing is a specific form of exclusive dealing prohibited outright by the trade practices act it is not subject to the substantial lessening of competition test it involves the supply of goods or services on condition that the purchaser buys goods or services from a particular third party or a refusal to supply because the purchaser will not agree to that condition

890174 in general i totally acknowledge the fact that ebays new policy really stinks for local pickup items i wish i had a great response but i dont if you want to sell local pickup please keep in mind that theres no way to be protected from chargebacks
890175 todays ruling is about an attempt by lvmh to protect their own commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law abiding sellers that sell on ebay every day
890176 todays decisions are not about fighting counterfeiting its about lvmhs desire to protect commercial practices that exclude all competition

890235 since hitting a peak in the summer of 2007 the illegal population may have declined by 11 percent through may of 2008
890236 it seems that increased enforcement is at least partly responsible for this decline
890237 the census bureau does not produce estimates or counts of illegal immigrants living in the united states
890238 the persuasiveness of cis argument is undermined not only by an absence of hard data but by the faulty logic and contradictory statements of the report itself
890239 the authors report confidently about a population that is nearly impossible to accurately measure
890240 undocumented migration clearly responds to changing u s economic conditions with steep increases in the flow toward the end of expansion phases of the business cycle and significant decreases during economic downturns
890241 there is no evidence of an exodus either because of economic conditions or greater enforcement
890242 several demographers who specialize in estimating the illegal immigrant population expressed concern about the limits of the studys methodology but said they found the possibility that the illegal immigrant population is decreasing plausible determining the actual amount of that decline however is a far more controversial matter
890243 that does not support the argument that people are leaving but rather that people here are spending less money because of economic conditions and future plans
890244 while it is clear that a large share of illegal aliens are included in census bureau surveys there is always the question of those who are missed although dhs as well as most researchers assume a 10 percent undercount there is debate about the number of illegal immigrants who are not counted
890245 the center for immigration studies cis has a history of misrepresenting facts concerning immigrants and latinos
890246 this is a very painful failure and a real setback for the global economy when we really needed some good news

890248 opening of markets removal of tariffs and withdrawal of state intervention in agriculture has turned developing countries from net food exporters to net food importers and burdened them with huge import bills

890268 we did 2 3 million in sales last year and we pay a lot of taxes here
890269 a couple of months ago a guy from china came here to buy property because its cheap and he spent 160 000 cash for a three bedroom two bath home in the south area to rent out
890270 and told me about all these brand names i dont even know of
890271 because of the olympics the chinese economy and political change it makes people pay attention
890272 as a business you have to be aware of your competition and without a presence in china youre kind of left behind

890283 not only did we lose our dad our mom is dead to us

890285 death row inmates are the absolute worst people in our society
890286 these web sites are an affront to victims of tragedy the families who have been impacted by the over 600 people on death row
890287 there have been many cases of people on death row who are really innocent
890288 it would be a huge mistake for those people not to have the right to communicate with the outside world
890289 its not like they are given a laptop and wireless and told to go to it
890290 i dont mean to sound callous but my suggestion is to not look

890292 i started to lose touch with reality and my work suffered
890293 i lost my girl my house my mind and all but 40 000 or so of my savings i finally went off the deep end completely and wound up on death row killed 2 people for insane reasons
890294 my remaining immediate family members reside outside the united states and i am currently the only chinese prisoner on californias death row at san quentin prison because of these and other reasons i constantly feel misplaced sad and lonely like a dolphin caught inside a tuna net
890295 laci and i enjoyed supporting education i believe that we both volunteered at elementary schools during our high school years later we were lucky enough to do some things for our college alma mater we could have we should have done more

890297 whats going to bring voters out this fall is the contest for president people are extremely concerned with the economy and the rising price of food and gas
890298 he gets the troops fired up and ready to go
890299 i obviously am very grateful for all the work kevin has done on the obama campaign and i do tend to lean towards kevin because mayor fargo came out and supported hillary clinton
890300 the mood of the country is desiring change and i think its difficult for a 20 year incumbent to claim that shes an agent of change
890301 my opinion is the obama voters will overwhelmingly support kevin because theyre change voters
890302 weve already had conversations with the democratic party about the ways were going to coordinate with them
890303 on many levels the members of the central committee feel shes the real democrat
890304 hes getting an enormous amount of his support from republicans
890305 the presidential candidates are always the hook thats the sexy part
890306 were going to use our support of obama as an entree to phone calls and neighborhood visits we have an obligation as the democratic party of sacramento county to help with down ticket candidates that would include the mayor were going to be including our recommendation for heather in most of the activities well be doing

890322 it has been more difficult to find borrowers than we thought
890323 we are going to walk our talk with financial support for local small scale agriculture
890324 it seems like these days everyone has a television show to pitch
890325 the idea of pitching is like the american dream its living on your wits and based on a good idea you can make your fortune
890326 is every episode a one off or is there a serial aspect to the show
890327 the aliens are abducting people and sucking them into their television content there will be disembodied heads and eventually the viewers will recognize the heads
890328 but does someone end up with an agent or a production deal or just make some good contacts yes
890329 the value is not only for the person pitching but for the industry too they come here for free because they could spot that diamond in the rough
890330 the show combines the quick wit of laugh in with the edge of the dave chappell show it would be part the apprentice with tv writers competing within a tv writers room and part sketch comedy
890331 i have to be honest with you they offered me store manager
890332 but i knew that if i picked up a store that would be it for me i have to follow my passion this is the rest of my life that im talking about

890337 we were fundamentally missing an opportunity in terms of getting tinker bell out there as a character
890338 they brought with them an illustration that had been used when they were working on the animated bambi it was a beautiful illustration of a dove
890339 the only thing she says in barrie is silly ass thats her line and she tries to have wendy killed a couple of times
890340 but she also saves peter she drinks the poison to keep peter from drinking it i built on that on her love for peter her loyalty her courage she is not in my mind a warm fuzzy character
890341 were making loans like we did 15 years ago you get to look at what people make and they make a real down payment
890342 we thought housing prices had gotten a little out of control
890343 everyone was in such a frenzy of doing stranger and more exotic loans that we just felt it was time to back away
890344 firstfed is not currently in any danger of being taken over by the fdic nor do we foresee any scenario that could even put us in that position
890345 you get to look at what people make and they make a real down payment
890346 appears to be aggressively addressing problem loans and modifying option arm loans that have payment resets
890347 im not concerned about making money on every trip since doing the right thing will even everything out in the end
890348 gas prices are killing us and we cant get the difference out of our customers
890349 if a customer represented 10 of your business hes now 8

890357 my friend rick brought me lunch and i stayed until closing then i arrived saturday morning at 11 minutes after six
890358 a glimmer of hope is that weve moderated some of those input costs
890359 i think every fed official would be likely to conclude that inflation pressures would be in danger of rebounding if the economy started to come back
890360 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
890361 was intended by our founders to be interpreted in the light of the constantly evolving experience of the american people
890362 guard with jealous attention the public liberty suspect everyone who approaches that jewel unfortunately nothing will preserve it but downright force whenever you give up that force you are ruined the great object is that every man be armed everyone who is able may have a gun
890363 i ask you sir who are the militia they consist now of the whole people
890364 a well regulated militia composed of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country
890365 no freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms
890366 who are the militia are they not ourselves is it feared then that we shall turn our arms each man against his own bosom congress have no power to disarm the militia their swords and every other terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of an american the unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments but where i trust in god it will ever remain in the hands of the people

890370 im a man driven by passion but i am really not doing much
890371 im simply riding a bike going to a couple of places and working for a day
890372 she probably e mailed about 6 100 times and i answered each one back personally
890373 she always said that if i was near galveston i should come by
890374 after meeting me you cant go back and think everybody is a piece of expletive
890375 as a black man i know that black men need to see you dont have to be bad to distinguish yourself
890376 they say being a cop is a ticket to the best show on earth and it really is
890377 you see the most bizarre things you see the funniest things you see the saddest things you see the happiest things the whole roller coaster that cop stuff really saved my life made me feel alive
890378 being a cop satisfied my need to see if theres something else out there for me that i love more than basketball
890379 you get out of bed and say i cant wait to get to work i always do that as a basketball coach
890380 it wasnt the ideal situation but i was thinking of sue more than anything else
890381 you can put her in any position and she has experience and knows what to do and whats expected
890382 i personally wouldnt have had enough energy to get on a plane
890383 supposedly when you get five years away from the cancer youre good
890384 i just want to get as far away from it as i can every year is a good year
890385 we didnt have much of a team but when sue came that changed things for us
890386 we basically had one play in school bring the ball down and get it to sue
890387 but i just wanted to get away from it because thats all i had been doing
890388 she is totally different from that stereotype she always has an awesome personality the fact shes succeeded doesnt surprise anybody because shes always so upbeat
890389 there were a lot of connections between being a cop and being a basketball coach or a team member on a basketball team
890390 it takes smarts emotional savvy physical ability what it did for me was it gave me that break and it made me feel alive again
890391 shes had some experiences as a head coach i havent been able to have
890392 shes bringing knowledge of tucson and the ua an unbelievable source i have in the office and i couldnt have made a better hire
890393 die entscheidung der schiedskommission ist f r mich absolut inakzeptabel sie ist falsch und muss aus der welt geschaffen werden

890402 we had a lot of strong guys in the race tim johnson kyle gritters and kirk obee were covering a lot of breaks tim closed down a lot of moves
890403 i took off thinking we could get a gap and maybe get a winning move going unfortunately the group got up to about 12 guys and i didnt like the numbers so i just went to the back of the group and tried not to work too much
890404 coming into the final lap the pace wasnt too high so i thought id have a go and try to get a gap and hold it to the line
890405 the finish is such that its not easy to close a gap

890467 all of the volunteers and olympic committee staff were there and there were songs and lots of speeches in chinese which none of us understood
890468 still we stood for the chinese national anthem and i waved the flag
890469 the chinese officials are extremely worried about details of the ceremony leaking to the public so i wont divulge large details but i was amazed by the performance
890470 there had to have been more than 10 000 performers used including high flying fairies thousands of drummers and many aspects of ancient chinese history i am certain spending two and a half hours watching the ceremony is worth your time
890471 there is no way to understand what an olympic city goes through to prepare for visitors from around the world
890472 you dont think about what has to go into preparing to feed visitors from around the world house them transport them from place to place beijing has been doing nothing but working for seven years toward this

890521 some or all of these technologies may be used by other microsoft products going forward
890522 there is no impact on windows vista we announced back in august 2004 that winfs would not be in windows vista
890523 we announced back in august 2004 that winfs would not be in windows vista
890524 a lot of the technology really was database stuff and were putting that into sql and ado but some of the technology especially the end user value points are not ready and were going to continue to work on that in incubation
890525 we believe that including some of the winfs work in sql will broaden which developers will benefit from that database
890526 no in fact the beta was coming together really well
890527 it seems clear to me that microsoft has not been able to come up with a refined end user ui that encapsulates the functionality of winfs so they took the non ui parts and put them into sql and ado net so those parts wouldnt be held hostage to the ui issue microsoft will continue working on the ui and if they can solve that problem theyll ship it theres no big mystery here
890528 gt http gdayworld thepodcastnetwork com 2006 06 28 gday world 137 what happened to winfs and why buy microsoft vista
890529 were only starting to scratch the surface of the power of the pc because winfs is still a holy grail for me ughh for quite some time and here it is
890530 ballmer and there will be some things that were talking about and working on that may take us even more than a two year type cycle
890531 the schools should stay in the neighborhood but the reality is consolidation may be necessary
890532 in this day and age if a building is not handicap accessible thats unacceptable
890533 these buildings were built to last we can renovate and refurbish for a fraction of the cost
890534 i think were preaching to the choir the easiest way to avoid being tested is dropping out of the activity maybe we need more activities starting in the middle schools
890535 why should teachers service personnel and their families support you
890536 im in the schools and classrooms constantly they know i understand the issues
890537 its a real public service to be on the school board
890538 can you offer the courses the kids are going to need to compete in todays society i hardly think so
890539 we need to look at the feeder schools and make reasonable boundary adjustments
890540 im shocked to learn that enrollment has dropped 50 percent since 1950
890541 i dont think the impact of the tech center is the issue
890542 its communicating and informing more people of whats out there
890543 someones got to be the waiter and waitress at shoneys
890544 money to improve beverly hills middle before the planned consolidation
890545 cabell county schools cannot use this money on a building that wont be there
890546 its our intention to keep that building and use it for a long time
890547 the people of cabell county have sent a clear message that they value education and new facilities
890548 its hard to speculate what we would do but their track record and willingness to contribute cabell has done an outstanding job
890549 not to be ungrateful or anything but maybe it pays down a bill but it doesnt pay down every bill every month the short term quick fix kinda stuff sounds good and it may even feel good that first month when you get that check and then you go out and you buy a pair of earrings

890583 actually a local coup d tat by lenin did not remove the romanovs it overthrew the democrats
890584 its not a request we make lightly but the american people are suffering
890585 the consequences of continued congressional inaction on gas prices are unacceptable weve called on the speaker to call congress back into an emergency session this month and schedule a vote on the american energy act we must continue to make a stand until the speaker complies
890586 we realize not everyone can be in washington next week but if you can be we ask that you come to the capitol join our colleagues and lend your voice beginning this monday at 10 00 am
890587 if you cant be in washington we ask that you contribute to the cause in other ways such as spreading the word among your constituents writing an op ed for your local newspaper or taking our all of the above energy message to your local airwaves
890588 republicans stand with the american people we share their passion and determination for energy independence and weve pledged to fight boldly until congress heeds their will
890589 mccain no matter who obama picks you need to start calling it the obama pelosi ticket with harry in waiting
890590 bring this congress back and give the american people a vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil
890591 the american people are hurting from the high price of gasoline and i commend minority leader john boehner minority whip roy blunt and all the republicans in congress who took to the house floor last week to fight for a vote on an energy bill that includes more domestic supply
890592 it was simply wrong for congress to take a five week paid vacation without ever taking a vote on giving the american people more access to american oil
890593 i look forward to joining our leaders and my fellow republicans returning to congress this week this is not a revolt this is democracy in action the american people want congress to address the new energy crisis with comprehensive reform that includes more domestic drilling
890594 the american people will see that house republicans are going to continue to challenge the democrat leadership to bring this congress back and give the american people a vote to lessen our dependence on foreign oil
890595 we need energy we need a solution let us in
890596 when this country needs oil it is forced to listen to others even to concede matters that are the opposite of justice fairness and goodness

890606 and yes they are but it does have impact and influence
890607 although they claimed to be wise they became fools therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another they exchanged the truth of god for a lie because of this god gave them over to shameful lusts even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion furthermore since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god he gave them over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done although they know gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them

890616 with most of our effort now working towards productizing mature aspects of the winfs project into sql and ado net we do not need to deliver a separate winfs offering
890617 oh the exciting stuff will come in katmai this is really what you have asked for this is good news
890618 i hope people see this for what it is winfs has morphed rather than what the naysayers will argue winfs is dead
890619 with most of our effort now working towards productizing mature aspects of the winfs project into sql and ado net we do not need to deliver a separate winfs offering
890620 after multiple years of wasting our share holders s money i hope to see someone to take responsibility for this winfs failure
890621 the key here i think is to not think of death as an end but think of it more of a very effective way of cutting down on your expenses
890622 boy winfs sounds great wish it was only available in sql server
890623 weve worked on advanced file systems before and our customers should be happy to know we dont give up on something thats important to them even if we didnt get it right
890624 get them hooked on the lite version and force an upgrade when they need more power
890625 the only measure of a technologys strategic importance and success at microsoft is the extent to which it is adopted and integrated into other microsoft products
890626 it would seem to me that only a few of the people posting here have installed a recent winfs drop tried any samples or at least understood the most recent implementation of winfs most are likely not developers either i dont mean you of course

890636 yes then i wrote a long letter to the woman who taught me renouncing my association with their religion the book gave me suggestions for what to say
890637 this research helps us to understand how and why our minds change as we get older and why some individuals remain sharp into their 90s while others mental abilities decline as they age
890638 one of the reasons for loss of mental ability may be that these systems in the brain are no longer in sync with one another
890639 understanding why we lose cognitive function as we age may help us to prolong our mental abilities later in life
890640 understanding how the brain changes as people age is an important part of the fight to protect against cognitive diseases such as dementia
890641 people displaying the signs of alzheimers disease were ruled out of the study but those with subtle vascular changes in the brain may have been included
890642 further work is needed to establish if the pattern of change is related to age only or to vascular changes in the brain
890643 it was wonderful there were so many of us and we had such a good time together
890644 i didnt go to the trouble the expense and the time of trademarking freedom of expression just to have someone else come along and think they can use it whenever they want
890645 we wanted to make copyrights problems as real to the average person as they are to our featured artists
890646 elements of our mass media environment to express how the artist feels about our culture
890647 the law presumes that sampling intends to undermine the work of others
890648 when we make our art to critique others were doing it because were inspired by what we find and i think thats true of many collage artists collage has been a legitimate form of art for a long time and its everywhere in todays society
890649 mail these photos to everyone that was at the event

890652 while its good to have a common silo that all apps can easily use its seems a bit risky wouldnt some rogue app spyware have an easier time getting to financial quicken money data
890653 whats the best way to get some data into winfs
890654 what about all the shell improvements in vista how does winfs fit into that
890655 are there any new features in the beta 1 refresh

891018 has a concept of what the next film will be
891019 at this stage where were at now i would personally love to go back to the future you can explore a lot of things however with our film weve opened the door to other interesting projects it could be another period film
891020 our film is less sophisticated not in a bad way its more refined this is a guy film with blood and sweat
891021 i dont feel like anyone is aware of the movie here
891022 were opening the week of tropic thunder i hope people will realize were opening around that same time
891023 its very strange doing the marketing of our movie is so subjective
891024 i tried to put in as much input but its their money so theyll spend it the way they want im just disappointed they havent shown the movie here re comic con we finished it two weeks ago and i really wanted to come here and show it to everyone i think in general when they dont show a movie people think its bad but thats not the case we just finished the movie
891025 i appreciate these films and i appreciate the fact they are trying but im disappointed that the system is not changing in france high tension didnt change anything and almost none of the films that followed were a success in spain you make a horror film and you get the prize you get all of the critics behind you in france you can do whatever you want with a genre movie and its put aside im not sure its going change im convinced theres something cultural thats blocking the system thats why all of filmmakers making genre films there are hoping they can get over here
891026 i came up with the idea of doing it in 3 d and i want the film to open as fast as possible as the first 3 d movie

891032 ive made the decision today to resign as leader of the parliamentary liberal party because i believe its in the best interests of the western australian liberal party
891033 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election
891034 most observers of politics would know that my six months as parliamentary leader has not been without its challenges
891035 however during that time i feel that weve done a good job in holding the government to account when theyve made mistakes
891036 im confident that ive made the right decision im confident ive made an honourable decision

891169 i was outside getting rubbish i started heading over there after i heard the screaming and saw this woman running across the paddock she had blood on her face and masking tape around her neck i grabbed her and took her inside she was terrified
891170 i called the police while my wife was calming her down she was crying and bleeding and was in a pretty bad way
891171 i heard a single scream but thought it was just children i did think it was strange when i saw the white car backed up to the carport with its boot up the guy must have left pretty quick though because when i looked again the white car was gone
891172 she got black eyes and her face is a bit messed up but shes okay she fought non stop with everything she had shes a massive fighter

891192 thousands of voters gathered at the booths well before the voting began there is enthusiasm as these are the first polls in years and we havent had any reports of any untoward incidents
891193 it will send a positive signal to everyone that the country is heading towards free and fair polls in the third week of december this year the voting also gives us the chance to see how the digital voter list works

891201 the last four years have been great for me and i believe i am at my peak
891202 i am at a good age and if i didnt come to liverpool now maybe the opportunity wouldnt come again
891203 spurs have been knocking on the door of the top four in recent years apart from last years slump
891204 theyre not that far behind liverpool in league terms so its not such a massive jump the only real difference is theres much more to liverpool in terms of their champions league form
891205 he will be a big plus to liverpool he did manage to adapt to squad rotation at spurs eventually he had a bit of a scorpy head on him when
891206 hes more mature now has more variety now than merely being a front player because most clubs are now using a big guy up front so robbie has had to adapt his game
891207 liverpool are a very coached team and robbie may have to adapt to playing within a structure alternatively it could be the case that benitez will retain the structure and robbie will be the one guy there allowed to have the freedom to break things up
891208 one of liverpools problems last year was at home they couldnt break a lot of teams down even though they have width anfield isnt that wide a pitch so theyve lacked invention in the middle thats where robbie could be more relevant to liverpool theyll both get a lot out of it
891209 his goalscoring record hasnt been great in the last couple of years maybe because hes been playing further away from goal
891210 and his goalscoring record at club level hasnt been converted into goalscoring form at international level
891211 but i think he could be on the verge of something hes been working very hard and his general play and decision making has improved we need him to be getting more goals for ireland
891212 hes maturing more as well the move wont do him any harm in terms of ireland but its hard to see it having an overly positive effect
891213 i met him two weeks ago and he looked in great shape
891214 he said he was over all his problems and he was looking forward to the new season
891215 one of the problems though is that theres not a lot of stability and consistency at the club damien needs confidence from the manager now keegan is that kind of manager but damien needs to give the manager a reason to be confident in him
891216 its a new season theres new hope and theres no reason why it cant happen for him
891217 hes one of the few players ive met who loves the game and loves being at matches the injured duff travelled away to
891218 he has a good mental approach and he wont blame anybody but himself i hope he can do it
891219 we have begun receiving reports of deaths resulting from hunger and so far 15 have been brought to my attention i have told my people in the district to use what food they have in the granaries sparingly but there is also need for relief support
891220 the harvest last year did not favour our people we are calling for an immediate intervention
891221 others have moved to neighbouring districts and the turkana region where relief food is currently being distributed
891222 and since the string is unique the gethashcode on the string will definitely generate a unique hash code
891223 since you are generating hashcode explicitly which is guaranteed to be unique
891224 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
891225 people started pushing their way back and many women and children fell down whoever fell down was trampled upon by the surge of devotees
891226 were very concerned that a lot of people it would appear have been taken in by a very professional scam and theres a lot of money that appears to have gone under
891227 well collect as much information as possible for the accc the australian competition and consumer commission as well as international law enforcement agencies
891228 we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate find substitute tickets or whatever

891230 security has been extremely tight with police and elite rapid action battalion force on guard at and around the voting stations
891231 i have been able to vote without any hassle at all because of the photographic id this has been immensely helpful to voters and polling officials
891232 voting has been highly disciplined and peaceful in the first one and half hours
891233 we hope order will prevail till the voting closes at 4 p m 6 a m edt on monday
891234 voting is progressing smoothly and so far we have noticed no anomaly or breach of the codes of conduct
891235 we will make a statement possibly tomorrow after the voting is completed
891236 this is the first opportunity we have in many years to elect a mayor and councilors in a free and unintimidating atmosphere
891237 voting process has been a bit slow in the first hours because the voters polling officials and agents of candidates are not very familiar with the use of id cards
891238 it takes some time to verify voters with id cards but the process will gain speed soon

891244 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
891245 one dutch was rescued by helicopter from k2 this morning while an italian is still at an altitude of 7 200 metres
891246 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
891247 the three mountaineers who survived are suffering from severe frostbite
891248 they are badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
891249 the rope collapsed and the climbers started falling in various directions some fell in neighbouring
891250 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
891251 i was terrified that he would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
891252 we had a feeling this would not turn out well and decided to turn around the accident could have been prevented these mountains lure out way too inexperienced and naive people

891278 wenn ich erst einmal abgenommen habe f hle ich mich besser und gl cklicher
891279 i was actually checking my email a few days ago and i got an email release from the ifl and yesterday i got a letter saying thanks for being with the ifl were exercising our right to release you so youre free to fight with any organization out there
891280 it didnt really bother me the way it happened i was waiting for the day to come
891281 i look back at the ifl now and i realize it was really important for me in my progression from the smaller shows to the big shows
891282 i had tough fights it made me realize what i needed to change in my game and was a real eye opener i really advanced who i am through the ifl and im thankful for that opportunity it was a great experience
891283 im kind of getting the reputation at our gym as the new jeremy horn like as the corner man guy
891284 im just going to all the fights and now i think im ready for my shot
891285 i figure 16 3 with one no contest now i should be getting a three fight deal somewhere some big opportunities
891286 the only two guys i lost to in the ifl were reese andy and andre gussamo and theyre both ufc veterans now so its not like i lost a fight i shouldnt have
891287 the guys i lost to are on the same level as me and now theyre fighting in the big show
891288 i love the idea of fighting somebody with a name getting out there and show that i belong im ready to get in there do my thing and show that i can compete with those guys
891289 i dont know if i really have a preference where i fight i just want an opportunity to fight on a world class level or ppv type level the only way to know if im ready for that level or not is to put me in there with someone
891290 theres not a fight at 205 that ill turn down if they offer it
891291 i hope people are looking forward to seeing me fight im ready to go out there and put on a show and ill fight anybody
891292 to the people on the message boards dont forget to throw my name out there when youre talking about whos fighting what guy or whos filling in
891293 its often thought that kids dont do well because theyre dumb and theres nothing we can do about it
891294 but not only is executive function pivotal for academic success its amenable to training and this training might make a big difference in a child s ability
891295 the fact that executive function even in children this young is significantly related to early math performance suggests that if we can improve executive function we can improve their academic performance
891296 we are going to make a big big difference in the american marketplace
891297 we are ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need to do their job
891298 toxic chemicals like lead and phthalates have no business in our childrens toys
891299 safety testing and certification for such hazards as powerful magnets before products are sold a ban on lead and phthalates and more will helpfully put an end to the recalls of childrens products and the horror stories that lead to those recalls
891300 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
891301 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
891302 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
891303 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
891304 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
891305 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
891306 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
891307 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
891308 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
891309 my god my god this thing is not to scale
891310 one inch on the map is like so far in reality
891311 gray dawn how the coming age wave will transform america
891312 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
891313 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
891314 been adjudicated as a mental defective or been committed to any mental institution
891315 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
891316 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
891317 a fellow christian may believe they have a profound fresh insight
891318 but the christian with the new insight cant claim straight away that this is now what the church of god believes or intends
891319 for people who think that this is going to lead us to disenfranchise any gay or lesbian person they are sadly mistaken
891320 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
891321 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
891322 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
891323 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
891324 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
891325 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care
891326 what about christs bodily re appearance during his second coming
891327 the inflow has certainly improved and over 35 tmc ft of water has flowed through here power generation too may look up
891328 goddess cauvery has at last answered our prayers and smiled on us benevolently not only will we have a decent harvest the shortage of electric power too will be a thing of the past soon
891329 the gods always test their devotees but eventually bless their true ones seven generations of our family have worshipped mother cauvery without fail
891330 when the water is less we protest against the government and pray to the gods it seems both have borne fruit this year
891331 the opposition thought it could attack us on the scanty rains earlier that led to a chain reaction of water and power shortage mercifully we have been spared more trouble
891332 the electricity and water situation is bound to improve and people will return to their work
891333 the insurance companies often act in an unreasonable manner and after having accepted the value of a particular insured goods disown that very figure on one pretext or the other when they are called upon to pay compensation
891334 this take it or leave it attitude is clearly unwarranted not only as being bad in law but ethically indefensible
891335 it is therefore obvious that in the light of this stringent provision and being in a dominant position the insurance companies often act in an unreasonable manner
891336 india is one of the biggest aid donors to afghanistan
891337 from a geopolitical and aid stand the issue for india will be about how to improve security as ties grow closer
891338 i am not expecting any dramatic shift in relations relations are as close as they can be
891339 but we may see a common hardening of their posture to pakistan and india may even announce more aid programs for afghanistan
891340 en el pa s vasco estamos solos muy solos pero con la cabeza bien alta

891352 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
891353 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
891354 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
891355 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
891356 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
891357 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
891358 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
891359 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
891360 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
891361 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
891362 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
891363 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
891364 berpeganglah kamu semuanya dengan tali agama allah dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai
891365 sesungguhnya agama tauhid ini adalah agama kamu semua agama yang satu
891366 sesungguhnya orang orang yang memecah belah agamanya dan mereka terpecah menjadi beberapa golongan tidak sedikit pun kamu termasuk dari mereka
891367 yaitu orang yang menempuh jalan seperti yang telah aku tempuh dan para shahabatku hari ini
891368 dan jika mereka berpaling sesungguhnya mereka berada dalam permusuhan dengan kamu
891369 akhir umat ini tidak akan bisa diperbaiki kecuali dengan apa yang telah mampu memperbaiki generasi awalnya sunnah pent
891370 orang orang yang terdahulu lagi yang pertama tama masuk islah di antara orang orang muhajirin dan anshar dan orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik allah ridha kepada mereka dan mereka pun ridha kepada allah dan allah menyediakan bagi mereka surga surga
891371 wii music completes what miyamoto wrote in his proposal when he came up with the idea for the wii he was saying that he needs to think up more ideas now
891372 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
891373 bertakwalah kepada allah wahai fathimah dan bersabarlah dan aku adalah sebaik baik salaf pendahulu bagimu
891374 saya pengikut para salafus shalih dalam segala apa yang ada pada mereka baik dalam beraqidah ibadah maupun berakhlak
891375 hai orang orang yang beriman taatilah allah dan rasul nya serta ulil amri ulama dan umara di antara kamu kemudian jika kamu berselisih pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah hal itu kepada allah dan rasul as sunnah bila kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
891376 barang siapa menentang rasul setelah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti selain jalannya sabilil mukminin para shahabat maka kami biarkan dia tenggelam dalam kesesatan berpalingnya dia dari kebenaran dan kami masukkan ke neraka jahannam
891377 golongan itu ialah yang mengikuti sunnahku dan sunnah para shahabatku hari ini
891378 wajib bagi kalian berpegang teguh dengan sunnahku dan sunnah khulafaur rasyidin yang mendapat petunjuk sesudahku
891379 kami memahami dan as sunnah dengan pemahaman sendiri tanpa memandang sedikitpun pada pemahaman salafus sholih
891380 saya seorang muslim yang mengikuti dan as sunnah sesuai dengan manhaj salafus shalih
891381 cukuplah bagimu perbedaan diantara kita ini dan setiap bejana akan memancarkan air yang ada di dalamnya
891382 we got lucky with our online gaming software domain name it wasnt registered so it only cost a few dollars
891383 the only thing worse than dying is the death of feeling while youre living
891384 hey there little boy they call me chocolate and any thing i say in words there is no stoppin it
891385 this voicemail box is not maintained on a daily basis
891386 israeli authorities halted the process however as they received information that they were being arrested by hamas
891387 we dont have any choice we have to reduce the gap between us and the hamas movement
891388 even if the ban is not fully lifted we may export 2 3 million tonnes after november to some african countries

891390 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well
891391 sebi will have to change its listing agreement norms for india inc to adopt international financial reporting system ifrs
891392 the rice was not tasty as it used to be nor is my son as healthy as i was in his age
891393 you can get a much lower rate below 8 per cent of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on
891394 as things stand perhaps to look at a rate of inflation of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
891395 the transaction between the assessee and his grandfather can be viewed as financial help coming from elders in the family
891396 there are not many acquisition targets currently in india but we may look at the potential opportunities in the internet space that are aligned to our business model if valuations correct
891397 we had been approached as potential takeover target prior to going public but we have always made it clear that the company is not for sale and moreover there have been no approaches ever since the companys listing
891398 but if something interesting comes up we would take a call at that point of time
891399 one thing thats on my list is to stop pau from winning a gold medal
891400 our guys get it they really do understand whats at stake here
891401 there has to be a goal an objective above fixing the house of pain
891402 ultimately that results in that goal of winning a gold medal we not only have a goal to win it we want people to respect us
891403 weve been very arrogant about the game and said its our game its the worlds game it originated here
891404 the respect weve shown to international basketball over the past two years has shown dividends and well continue that respect and show the best we can be on the world stage i love my guys they will represent us well in beijing
891405 zydrunas is an important member of our team and has generally been a higher risk player
891406 in light of the inability to insure zydrunas adequately we will not permit zydrunas to play in the olympics
891407 we did lose in the world championships but we havent lost in the olympics and were going back to defend our gold
891408 russia and australia have changed their style to be competitive with us an uptempo style but also physical american players are the best in the world at that style so i think if our players come together well be fine
891409 monkeys lounging around watching television in the middle of the morning theyll turn into tv zombies take their goggle box immediately
891410 whats the point of a hairy king who hides away
891411 tell his majesty that the visitors have paid good money to see his ugly face and in future he had better show it
891412 there are far too many scroungers layabouts and free loaders in this zoo i want every primate and yes that includes the keepers i want every quadruped every bird fish reptile and every last tiny insect to understand this from now on if they want to eat they must provide value for money
891413 keep those monkey minds occupied and they will stay out of trouble
891414 so it turns out that the naughtiest monkey of them all is the brainiest
891415 if a bunch of creatures are too lazy to get out of bed in the morning how would you know when they go on strike in any case well just stop their food and then well see how long the strike lasts
891416 what harm can come of it its not as if monkeys know how to turn keys in locks
891417 yes there has been a minor incident but now all the animals have returned to their cages
891418 sir how on earth did you persuade wild creatures to do that
891419 long experience of zoo work and a touch of that animal magic

891500 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
891501 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
891502 the threat remains moderate but slightly elevated because of the olympics

891524 we were working on one of my solo records beautiful door and j d andrew and i just hit up on this sound then we got mike butler involved in it because we needed a lead guitar player and the chemistry was just there the band was really based on our love of 60s music both hillbilly music and the british invasion and the cosmic cowboy music of mike nesmith and the dirt band and people like that
891525 we all grew up in rural areas and we all have similar influences we all love early 60s electric hillbilly stuff and have been really influenced by the whole british invasion bands from the 60s it sort of came naturally the three of us had a chemistry musically right away
891526 im the trashy guitar player who cant play a lead guitar solo to save his life
891527 thats the attitude we have this is rock n roll and were going to play it the way we want to if its trashy or if its loose feeling thats just how we play mike and i both know how to make records where every note is perfectly on the beat and soulless and awful sounding but thats whats ruined music the last 10 or 15 years is perfection in a nonhuman way
891528 well weve already finished a christmas record for vanguard and weve already finished the next boxmasters record that comes out next spring so we take it very seriously its no more of a lark than what the kinks or the animals or hermans hermits or anybody would have been

891530 i dont think people were anticipating the song to be that good
891531 its a good song regardless of who sings it but having her sing it whether you like her or hate her everybody knows who jessica simpson is
891532 and i think theres a lot of credibility that she co wrote the song
891533 shes done what a lot of newcomers and established stars have done by putting out fun up tempo put the top down and cruise type songs

891538 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
891539 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
891540 it was important that that was stated quite clearly in the platform
891541 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs

891553 on top of everything the cancer wing was number 13 pavel nikolayevich rusanov had never been and could never be a superstitious person but his heart sank when they wrote wing 13 on his admission card they should have had the ingenuity to assign number 13 to some kind of prosthetic or intestinal department

891563 you are aimed toward material values you may make a good businessman
891564 most people want to resolve personal problems with their characters or see how their spiritual development is proceeding
891565 its difficult for me to really seriously judge but i do believe it has some cosmic force
891566 they say the pyramid charges everything here with special energy i was always curious about it
891567 it is historys sorrow the grief of our era that i carry about me like an anathema
891568 an unquenchable thirst for life and incredible powers of concentration
891569 he felt positively uncomfortable without a hair shirt of some kind
891570 the spiritual impotence that comes from living a life of ease
891571 we will try to win from the first game and then see the situation
891572 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
891573 we started really well and finished really well last season
891574 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
891575 but we will be working really hard to be as competitive as we can

891589 environmental degradation is a major problem in africa and the institute wants
891590 i think ive thrown enough good games during that stretch to not reinvent the wheel
891591 there is struggling there is not feeling comfortable and theres not winning those are totally different things
891592 i felt good about how i was throwing the ball i didnt win some games you would normally win
891593 greg bases a lot of his work on his performance and he was throwing the ball well
891594 because of his experience his head he might not let that stretch affect him like a younger pitcher would he kept doing the same things every five days
891595 he was really pounding the zone and throwing strikes it was fun to watch
891596 i was just trying to find the strike zone and i ended up throwing it up and away it was a pitch that a pitcher can handle
891597 when he gets an rbi on top of that its hard to beat him
891598 hes had our number and today he did it again
891599 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
891600 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
891601 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
891602 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
891603 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
891604 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
891605 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
891606 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
891607 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
891608 hes always saying if you play low and play fast you can create a lot of plays
891609 you tell yourself its going to happen this play you tell yourself that youre going to create this play sometimes what you have to do is play the play in your mind before it happens
891610 last year it was a matter of getting back there and just hoping that things fall your way now its more of taking it upon yourself to create those opportunities for yourself and for your teammates thats what im focusing on not just hoping for turnovers but creating them
891611 patrick willis today is not the patrick willis of last year
891612 a year ago he was just a garden gnome in a field if you told him to stand there he did very robotic

891614 we understand that there are improvements to be made and thats what makes the process more enjoyable
891615 you have something to strive for i think these olympics will be special because of the hype the anticipation other countries have to see if we can dethrone argentina but they 2004 holdovers say this team is much more cohesive more united

891618 in the past there were too many people involved in making the decisions and it wasnt very successful weve changed that culture and im very proud of that
891619 that wasnt going to happen again that was a one time thing the highlight of my career you cant repeat that you just move on
891620 that may have been the first time ive ever coached third and i dont want to do it
891621 id like to think well be much improved on offense
891622 theyre kind of the heart and soul of our team right now
891623 they need to step up and provide the leadership and tempo of play we need to win
891624 theyre all quality kids that can do that for us

891886 the shortage of helicopters for the peace keeping operations of the united nations nato and the eu is a long standing problem along with darfur it has been seen in chad and afghanistan
891887 although the czech republic has a relatively high number of helicopters most of them are not technically suitable for such operations their modernisation or replacement is impossible in the short run other countries are facing similar problems

891917 david lost the joy of the lords salvation in his life
891918 there are ways of finding out the answer for example
891919 and has the joy gone out of your christian pilgrimage
891920 but to remember the time where you first knew the joy of the lord sometimes the joy of the lords salvation is stolen because youve become a depleted vessel and many times you get depleted because you dont wait upon the lord david said in
891921 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry
891922 they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint

891929 but as far as the games are concerned we trust the authorities are doing everything humanly possible to ensure a safe and secure event
891930 we shouldnt automatically make any link to the games if the authorities decide it is necessary to brief us they will
891931 we also consulted all the cities which organised previous games to be inspired from their experience
891932 well be working with our international agency contacts throughout the world providing them with whatever information that we can but im afraid to say australians are just amongst the large number of those internationally who have been caught by the scam
891933 i starting making the phone calls to find out exactly the date that they were going be here the tickets and the phone rang out and i thought thats a bit unusual
891934 so i stated sending emails and i got no responses and then i started doing a bit more investigative work as far as looking at the company how it exists and found that even as early as march people were complaining in london that it was a scam
891935 if you put beijing olympic tickets in to google this was the first site that came up and in fact it came up ahead of the official chinese olympic site so how is it that a site like that could have operated at least 11 months if not longer without anyone in officialdom taking any sort or action against them

891945 performance of mutual funds was poor in the first half of this year all factors important for domestic investors were negative
891946 the latest data confirm that the favourable trend on the labour market continues still pulled mainly by the strong economic growth which helps create jobs cutting of social benefits also plays a role as it forces many people to start to look for a job
891947 this will be mainly owing to a slower growth in domestic and foreign demand
891948 the bank board will be discussing many opposing factors on august 7 but i think that a clear signal for the markets in the form of a rate cut though a moderate one should be made right now
891949 but it would have to be a dramatic weakening so as to convince the central bankers about a sufficient easing of monetary conditions
891950 the most likely scenario is that the cnb will for now leave interest rates unchanged at 3 75 percent waiting to see what will be the impact of the strong crown on the economy
891951 rate stabilisation for the rest of the year therefore seems to be the best forecast at the moment
891952 if the bank board decides to make no changes in rates the threat of lower rates will still be hanging in the air
891953 over the last decade electronic word of mouth ewom behavior arguably has been one of the biggest factors impacting marketing public relations and advertising programs the online phenomenon is transforming this once one on one private verbal exchange form into a one to many instant propagation machine this proliferating force affects consumer decisions making it of critical interest to anyone responsible for brand or issue management as with any new phenomenon its real impact is evolving rapidly in this case as with other things new some of the hype about how it can be measured and managed may also have gotten ahead of reality our belief is that there is considerable opportunity to integrate measures of ewom with other consumer opinion measurement tools but that the unique characteristics of ewom raise caution flags we also believe that efforts to harness online wom are important though we are intrigued perhaps concerned with the intermingling of measurement and marketing activities

891972 i am sure there is a future state i believe god is good i can resign my immortal part to him without any misgiving god is my father god is my friend i love him i believe he loves me
891973 it is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world cut adrift from every connection uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted
891974 i could not help it the restlessness was in my nature it agitated me to pain sometimes it is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity they must have action and they will make it if they cannot find it
891975 he could not bound all that he had in his nature the rover the aspirant the poet the priest in the limits of a single passion
891976 when i asked him if he forgave me he answered that he was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation that he had nothing to forgive not have been offended and with that answer he left me i would much rather he had knocked me down
891977 his nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer it was only elevated

891979 unusual atmospheric conditions set up wind patterns that compressed the sea ice loaded it into the transpolar drift stream and then sped its flow out of the arctic

891990 recent years are clearly one of the richest years of the last decade
891991 euthanasia results in physicians being given the right to deliberately end a persons life usually that person is nearing death or has requested it but when we look at the results in the netherlands we recognize that when euthanasia is legal many physicians will take the law in their own hands
891992 in belgium a government minister admitted that there is an under reporting problem in that country that simply means that there are a lot of deaths that are never reported and the circumstances of those acts are unknown
891993 in oregon belgium and the netherlands the reporting of euthanasia or assisted suicide is done by the doctor who did the act will a physician honestly report a case that is outside of the law will they report at all
891994 a lot of people say that the oregon model has worked but once again there are several stories of abuses in oregon and the government has given itself no power to investigate and there are no reviews of the actual reports to confirm honesty in reporting
891995 finally decisions concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide are made at the most vulnerable time in a persons life
891996 what is really needed is a goal of providing better care for dying people better pain control better psychological support social support to ensure that fewer people die alone we need to promote a caring society not a society that permits the killing of its most vulnerable citizens
891997 nobody has a right to euthanize themselves or anybody else that in itself is already abuse couple that with people starving their relatives who are breathing on their own and simply handicapped

892010 at 15 to 20 mph speed tables are much smoother than speed bumps which are rough even when youre going really slow
892011 the speed tables cause less wear and tear on vehicles if they are still going through there at 30 to 40 mph they deserve what they get
892012 just like all over pensacola a lot of drivers dont pay attention to the speed limits posted
892013 i worry about the kids mostly speed tables are better than speed bumps because they dont seem to have the same harsh effect on the cars if youre going the right speed if youre going the wrong speed then either of them will do it
892014 you have so many events especially athletic events where students think its after school hours and i can get away with wearing something i would not normally wear at school

892022 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
892023 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 percent or so still is very useful for us
892024 we understand they are disappointed because they had been awaiting for the approval but did not obtain it within the time of period they expected
892025 but china oriental and arcelormittal have so far never talked about giving up raising the stake
892026 their state is terrible they were inundated up to the roof they stood in water and the zoo did not care of them

892051 in a season which traditionally has been known for its revelry pageantry and cultural display this evening i address you with a great sense of sadness
892052 antigua and barbuda has long been a nation of law abiding citizens and residents we have come to cherish the peace and security that our nation has enjoyed and shared with our numerous visitors from the united kingdom united states europe and other parts of the world
892053 in the past decade however we have been nearly overwhelmed by events of crime and violence that are alien to this part of the world which for generations has been characterised by peace and tranquility and i know that every law abiding person in antigua and barbuda is concerned
892054 over the last several weeks in particular the nations sensibilities have been outraged by the continuing incidents of rapes robberies and shootings most recently the wanton slaying of a young antiguan pursuing studies in cuba rafique kareem harris and the senseless killing of a 31 year old british tourist dr catherine mullany and the shooting of her husband ben
892055 the nations sympathies go out to the relatives and friends of these victims and indeed all who have been victims of such violence beyond sympathy however i assure you that we will employ every legal measure to hunt down and bring to justice those who are responsible for the senseless acts
892056 the rising incidence of crime and violence in our society is of serious concern to your government
892057 the truth is unpalatable to some people but the recent killing of dr mullany and the brutal attack on her husband are threats to our very survival as they directly threaten our main industry tourism
892058 our nation has always been known as a safe destination
892059 accordingly your government will not tolerate any action that will tarnish the reputation of this country
892060 earlier this week i was advised of the arrest of a jamaican who was deported from the united kingdom to jamaica from whence he was deported again this time to antigua on the basis of a fraudulently obtained antigua amp barbuda passport
892061 no longer can any of us afford to give comfort and shelter to those who break the law and wreak havoc on the society
892062 while our law officials are mandated to provide a greater sense of security to every resident and visitor you too as citizens and residents must place a greater sense of trust in them as they carry out their duties
892063 you too must take personal responsibility and play your part in our fight against crime to ensure the safety of each other
892064 this is my clarion call to all regardless of nationality or political affiliation seventeen year old ken watkins junior all the young victims of crime and their families and friends are depending on you
892065 it is a fact that this country has made significant gains over the past four years and as a government and a people we cannot allow lawlessness and crime to erode the tangible benefits and the quality of life that our country now enjoys
892066 however we need the help of not only every citizen and resident but we need the help of our international partners
892067 year after year we have seen a marked increase in the number of criminals being deported from the united kingdom and the united states back to the caribbean over 280 criminals have been deported back to our 108 square mile island during the past 10 years
892068 to any small island developing state this figure is astronomically high in ours particularly with its small population these criminal deportees with skills developed and nurtured in the us and uk are impacting tremendously on our society
892069 we as the caribbean community have raised our concerns with our international partners however the criminals are still being deported in many cases they are being sent to countries with which they have little or no connection except for the fact that they were born here
892070 every citizen and resident deserves to live in peace and security and your government will ensure that this remains true for our nation
892071 since 2004 we have instituted a number of measures to counteract crime in our country and we will necessarily be getting tougher
892072 hence it is the intention of my government to tighten immigration procedures and practices and shortly we will take to parliament legislation aimed at monitoring deportees to this country and deporting convicted criminals from this country
892073 just as important we will move to implement the legislation that governs the vetting of security firms and their employees
892074 my government also recognises that illegal firearms are being used to commit various crimes across the country
892075 these extraordinary times and crimes call for extraordinary measures as a result my government plans to install surveillance cameras in strategic locations and is considering the introduction of wire tapping legislation
892076 i am pleased to report to you as well that my government has made a formal request of scotland yard for its assistance in cracking the number of unsolved murders still on the books
892077 while some of these measures may inconvenience some citizens and residents we believe that the majority of persons those who long for justice not only to be done but be seen to be done will welcome these initiatives in the long term interest of the nation of antigua amp barbuda
892078 despite the recent occurrences antigua and barbuda has managed so far to maintain a relatively low crime rate despite the caribbeans growing problem with crime and violence
892079 visitors from all over the world came to our shores for cricket world cup and for the stanford 20 20 tournament and were able to enjoy the games and activities in relative peace and safety
892080 in a concerted effort to take back our country and recapture our sense of security the united evangelical association the antigua christian council the independent churches association the national intercessory network and women against rape will be conducting a national day of prayer and fasting on sunday august 24 beginning at 6am
892081 i urge all citizens and residents of this country to join this national initiative as we seek the assistance of a higher power to aid our earthly efforts
892082 in closing once again i express the sympathies of my family and the government and people of antigua and barbuda to those who have experienced directly and indirectly acts of crime and violence
892083 as chief servant of this nation i pledge my governments commitment to ensuring that our nation remains a paradise
892084 there is not a hope in hell of him going straight we tagged them as an up and coming crime group and they continue to be they are australia wide they just know how to keep off the radar

892086 onder de illegale aanbieders van reizen gaat nu al het gerucht dat ze niet veel hoeven te vrezen omdat de overheid toch niet optreedt
892087 niet alleen de eerlijke reisbureaus zijn daar de dupe van omdat de illegale kantoren goedkopere reizen kunnen aanbieden ook de klanten zijn het slachtoffer omdat zij bij een falen van het reisbureau niet beschermd zijn en hun geld nooit kunnen terugzien
892088 in het voorjaar hebben onze controleurs 27 dossiers geopend waarvan 21 dossiers over hotels en campings en 6 dossiers over reisbureaus drie reisbureaus kregen een boete tussen de 2 000 en 9 000 euro

892097 traditionally social services for people living with hiv were set up by and for gay men
892098 up until fairly recently the vast majority of begins service users were gay men

892101 l had to hide in my flat for quite some time until begin helped me out

892104 therell be young women and young men out there who are straight and who have hiv
892105 this will be a chance to get together and be on the same wavelength
892106 there is still an epidemic amongst gay men and there is an imported epidemic amongst african people in the uk but those groups arent always distinct
892107 we know for example that african men are over represented amongst homosexually acquired hiv infection so there are often crossovers in infection but thats not often talked about

892185 in a number of heavily affected countries such as kenya rwanda uganda and zimbabwe dramatic changes in sexual behaviour have been accompanied by declines in the number of new infections
892186 this is one of the biggest pandemics the world is facing
892187 with our grant making program we can widen the halo
892188 the scale up of antiretroviral therapy in the developing world is the most ambitious public health undertaking of our lifetimes we were told it couldnt be done and shouldnt be done but we persevered set ambitious goals and targets and now 3 million people are on antiretroviral treatment
892189 left behind black america a neglected priority in the global aids epidemic
892190 issing the target 6 the hiv aids response and health systems building on success to achieve health care for all the report is available at
892191 the report shows that each country situation is complex every country has made thousands of decisions good and bad what we are seeing now is that funding for hiv is for the first time in history directed at chronic care for a chronic condition we have the opportunity to think hard about what it will take to keep a large population of people healthy over their entire lives what we know is that it takes more than just antiretrovirals this report takes us to the point of reformulating in a fundamental way the argument over hiv and health systems
892192 what we found was that hiv aids services particularly provision of antiretrivirals have become a lifeline for the health care system in zimbabwe in the midst of the economic and political crises a consistent focus on hiv health services has been an oasis in a whole desert of the collapsing health delivery system
892193 some donors such as the global fund have come together to provide much needed financial resources for zimbabwe
892194 for example efforts have been made to invest in infrastructure through hiv programs which has boosted the general health delivery system
892195 in brazil hiv aids services have been scaled up in conjunction with the expansion of general public health the scale up of aids services has also had positive impacts on human rights education and sexuality in brazil
892196 despite the success of integrating hiv and general health systems we still identified clear and distinct benefits for maintaining dedicated hiv related services
892197 the aids response in zimbabwe brazil and other countries shows that new investments in health can have dramatic impact but a simple reshuffling of health resources toward more generalized health functions at the expense of effective disease specific programs such as hiv aids would jeopardize the remarkable advances that have been made and leave the more than six million people who urgently need aids treatment without this care
892198 the scale up of antiretroviral therapy in the developing world is the most ambitious public health undertaking of our lifetimes
892199 we were told it couldnt be done and shouldnt be done but we persevered set ambitious goals and targets and now 3 million people are on antiretroviral treatment
892200 aids is a disease of primary health care and we need to strengthen health systems to provide for the future of aids treatment
892201 we are the heirs of alma ata we will make comprehensive primary care health for all a reality well be told again that it is impossible well weve done the impossible and will do it again what itpc is about is finding out what people need and what is happening on the ground and then pushing to make the changes that will save peoples lives
892202 if the uns health related millennium development goals mdgs are to have and chance of being realized we need to do for health systems what weve done for aids while increasing the momentum of the response to aids
892203 many said it could not be done but the bill is now law
892204 however there are still us policies that stand as serious barriers to aids prevention and sexual and reproductive health and we will continue to challenge these harmful policies but the passage of this bill is a huge step forward for people with aids worldwide
892205 millions of people living with or at risk for aids tuberculosis and malaria can look forward to new hope and support thanks to the leadership and staff of rep
892206 these leaders would not have been successful without the strong support they got from representative lee payne and waxman as well as senators reid feingold kennedy kerry and coleman hagel specter along with others
892207 this much derided ban has no place in public policy and only reinforces the stigma associated with hiv infection
892208 finally the us has joined almost every other nation in removing discriminatory barriers against the travel and immigration rights of people living with hiv
892209 groups from across the political spectrum raised a ruckus in their respective ways and senator reid stepped up and made it a priority to pass this legislation
892210 lifesaving provisions on treatment prevention and care were stripped from the bill as a result of compromises
892211 this bill is a major step forward but critical changes are still needed

892230 niet alleen de eerlijke reisbureaus zijn daar de dupe van omdat de illegale kantoren goedkopere reizen kunnen aanbieden ook de klanten zijn het slachtoffer omdat zij bij een falen van het reisbureau niet beschermd zijn en hun geld nooit kunnen terugzien
892231 in het voorjaar hebben onze controleurs 27 dossiers geopend waarvan 21 dossiers over hotels en campings en 6 dossiers over reisbureaus drie reisbureaus kregen een boete tussen de 2 000 en 9 000 euro

892253 the banks are there to help us grow our businesses likewise we are also helping to grow their businesses already many financial institutions have complained bitterly about repayment of loans taken by consumers simply because of high interest rates charged by these institutions now the situation has been worsened and if the banks adjust to the recent rate announced by the central bank it means we can no longer access loans for our businesses there should be other measures apart from increasing prime rate to deal with inflation

892267 the potential for instability will be magnified should the sub prime crisis lead to a global economic slowdown
892268 a prolonged economic downturn could fuel nationalism undermine regional cooperation and bring about confrontation over long standing territorial and other disputes

892270 on different pretexts sukhumi tried to refuse from participation in the berlin meeting and decided to use for this purpose aggravation of the situation in the south ossetian conflict area
892271 this number returns the focus to the terrible near term outlook for inflation
892272 our view is that the mpc monetary policy committee will have a very interesting discussion in august but will keep interest rates on hold
892273 we think the bank will raise interest rates by half a percentage point in august and that will be the last hike in this cycle but it will be a very close call
892274 the statement will obviously bring some relief to consumers on expansion of the limit
892275 we have reached a stage where economics is dictating the pace of things that happen on politics which is a good base for economic recovery
892276 however the governor will have to address the issue of agriculture production as it remains key to the sustainable turnaround of the economy
892277 i think the statement was a stop gap measure as it concentrated on currency reform and cash limits
892278 this was necessary perhaps as the governor was guided by developments on the political scene we hope a more comprehensive monetary policy statement will be released when all these things on the political side have been cleared
892279 it is good for the country to be operating with real money and the removal of bearer cheques has reinstated the countrys sovereignty
892280 what is now required is for all stakeholders to unite and defend the currency from being eroded
892281 at least we can get reasonable cash from banks but these limits must be regularly reviewed
892282 even before he dr gono raised the limit from 100 billion a trillion had already become meaningless he should have put daily limit at 5 trillion
892283 imagine at a time when zimbabwe is no longer receiving the paper for printing money and at a time when potential suppliers are likely to be threatened by the west for doing business with zimbabwe the governor has come up with a solution the man is full of surprises
892284 with this acquisition we have helped cmf to achieve a long standing desire to attain full commercial bank status needed to offer a full range of financial services to customers
892285 although the acquisition has been completed global trust bank will continue to operate under the current cmf branded premises until integration processes are completed
892286 the acquisition of cmf by global trust banks aligns with our global focus which is anchored on a national operation that conforms to global best practice
892287 we began our africa expansion drive about three years ago and we are committed to its successful implementation
892288 the only way zimbabwe is ever going to get out of the economic morass it finds itself is to produce its way out the lifting of sanctions will help a bit but will not be a panacea
892289 within the context of the social contract zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
892290 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
892291 the stage where the economy is therefore requires nothing short of a total change of approach and commitment by all stakeholders to arrest the speculative bubble through the moratorium route
892292 the six months moratorium is suggested here as the most credible foundation and seed for the re transformation of market trends and micro level pricing behaviour into stable and predictable modes
892293 will allow the swift implementation of supportive and more comprehensive reforms that would engender medium to long term stability in the countrys price income formation system
892294 the expeditious resolution of the current political differences among the countrys major political players to create an environment marked by a deep sense of national cohesion and unity of purpose in committing to resolve the economic challenges facing the country
892295 an immediate unified call by all zimbabweans across the board for the lifting of the illegal sanctions against zimbabwe
892296 reduce the reliance on monetary financing of the fiscal budget through this there will be scope for the rapid deceleration of money supply growth
892297 we intend to get into the power station to do whatever we can to stop it operating that day we want to send a very strong message to say new coal is absolute madness and we simply wont allow it
892298 our main concerns are that coal fired powered stations are worse in terms of co2 production even than oil or gas fired power stations
892299 it would symbolically be very unfortunate if the uk were to approve a coal fired power station without imposing very strict requirements that some technology should be adopted that would allow it to capture the carbon dioxide it emits

892322 over the years as bankers the lesson being learnt is that the voices of disadvantaged individuals or groups is very important and will in turn help them to set own priorities and better use to resources
892323 capacity building is when individuals groups societies and communities are equipped with the understanding skills and access to information knowledge and training that enables them to perform effectively
892324 empowerment strengthens communities increasing the capacity of individuals or groups to make choices and to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes

892359 the banking association the life offices association loa the south african insurance association and other financial trade associations yesterday boycotted negotiations on gazetting the financial sector charter
892360 these claims are untrue and a misrepresentation of facts the trade associations simply requested time to consult with their constituencies on the revised draft sector code the trade associations also expressed concern at the slow progress in the resolution of the ownership matter but certainly did not walk out of the meeting
892361 we said it doesnt make sense to continue the discussions on the rest of the charter without any report on the ownership issues we have agreed to align the rest of the charter with the codes but there is still a problem with ownership
892362 at no point did we walk out of the meeting or indicate that we were not willing to proceed we therefore disagree strongly with the way cosatu portrays events

892368 yes the judges received mercedes benz e280 this was long overdue and some of the judges had never been issued with mercedes benz vehicles ever since their appointment to the bench
892369 others were due for new allocation after five years each judge is entitled to a new mercedes benz after five years in terms of his or her conditions of service so the rbz intervened and funded the acquisition of the vehicles we are very happy that at long last the judges have been given their entitlement
892370 we have problems of power outages in the country and judges do not work in their chambers alone but carry their work home they need to write their judgments at home and during weekends

892423 i dont know what youre trying to cover up here but were not going to allow it
892424 the defense department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising dr whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena
892425 even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier and its a betrayal of the armys core values
892426 i believe that maria would be alive today if the marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault
892427 the victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command
892428 maria is dead but there will be many more victims in the future i promise you im here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve

892499 we try and get as many folks involved as possible
892500 fewer lobbyists can claim to have relationships with as many legislators as they once might have been able to claim
892501 so you have to find out ways to get someones attention on a bill that otherwise might not happen

892540 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
892541 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
892542 theyre so easily spooked the labor government have such a lack of confidence in themselves
892543 peter costello made clear that hes not available for the leadership and that remains the case he did that the day after the election
892544 he flagged he was thinking about the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family and im sure thats what hes doing
892545 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
892546 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
892547 he hasnt got blokes knocking on doors and if he has he has studiously avoided knocking on my door
892548 there were very few people making comment to me about peter costello and why he isnt making a decision
892549 if he wants to put his name forward for the leadership and launch a challenge theres a process for that if he does decide that he needs to let the partyroom know that and we will decide who the leader is

892602 i wasnt aware that it was happening on any large scale however taxi drivers are operating 24 hours a day and trying to generate business
892603 whats happening is that we are both competing for the business im all for a level playing field i dont want one side to have an advantage over the other
892604 it hasnt affected us in any way its all about the consistency of what were doing if youre a taxi driver youd have to be out there every day of the week doing that youd want to be committed

892620 i cant comment on the process that were going through i apologize for being so obtuse
892621 when we start commenting you really get on a slippery slope and sometimes thats unfair to the people that are under consideration
892622 i think particularly someone like barack obama who is such a controlling politician and works so hard to make sure that everything is leak proof i imagine he probably has led us completely astray and might have a really explosive surprise in store because thats the way he wants to be
892623 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes

892768 its one of those mountains where once youve climbed it you dont ever go back

892773 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
892774 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
892775 we do hope that this current government now will give full recognition to our service and give us full access to the veterans entitlement act

892777 the same sort of bureaucracy exists now that existed in the 1950s when the tests were going on in top secret

892816 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of cabinet and to the liberal party to make sure we have every opportunity to win government at that election

892820 i do not want to give the government the opportunity to take the focus off of its failings by engaging in cheap personality based politics
892821 i give an assurance today that whoever replaces me as leader of the parliamentary liberal party will have my 100 per cent support both on the record and off the record

892863 quando non pu lottare contro il vento e il mare per seguire la sua rotta il veliero ha due possibilit landatura di cappa che lo fa andare alla deriva e la fuga davanti alla tempesta con il mare in poppa e un minimo di tela la fuga spesso quando si lontani dalla costa il solo modo di salvare la barca ed equipaggio e in pi permette di scoprire rive sconosciute che spuntano allorizzonte delle acque tornate calme rive sconosciute che saranno per sempre ignorate da coloro che hanno lillusoria fortuna di poter seguire la rotta dei carghi e delle petroliere la rotta senza imprevisti imposta dalle compagnie di navigazione forse conoscete quella barca che si chiama desiderio
892864 per noi la causa prima dellangoscia limpossibilit di realizzare lazione gratificante e sottrarsi a una sofferenza con la fuga o la lotta anchesso un modo di gratificarsi quindi di sfuggire allangoscia

892908 but you always knew you would get to do good work and work on good buildings
892909 as far as tucson goes its a pretty big deal working at ua
892910 whenever a ua job comes up well get people calling wanting work because they want to lay brick there its kind of a notch in your trowel
892911 i brought my son to the ua job this summer just to ensure that five generations have been involved in bricklaying on campus
892912 but tommy and i have really pushed them to make a living with their brains and not their backs
892913 kurts got an academic scholarship here at ua and i tell him look youre squandering a hopeful future with your brains for what
892914 you get a sense of accomplishment ill see what college does for me but id also like to do the apprentice program with cox masonry because i kind of feel it would be a shame to see the trade die out with my generation there arent many bricklayers out there
892915 most everyone in the past 30 years is more of a concrete block mason than a brick mason
892916 really the only brick you see here is tusd and ua you get guys who say i can lay brick but if youve laid block all your life youre not going to be able to lay brick
892917 they can work during breaks but this is a hard job and it gets harder all the time
892918 with a brick manufacturer downtown it was accessible and attractive
892919 these were stories about men in my day men who would show up for work in a white shirt and tie and at the end of a day of laying brick would barely be dirty because they were just that good
892920 you grew up seeing them as the princes of the trades it is hard to explain but when youre a young kid working out there with some of these old guys laying brick just gets under your skin and its hard to let go
892921 beginning in the 40s and 50s they started inventing concrete block and construction moved to that because brick was more expensive we do about 4 million in business annually and 90 percent of it is concrete block
892922 there will be exceptions but theyre usually far from the historic core
892923 were committed to what made us special in the first place and that includes red bricks red roof tiles and open spaces that said we dont believe we have to do the whole building out of red bricks anymore because it is cost prohibitive we utilize red brick in areas where it is visible and we dont put it where it cant be seen buildings arent built the old way
892924 with the ica facility we wanted to be sure the visible sides to the campus and community had red brick but the south side faces the swimming complex which is made of different material and we wanted those buildings to blend together
892925 the continuing strength of the australian dollar has made it more difficult to maintain a competitive position for australian exports and has correspondingly made imports relatively cheaper

892933 thus there is a need to establish a funding allocation guide for the expenditure of rio nuevo tax increment dollars as the catalyst for change
892934 it complements the rest of the memorial which was more abstract and poetic not everybody is happy but i think the approach is a sound one

892960 there have been compartmentalised subplots in the other books that have made them easier to cut although those cuts were still to the horror of some fans

892968 the safety of the bridge was never in question and i am pleased this investigation has confirmed that
892969 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
892970 the mccain campaign will be represented by liz mair the online communications director of the republican national committee the obama campaign will be represented by mike nelson a professor at georgetown university who served in the clinton white house under vice president gore on tech policy issues he is an outside advisor to obamas campaign on issues of technology media and telecommunications
892971 mike liz and ana will be using their personal twitter accounts mikenelson lizmair and anamariecox and weve also asked them to tag their responses with the hashtag pdfdebate we suggest that readers who want to follow along use a twitter application like

892978 democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
892979 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on august 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
892980 today senator obama has requested that the credentials committee give florida and michigan delegates their full votes
892981 this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates

893018 ill have a better feel when we play somebody else as we go
893019 what i do like about them is their hustle theyre working on the details
893020 youre happy on one side and not on the other
893021 youd like to go down and score and at the same time not let them score when youre working against each other
893022 if you start preparing for an opponent too early your starters dont play too much
893023 if you get an eight man front you make it a seven man front when he comes out on a naked bootleg somebodys got to prepare for it now youre dealing in the run game with a potential seven man front
893024 thats all part of that you take a guy out of the box jon runs it really well you can hit those big guys williams and calvin johnson on crossers
893025 were just going to continue to make a physical investment in running it
893026 its not a distraction but it kind of gets to me like whats gonna happen
893027 its just a business man i heard there were offers for me so it must mean im pretty good i dont know the future i dont know if im gonna be here or not they can franchise me keep him for a lucrative one year contract and id be here for another year and then itd start all over again
893028 oh yeah anybody wants to stay where they got drafted
893029 and then when they get to the end of their career they want to go home i talk strongly about texas because im from there but i dont talk strongly about the cowboys or the texans i would love to stay here get to the playoffs here be part of history here
893030 im always optimistic but this year lets just see what happens
893031 its kind of taken its toll on me i do like the players and the attitude i cant put a finger on how many were gonna win or lose but ive always wanted to run the football to open us up on the outside
893032 im not worried about my numbers my four years have done my talking for me
893033 if i go by what the coaches say were gonna get our balls but we shall see we got a defensive minded coach a run game and a short efficient passing game we might be in 10 6 ballgames every week
893034 im the no 1 guy calvins good but ive got four years on him one day it will be calvin johnsons team but as long as no 11s here im no 1
893035 the running game is going to be a definite plus but our best players are still our wideouts so we have to get them the football
893036 if we run like we say were gonna it should present more opportunities for roy and calvin to be one on one
893037 any time you draft somebody as high as calvin johnson people think oh hes the no 1 guy theyre gonna get rid of whoever they have
893038 then they pay calvin around 30 million so you wonder whats roy gonna ask for
893039 it could be a million miles straight right or left
893040 some days i cant not make a bogey and some days i can put a string of pars together and some days its double bogeys my games from 80 to 90 and 80 to 95
893041 even though it was a practice round i thought it was pretty cool
893042 just watching those guys hit the ball its awesome how they hit a 7 iron 200 plus yards its amazing how they operate they had a lot of fun
893043 i know it was a practice round but it was still a lot of fun i was in awe being inside the ropes and walking with the groups what was memorable we had lunch with the caddies after the round those guys are pretty neat
893044 royal birkdale is a lot easier especially when i played than oakland hills
893045 i didnt have enough room to hit into the greens with how i hit the ball
893046 and the 18th hole that par 4 may be the most difficult hole for a major championship
893047 after i got done with the tournament i had a couple people say why did you wear red
893048 it was just the only clean shirt i had left
893049 you send everything to dry cleaning and i dont want to wear what i wore thursday friday saturday sunday the same combo that i wore at the british it happened to be the only clean shirt i had the last thing im thinking about is my shirt when im making bogeys
893050 the core of our american democracy is the right to vote implicit in that right is the notion that that vote be private that vote be secure and that vote be counted as it was intended when it was cast by the voter and i think what were encountering is a pivotal moment in our democracy where all of that is being called into question
893051 als de vrijheidslievende mensen in de wereld zich niet uitspreken tegen de chinese onderdrukking in china en tibet verliezen we alle morele autoriteit om ons uit te spreken over mensenrechten waar dan ook in de wereld
893052 we dringen er al jaren op aan dat china een dialoog voert met de dalai lama die tegen geweld is en opkomt voor de culturele autonomie van het tibetaanse volk maar heel duidelijk heeft gemaakt dat hij geen onafhankelijkheid nastreeft
893053 in that situation i had to believe he was trying to hit me even with the bases loaded
893054 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
893055 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
893056 im a man i take my consequences i know what i did i think i did the right thing
893057 hes improved so much his arm strength you know its not what it was before he first got hurt but it was pretty close
893058 we made him work a little bit there in the middle innings but we didnt take advantage of it that was really the difference for us
893059 thats a good start to having him back in the rotation
893060 aaah penawaran seperti ini terlalu banyak di internet dan itu semua hanya iming iming saja
893061 bagaimana saya yakin anda tidak akan merampok saya dengan memberikan mimpi sejenis ini
893062 and you didnt even acknowledge me stupid f ing blonde
893063 theyre in a lot of similar markets as we are
893064 the league is run and operated by arena football but at the same time it gets expensive to run an af2 football team
893065 the average budget in the uif and ifl in previous years has been somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 000 less than the af2
893066 so suddenly you have a similar game played by similar rules in similar sized communities similar sized buildings but were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars less every year to do so for long term stability thats very important
893067 theyre going to have to pick their poison of who they try to double
893068 all the pieces are in place for us to do good this season
893069 and thats why were putting in the work now and polishing up things and putting in plays so we can go out and perform and be one of the top defenses
893070 weve got guys in place that can definitely do it
893071 and were excited about what this year holds for us
893072 just because weve got a lot of talent and we work hard and thats going to be the biggest thing you cant just say we look good on paper were going to be good weve got to go out there every day and put our nose in the grass and weve got to hit the field with a purpose to get better
893073 people are putting that pressure on us so i dont feel like we have the pressure because were just playing ball trying to improve the things we need to and the outside influences are putting that pressure on us and if we just stick to our guns and play our football were going to be fine
893074 a child with a blood lead level at 10 20 micrograms dl may not exhibit any symptoms at all yet the lead may change brain development to cause lower iq scores or behavioral problems later in life at higher blood lead levels generally above 40 micrograms dl symptoms may include abdominal pain constipation loss of appetite agitation lethargy and even seizures
893075 from the start of the season to this point has been more than disappointing ive been shocked by our performance
893076 weve got too many guys not producing and im not talking about one or two guys but weve had some performances that have been terrible ive been disgusted the last few nights the last few weeks we had situations where we should have dominated a game and we didnt come close
893077 youve got to step it up if you want to be in the hunt if not go home and come back next spring training ill bring up some kids to play

893128 a la argentina le ha costado encontrar su rol en el mundo sostuvo ahora es como que el mundo nos dijo cu l es nuestro rol es producir alimentos
893129 result uno de los momentos m s emotivos de toda la programaci n de nuestro pa s
893130 un caso de tr fico de influencias y filtraci n de informaci n sensible que habr a servido de origen a la maniobra irregular
893131 este debate deber a profundizarse con el aumento de las retenciones a la miner a o con un gravamen a la renta financiera con una reforma tributaria profunda o la reducci n del iva a los productos de primera necesidad
893132 las democracias se enriquecen y potencian con las diferencias y a su vez tienen que ser el espacio y el l mite de la resoluci n de los conflictos
893133 el estado de sospecha y de inconveniente permanente no hace f cil la permanencia en un cargo por eso creo que puedo contribuir m s con mi renuncia que con mi permanencia en el cargo
893134 es imprescindible que quien es electo por la voluntad popular cumpla con el mandato constitucional
893135 la concertaci n plural tiene que continuar porque es necesario en el ejercicio de un gobierno seguir ensanchando la base de sustentaci n del poder pol tico
893136 sintieron el ruido del choque y cuando se dieron vuelta ya ten an el coche encima
893137 se salv de milagro porque se agach a levantar una moneda y el auto lo despidi y no lo arrastr como a sus amigos
893138 los autos que participaron del choque andaban a toda velocidad por la ruta sin medir que hab a gente caminando
893139 fue terrible cuando llegu al lugar del accidente los cuatro chicos estaban desparramados
893140 cuando un grupo de cinco personas con esqu es y snowboards y motos de nieve provocaron un desprendimiento en el filo de punta princesa
893141 uno de los esquiadores qued atrapado en la avalancha pero fue rescatado y lo derivaron a la cl nica san carlos
893142 est n bien y no fueron afectadas por el desprendimiento
893143 en el reglamento se aclara que cuando se esqu a fuera de las pista habilitadas las personas lo hacen por su cuenta y se hacen cargo de su seguridad
893144 fueron muchos asesinatos calculo que mis dos bloques asesinaron a 3000 personas o m s muchos se tiraron al r o cauca cantidades
893145 murieron m s inocentes que culpables pero as es la guerra
893146 matamos a mucha gente s lo por el hecho de que los se alaran como colaboradores o simpatizantes de las guerrillas izquierdistas
893147 fue ese a o la primera vez que mat a alguien
893148 decapitamos a muchas y se hizo como estrategia para promover el terror
893149 creo que la verdad s quedar mocha sin terminar de contar ya que como usted sabe una guerra tan larga y tan atroz no se cuenta en un mes o dos meses hay gente que dice que no se est contando la verdad
893150 yo transit libremente en una camioneta hilux blanca que llamaban camino al cielo y asesin bamos todos los d as en todos los municipios de urab la nica que denunciaba era la alcaldesa gloria cuartas

893155 hasta hace seis meses los grupos paramilitares estaban unidos pero hoy hay una divisi n a ra z de la extradici n a estados unidos cuando estaban en colombia los l deres lograron manejar todav a desde las c rceles los mandos medios de sus estructuras pero desde all no tienen nada qu hacer y ahora son esos mandos medios los que est n en una puja
893156 creo m s bien que son los hombres leales a macaco los que est n siendo exterminados
893157 en este momento hay una coyuntura cr tica los grupos armados ilegales dise aron una estrategia aprendida de las viejas tesis marxistas leninistas que consiste en la combinaci n de las formas de lucha los grupos reinsertados est n combinando la estrategia de lo pol tico y lo militar eso se traduce en que ellos hacen un trabajo social en las comunidades se insertan en organizaciones comunitarias deportivas barriales y toman el circuito econ mico del barrio y por otro lado tienen el control de lo militar manejan las bandas y grupos armados ilegales
893158 ese primer grupo es llamado emergente y son aquellos que nacieron donde hubo una desmovilizaci n un segundo grupo son los disidentes es decir quienes entraron al proceso de justicia y paz y se salieron otros son los rearmados o sea aquellos que entraron al proceso de desmovilizaci n y luego tomaron las armas de nuevo
893159 yo no tengo la legitimidad democr tica para decidir sobre el fondo de la cuesti n pero tengo el derecho de obligarte a que desde tu lugar decidas para no convertirnos en corresponsables de una violaci n de la constituci n
893160 por ahora no hay atisbos de poner en movimiento al peronismo pero yo creo que hay que darle movilidad salir a dar charlas hacer congresos ir a las provincias a hablar de pol tica
893161 si quiere encabezar l la movilizaci n del partido tanto mejor pero si no le vamos a pedir que nos autorice a hacer algunas cosas a nosotros
893162 le quiere dejar la escena limpia a cristina y si l empieza con la actividad plena aunque sea restringi ndose estrictamente al pj los medios van a ir detr s de l y eso no es conveniente
893163 hay un movimiento subterr neo en el peronismo que no es bueno pero tambi n lo hay en nuestros aliados que est n alertas a lo que suceda para ver si se van o se quedan como creo que es dif cil que podamos trabajar en los dos frentes a la vez yo elegir a tratar de contener a los transversales porque en el pj hoy por hoy hay menor riesgo de deserciones
893164 los que se fueron atr s de cobos no creo que vuelvan y los que se quedaron no se van a ir

893167 se abrir es decir se corregir antes de que empiece el debate parlamentario
893168 vamos a realizar algunas modificaciones al proyecto original para no perder el debate antes de darlo
893169 habr modificaciones en la redacci n de proyecto sobre todo en temas que hacen al origen presupuestario del dinero que se utilizar para el salvataje de aa esta discusi n tiene que ver con cu nta plata est involucrada y c mo har el estado para recuperar y reconstruir a la empresa
893170 nadie est dispuesto a firmar un cheque en blanco a ninguna secretar a
893171 mi voto no fue en contra del gobierno fue pensando en una soluci n al conflicto agropecuario el tema de aerol neas es diferente estamos hablando de un servicio p blico que afecta a todo el pa s desde la carga de pasajeros hasta la salud pude hablar con otros legisladores n de la r de los que tambi n votaron en contra de la resoluci n 125 aunque no quiso dar nombres y pensamos en este sentido no existe un grupo opositor y menos de traidores por eso no creo que tengamos mayores problemas durante la votaci n
893172 existe una cl usula que dice que todo juicio anterior a la llegada de marsans debe ser costeado por la sepi espa ola sociedad estatal de participaciones industriales estamos hablando de aproximadamente 70 millones de d lares esto es parte de lo que deberemos discutir y profundizar en el debate parlamentario
893173 antes presionaba la mesa de enlace ahora ser n los trabajadores
893174 si el estado hubiera decretado la quiebra la oposici n hubiese pedido la estatizaci n est n envalentonados y se opondr n a cualquier cosa
893175 esto va a terminar en un esc ndalo internacional marsans produjo un vaciamiento de la empresa en espa a hay un juicio que puede decretar que todo el paquete accionario que dice tener la compa a es falso tampoco est n claros los balances locales de aerol neas los que van desde 2002 al 2004 que fueron aprobados una vez que se fue roberto lavagna del gobierno
893176 el proyecto tal cual est goza de poca salud no s qu dir n los propios legisladores del oficialismo que votaron a favor de las retenciones m viles sobre este proyecto
893177 por qu vamos a hacernos cargo de una deuda de 250 millones de d lares para este a o si se puede crear otra empresa
893178 no creo que el estado deba involucrarse en la prestaci n de un servicio p blico incluso me parece que es necesaria una desregulaci n de las rutas a reas
893179 est de acuerdo con que el estado vuelva a controlar su l nea de bandera
893180 el proyecto plantea aprobar un acta acuerdo donde se dice que se pasar n las acciones de la compa a al estado pero no se fija cu nto ser m s all de que una vez establecido ese n mero volver a actuar el congreso es un proyecto complicado
893181 funcom will be exposed to volatility associated with foreign currency exchange rates the operational costs of funcom are to a large extent in nok
893182 computer games are used for entertainment and therefore the demand may decline during recession when disposable income decreases
893183 dependent on the continued and uninterrupted operation of the internet any adverse incident affecting the internet may affect funcoms ability to gain revenues
893184 if funcom does not manage to release their games at the planned dates the development budgets of the games may increase
893185 there is also a risk that competitors will gain a foothold in the market at the expense of funcom or that the games will be less competitive when launched
893186 rating agencies in the various markets may set the allowed age level to play the funcom games too high or too low and thereby potentially limit the addressable market
893187 the successful operation of an mmo depends on a large number of complicated hardware and software components that need to work successfully together
893188 any errors bugs or viruses may harm the operation of the mmo and thus have an adverse effect on funcoms ability to gain revenues
893189 the games funcom develops may not perform equally well on all pc configurations impacting sales negatively
893190 the commercial success of funcoms games is to a high degree dependent on consumer satisfaction there is a risk that the consumers will be unsatisfied with funcom products the support and the number of bugs and errors in the products
893191 funcoms future income is highly dependent on the success of the age of conan mmo in itself age of conan is expected to contribute with significant revenues and earnings and if age of conan attains low subscriber numbers there will be a negative impact on future cash flows and the valuation of funcom furthermore the game is intended to be one of the funding sources for the development of other titles and lower cash inflows than expected could also have an indirect effect in terms of reduced revenues earnings and cash flows from other games and the future funding requirements of the company

893202 his focus is different and hes not going to play football anymore hes just going to stress his academics and graduate in december we respect his decision we know its been a difficult one for him and one that he has thought a great deal about were disappointed to see him leave and wish him the best

893204 the seattle times company owns seven affiliate newspapers in washington state and maine a network of comprehensive online news information and advertising web sites and printing and distribution subsidiaries
893205 we already have the authority i think to strictly limit media consolidation problem is we have been under a relentless barrage of pressure from some of the largest media companies in america certainly companies that politicians here in washington pay a lot of attention to demanding that we relax the rules and give them the ability to buy more and more outlets additional legislation would always be helpful but right now part of the big challenge is to make sure we dont make the situation get any worse

893238 la disponibilidad de las terapias es una realidad en la argentina pero si viv s en situaci n de pobreza a 20 kil metros del hospital y el d a que fuiste hab a paro y no te atendieron a la semana siguiente el dinero que ten as para viajar lo gastaste para darles de comer a tus hijos y te quedaste sin los medicamentos esto sucede diariamente
893239 los ltimos datos indican que ha crecido notablemente la infecci n en las mujeres j venes y de estratos socioecon micos medios y bajos y en la totalidad de los casos se percibe un aumento de la incidencia en la poblaci n heterosexual
893240 en algunos hospitales se reh san a atender a personas con vih en catamarca puntualmente ha sucedido que no las trasladan a terapia intensiva las dejan sin ninguna atenci n y finalmente mueren otro problema es que est concentrada la atenci n en las capitales y la gente que vive en el interior tiene que trasladarse para recibir atenci n y medicamentos
893241 a veces no tienen dinero para llevar los medicamentos que env a la naci n a hospitales y centros sanitarios y se ha superado el problema porque los mismos beneficiarios han puesto su veh culo para trasladarlos eso es terrible
893242 requieren distintos tratamientos para contrarrestar los efectos adversos de los medicamentos y a veces tambi n faltan
893243 tomar los antirretrovirales no es como tomar una aspirina necesitamos una buena alimentaci n se estima que la mitad de las personas con vih en argentina son pobres muchos estaban recibiendo en la provincia de buenos aires un bols n con comida a trav s de desarrollo social pero hace casi un a o no se los entregan m s
893244 renovar nuestro compromiso de cristianos para que honrando la sangre derramada de nuestros m rtires nos volvamos a sumar fraterna y sencillamente a la lucha por la vida de todo el hombre y con todos los hombres
893245 a nosotros como neuquinos esta memoria de la vida nos encuentra en un momento muy importante
893246 estamos para asistir a un acto de justicia que esperamos ponga remedio a tantos a os de impunidad de aparente triunfo de muerte el juicio penal a algunos responsables de los aberrantes delitos de lesa humanidad cometidos en nuestra zona
893247 que desde la fe cristiana comprometidos con el evangelio de la vida entregaron la propia para que nuestro pueblo tuviera vida y la tuviera en abundancia
893248 las dictaduras de muerte fueron tr gicamente simult neas en toda nuestra am rica latina
893249 angelelli fue perseguido y le cost l grimas y esfuerzos predicar el evangelio
893250 qu har an cientos de familias italianas que dependen de las ni eras filipinas peruanas y bolivianas o los miles de ancianos que sobreviven gracias a las badanti cuidadoras que los atienden
893251 a la hora de estructurar la realidad de los hechos medios que gestan la distorsi n de lo que ocurre difunden el prejuicio y el racismo m s silvestre y espont neo sin la responsabilidad por explicar por informar adecuadamente ni por reflexionar con ponderaci n las mismas circunstancias conflictivas y cr ticas sobre las que operan
893252 por una raz n de estricta justicia no parece razonable y enoja que mientras otros ingresos est n alcanzados tal como sucede con los del trabajo personal la renta financiera permanezca indemne
893253 por qu en nuestro pa s la renta financiera no est gravada
893254 el problema no es que no est gravada sino c mo est gravada
893255 los chetniks se llevaron a mis tres hermanos y s que no volver a verlos vivos
893256 son unos cobardes que s lo valen para vigilarnos no para defendernos
893257 ech por la borda toda nuestra pol tica y no puso nada en su lugar
893258 el problema que tuvimos con el congreso partidario de los conservadores no es que fue brillante sino que el nuestro fue pat tico por eso a los tories les bast con decir algo concreto para que pareciera que ten an una plataforma pol tica de sustancia
893259 el laborismo tiene que escalar una monta a para ganar la pr xima elecci n y sin embargo lo nico que tenemos es una multitud de mini iniciativas que no sirven para nada tenemos que ser ambiciosos y audaces para cambiar los t rminos del debate p blico
893260 me reconoc a cada segundo a cada an cdota a cada mirada
893261 a m me dijeron que me iba a atender el presidente

893263 mir nene si vos est s en esta oficina es porque el presidente quiso que se te d una mano y ac se te van a solucionar tus problemas

893346 it is in mexico that the most significant fire opal deposits in the world lie
893347 fire opals are either faceted that is as far as their transparency allows or cut as a cabochon since this is the shape which best brings out the rich glow of this orange jewel it is the oval which is regarded as the classical shape for valuable fire opals brazilian raw stones however are also cut into many other imaginative shapes their sheer size giving cutters and gemstone designers almost unlimited freedom for both work and play
893348 the tolerance of the fire opal to extreme heat is just as poor as its resistance to acids alkaline solutions and sharp objects very unfavourable conditions compel the opal to surrender its moisture which can make it cloudy and cracked like all opals it should not be exposed to intense light over long periods however it loves to be worn a lot since this enables it to maintain its water balance using the moisture of the wearers skin and that of the air having said that it should be protected against contact with cosmetics fire opals which have become matt through being worn a great deal can be repolished
893349 in roman times the gem was carried as a good luck charm or talisman as it was believed that the gem like the rainbow brought its owner good fortune
893350 in ancient times opal was considered to be very lucky a talisman for protecting against disease for producing wealth for any number of ills and problems how much it was valued by previous civilisations this was even before the quality gem fields of australian opal were discovered

893362 you dont necessarily have to be actively telling them what to do all the time but if you sit there and watch youll notice mistakes and you can do mini lessons as youre sitting there
893363 the perception among the american public and even among lawmakers is that the people who are being deported are maniacal homicidal and rapist criminals

893381 but were not the ones in the classroom instructing those kids

893383 without school resource officers on some of the districts most challenging campuses the safety and welfare of students staff and community members is a significant concern

893391 the court of appeals ruling ensures this defendant will receive the mandatory sentence the law provides for his misconduct the legislature has established mandatory sentences for criminals to make sure they receive proper punishment it is important that these sentences be carried out and upheld by our courts
893392 we therefore reverse the trial courts orders continuing botkin on standard probation and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with his opinion
893393 a petition to revoke botkins intensive probation was promptly filed alleging the felony offense the trial court eventually found that the additional felony was committed
893394 the trial court revoke the defendants probation and impose terms of imprisonment for the 2000 offense
893395 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering

893504 i keep praying and asking god why they took our church
893505 the local church was an accredited church of the denomination and agreed to be bound by the denominations constitution and rules
893506 we had the right to convey our property away or purchase new property without any consent from the c amp ma denomination
893507 they downgraded the church solely to obtain title to the property so they could sell it and use the money for other ministries
893508 we conduct services in at least 32 languages you dont do that without understanding the complexity of working with people who have english as a second language

893519 there was a connection between the events of september 11 2001 and iraq
893520 let me just first tell you that ive never been more convinced that the decisions i made are the right decisions
893521 if it was anyone else wed be stringing them up by their neck but no its bobby dee and the folk process
893522 who cares what you think punk you dont even have a name
893523 this is an issue of having community leaders come to an agreement
893524 was inspired by partisan divisions inside the broadcasting board of governors
893525 to resist economic pressures to make additional cuts which could remove it from the top ranks of american journalism
893526 but as a community voice in the metropolitan region the los angeles times is irreplaceable
893527 so good to see you ive heard about your good news congratulations

893534 between them theyve put out something like a hundred books and in all those years of chatter all those forests laid to waste neither of them has been able to come up with one lifelike woman character
893535 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
893536 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive
893537 maybe i can get you on charlies show you and one of the patriarchs
893538 in an even more dire situation than the active army but both have the same symptoms i just have a higher fever

893550 with respect to software the term interoperability is used to describe the capability of different programs to exchange data via a common set of exchange formats to read and write the same file formats and to use the same protocols
893551 your data should be as close to your main programming environment as it is possible
893552 there are no such tools for key value data stores because these products are so new
893553 those guys do scale relational database so they are scalable
893554 why not wait and address super scalability once youve created a super product
893555 amazon simpledb apache couchdb and the google datastore api arent bad products but we do them a disservice when we construe them to be replacements for general purpose databases used carefully they can help your organization but used indiscriminately youll create a lot more work for your programmers and youll make your application perform even worse
893556 las primeras estimaciones del sistema del cdc revelan que la epidemia de vih es y ha sido peor de lo que se conoce previamente los resultados indican que aproximadamente 56 300 nuevas infecciones por vih se produjeron en 2006 en estados unidos
893557 esta cifra es casi un 40 m s alta que las anteriores estimaciones del cdc de 40 000 infecciones por a o que estaban basadas en informaciones m s limitadas y m todos menos precisos
893558 los datos confirman que hay un fuerte impacto de esta epidemia entre los hombres gays y bisexuales de estados unidos as como entre los hombres y mujeres negros
893559 it is essential for us to unburden ourselves from the perceptions that have shadowed your outstanding work
893560 we dont flash badges or look for extra perks were not what the media puts across
893561 were respectable people who want to give back to the community
893562 the extra eyes and ears make it probably the safest airport in the country
893563 this undeserved stigma is rooted in the programs past and is no longer accurate however the badges which have become a lightning rod for criticism and mistrust are its most visible legacy and serve to undermine your service and tarnish the reputation of the program
893564 he wanted to put it all in a building where everybody could see
893565 frank had said a couple of times to me i really think dougs trying to kill me
893566 that my actions contributed to his death but i loved frank craig very much
893567 that because you have done this and have not withheld your son your only son i will surely bless you
893568 and youre going to guide him and bring him home safe
893569 as of right now all of those possibilities are on the table
893570 until we can verify anything it has to be looked at in a homicide of this kind with a person whos from a neighborhood thats had some difficulty with gangs you cant rule anything out particularly that
893571 its a very sober situation were a family he had two families he was a great family man and he had a family here just like his family is grieving him so are we
893572 he was this close to moving out of that neighborhood
893573 and getting into for him his dream home it would be his first home were talking weeks away he was so happy everything was going well now are they going to have that dream home in a matter of seconds everything was taken away from him
893574 he was the cream of the crop and thats what really hurts
893575 youve got three kids that are going to have to grow up without a dad
893576 he was close to everybody he was one of those outstanding guys that there wasnt a person in the jail that could say anything bad about him he was a good fair man an outstanding deputy he was fair with the inmates but firm if i gave him orders to do something he was saying yes sir before i could finish it
893577 we always try to be prepared for everything but one thing we cannot be prepared for is when you lose somebody
893578 and through all of it you have to stay professional and do your job but you know were all human in some aspects we have to be more than human you still have to come in the next day and do your job and a part of you has been torn away
893579 you never talk about your family where you live your hobbies
893580 they know where you work they could just post up on the driveway and wait for you to leave
893581 the individual market really is the worst place to buy insurance
893582 people cant band together to take advantage of greater bargaining power in groups and as a result of that they pay more to get less
893583 by limiting product flexibility wed also be limiting the affordability and access to coverage
893584 it is quite difficult to understand all the provisions limitations and features of policies
893585 we need to make the insurance market more user friendly
893586 everybody dances around the fire they throw stuff at us we throw stuff at them everybody falls over dead and we start all over again
893587 have either forgotten the steps to the dance of death or theyre too scared to move
893588 theres nothing precise about what goes on with any of these budget processes theres no plan whatever occurs to people is what they do
893589 when you experience poverty so close to so much wealth it makes it hard to put wealth on top of the list
893590 you realize how lucky you are by accident of birth
893591 i saw a lot in front of me all the time

893593 thumbs up means you need to surface fore finger to thumb means youre okay and this this means train
893594 its not so much learning as freestyle jam making chaos
893595 to me fallen fruit is the idea of identifying resources which are already there but you didnt know you had them
893596 inevitably everyones got a personal narrative attached to fruit those when i was a kid stories
893597 what i like most is that this gets people in l a together who would normally never talk thats the goal more than the jam interaction
893598 we get bikers from the valley foodies from the westside organic granola types from echo park curiosity seekers from orange county its a great mix
893599 these initiatives are examples of people frustrated with the consequences and trade offs forced by economic prosperity
893600 gives local governments no real discretion over their revenues except through land use planning toward commercial sales tax generating development
893601 it has really distorted planning for community building jobs and livability
893602 developers and their friends at city hall want you to believe that runaway commercial development is good for our city
893603 big developers make huge profits in our city while residents get stuck with and pay for the huge traffic mess they create
893604 rift is so full of loopholes that the damage it will do to the city will be felt for years to come
893605 we had long long rallies and they took a toll on both of us
893606 but i took some confidence from the win i had over richard gasquet at wimbledon and this will give me more
893607 its difficult when you play against an opponent who plays a slower game

893611 is there a national marketing strategy for singapores public library services
893612 it takes the research analysis and creative thought and identifies a practical programme of activity that will deliver against the marketing objectives

893614 but if spf starts a blog wouldnt that open up the pandoras box i e receiving tons of comments about say the mas salamat issue

893617 but wouldnt the police force blog get criticised for censoring my views if so why start a blog in the first place
893618 the intensity in which we interact with users will determine the success of libraries
893619 yes ive heard about the vuestar patent case but i dont think it applies to me

893628 readers and users will also be invited into an online community where they can work and publish at britannicas site under their own names interested users will be able to prepare articles essays and multimedia presentations on subjects in which theyre interested britannica will help them with research and publishing tools and by allowing them to easily use text and non text material from encyclopaedia britannica in their work we will publish the final products on our site for the benefit of all readers with all due attribution and credit to the people who created them the authors will have the option of collaborating with others on their work but each author will retain control of his or her own work
893629 as part of our longstanding tradition engaging a prominent community of scholars will continue to be a key requirement with this new site and initiatives we will be able to recruit new members beyond our current contributor base through recommendations from existing contributors applications from expert communities and by inviting select members of our user community
893630 though a number of people see this as an effort to compete with wikipedia in many ways its the opposite of the wiki model in that everyone gets personal credit for his or her own contributions and you control the future of the work you publish on the site
893631 in order to maximize the efficiency of our operations we have been developing initiatives to enhance the exploitation of economies of scale these include the use of longer trains in our railroads with 330 wagons and higher efficiency locomotives with on board computers and higher axle loads and the creation of a dedicated maritime shuttle service between brazil and asia where we expect most of the future growth of the global demand for iron ore to come from

893641 although we have been in discussion with our partners in margate and the kzn region about a multi year agreement it remains an annual decision
893642 the loeries committee will review this years awards and a decision will be announced about 2009 in september 2008
893643 after four years in margate our team and the local community have learnt what to expect allowing us to improve on services all round
893644 obviously there are pros and cons to each venue margate offers us a small town atmosphere with plenty of affordable accommodation and services all within walking distance of the venue its also fantastic for joburgers and capetonians to get away from the miserable winter weather and enjoy the wonderful tropical climate of the south coast
893645 the two main difficulties we face are that durban international airport is moving further north increasing travel time to margate and that there is no permanent venue in the town for the awards ceremony
893646 there are very few venues large enough to accommodate us and certainly none outside of the major centres moving to a larger city would certainly mean losing the intimacy of margate and the cannes type environment

893658 this will be the last time i can do anything alone with mu husband for awhile
893659 and this year it is going to be a good one therefore we are going to throw a party
893660 we dont really know all that many people except for olivers boat cleaning friends from last summer that is
893661 ollie you can move the furniture around and put away anything that might break oh and take care of the whole food situation
893662 we should keep the party small but not too small it does have to be memorable
893663 we tell a couple of boys and they tell a few people and soon the word just gets out

893672 yeah right breaking up fights and watching the house get trashed oh and rescuing you
893673 yes even though it was still fun and we havent had fun together in a long time
893674 did you forget that we have our own private beach
893675 maybe we like the pain maybe were wired that way because without it i dont know maybe we just wouldnt feel real whats that saying why do i keep hitting myself with a hammer because it feels so good when i stop

893677 upward pressures on prices are unlikely to abate until 2010 when infrastructure constraints are overcome
893678 a very 120 t nominal by 2013 which bmo calculates is the long term marginal cost of production and level needed to generate the supply of seaborne coal to balance the physical market
893679 furthermore because north american exports are expected to be nearly flat over this time horizon australian chinese indian and russian producers must step up production significantly as such the seaborne segment should continue to be the price setter for the met coal market
893680 a nuclear renaissance is at our door step and primary uranium production is well behind global demand and an increase in primary uranium is needed to feed tomorrows needs
893681 moreover the developing world is increasing demand for base metals via infrastructure development demand for vanadium used in steel products is increasing beyond primary production thus given these fundamentals there is long term stability for uranium and vanadium prices
893682 energy fuels is entering production at a key stage to maximize the advantage of concurrent global growth in energy demand and the rapid industrialization urbanization of the developing world
893683 industrialization and urbanization throughout the undeveloped world has lead to increases in demand for and price of steel additives such as vanadium concurrent growth in energy demand and commensurate concern on minimizing atmospheric emissions has led to a nuclear renaissance and the increase in uranium demand has created the long term appreciation in the uranium price
893684 there are few operations in the world that mine and extract uranium and vanadium and as such energy fuels plans to mine construct and operate the pi on ridge mill in colorado will take advantage of this rare market synergy
893685 such action provides exposure to two sectors with robust underlying demand fundamentals and thus this gives sustained metal price stability that further enhances resource value and diversifies risk
893686 energy fuels will recommence mining first at the whirlwind and energy queen mines that largely have their infrastructure in place and resources outlined which streamlines avenues to production
893687 the small scale deposits in the uravan mineral belt offer unique exposure to production of uranium with an appreciable vanadium credit

893711 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering

893714 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life

893724 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools

893733 the snellen tool will point to children who cant read the blackboard but there are many other things that it wont pick up
893734 behavior problems arise and some kids withdraw socially others are misdiagnosed with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder
893735 we are pleased that jonas mwano has chosen to contribute his considerable geological acumen and experience exploring tanzanias mineral resources for the benefit of vipr industries we believe his expertise will prove to be invaluable as we explore our singida gold property and itigi manyoni uranium property and evaluate additional acquisitions in the area
893736 in the second quarter of 2008 our revenues grew at a rate that is reflective of the current economic environment with consumers purchasing power under pressure in this context we have been increasingly focusing on our price position we are fortunate to have our most powerful private label offering ever giving our customers high quality alternatives at great prices we are committed to fund price investments and offset underlying cost pressures through major savings initiatives that will have a lasting effect on our organization we continue to focus on our long term strategies which will make us even stronger when we emerge from this challenging economy
893737 in addition to our successful 2008 first half drilling programme we were delighted in june to receive strong institutional support for a further fund raising of pounds sterling 11 5 million which enables us to fully execute our planned 2008 drilling programme our focus on regional knowledge and 3d seismic data is proving to be successful and given our current momentum and recent capital infusion we intend to build upon these successes with ten additional wells scheduled to commence drilling before the end of 2008

893741 the book was brought back to the queen and the miracle related to her and she gave thanks to christ and from then on the queen loved the book even more than she had before
893742 we showed the worth of our team and drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital
893743 felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed at what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end
893744 he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory
893745 we now have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part
893746 we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as prepared as possible for the european grand prix
893747 it was a near perfect race one of my best but its one of the most frustrating races in my career
893748 as you saw everything was perfect then you know what happened and it did so without warning without the slightest indication
893749 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport but these things can happen
893750 now we must not give up but instead react quickly because there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground

893758 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
893759 and one of the challenges moving forward is to expand and bring in more talent people from other campaigns and other places and still maintain that culture we began with i think its happening but its a process and it fights the normal physics of national politics
893760 specifically sought out people who are going to play by those rules
893761 i dont know that wed get t shirts made that say it but we take pride in not leaking we take pride in not being a typical campaign
893762 when all the layers got peeled back they were actually leaking
893763 there is a feeling now that were going to win this thing and people are starting to talk about who is going to be what a few months from now
893764 the small team atmosphere has changed and that has caused some frictions on the inside
893765 based on the way were all sitting you cant tell where everybody fits in the hierarchy and thats a good thing
893766 im convinced that the korean government is doing everything it can to progress this transaction
893767 we will submit a revised application to fsc financial services commission as soon as practicable
893768 my knowledge is that hsbc board could not decide whether to extend the deal because the price renegotiation has not finished
893769 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
893770 i just thought to myself all of a sudden that we had something in common
893771 ternyata sungguh megah dan indah kampung halaman tempat tinggal bupati
893772 inilah rumah bupati itu mungkin pak bupati sedang menjamu para tetamu yang memilihnya alangkah baik hatinya bupati terpilih ini
893773 bupati baru ini benar benar seorang yang bisa menepati janjinnya janji untuk sekolah gratis benar benar diwujudkannya buktinya aku sudah dikasih seragam soalnnya dua anak tetangga aku juga kalau pergi sekolah ke kota bajunya selalu seragam dan ternyata sekolah itu enak hanya pake baju seragam pagi pagi disuruh berjemur dan dikurung dalam ruangan pantesan anak anak sekolah selalu bersih dan rapi tidak seperti aku yang blepotan lumpur dan getah rumput aku harus benar benar mengikuti dengan baik sekolah ini
893774 wah akhirnya aku benar benar dipertemukan dengan bapak bupati yang baik hati ini
893775 sungguh hebat bapak bupati ini waktu kampanye akan membuka lapangan kerja seluas luasnya ternyata ia tepati juga
893776 semua hal kan ada aturannya pelan pelan kita urusin bersama
893777 so yeah i take it personally but its not the first time and it probably wont be the last time
893778 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight i know if they do open up the competition not a lot of people will give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and coach will decide from there
893779 the production wasnt there whether it was on the front or the back end of the pass play
893780 its nice to stand up here and say when the offence scores four touchdowns in the scrimmage boy we feel good about it then you watch the film and it goes both ways its never as good as you think it is and its usually not as bad as you think it is ill just say this its quality film
893781 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback im not going to take any direction weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation well have monday but we have all the confidence in the world in aaron i think hes a player thats on time hes earned this opportunity three years preparing for it and ive very comfortable with him as our starting quarterback
893782 i think the organization has been put in a tough spot
893783 its a difficult situation when brett decided to change his mind but were going to welcome him back to the team ive got an opportunity if i dont win the competition then ill support brett and well move forward together
893784 if favre comes back aaron is going to be hot
893785 theres no point in extending my contract until i play
893786 its interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
893787 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
893788 but the combination of internal politics and media generalisation created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality

893799 we obviously transformed from a classical choir to rock choir but there was no pretence here it was a real transformation interestingly this has fed back into the choirs classical style they are certainly freer in approach and embody the music more a great result
893800 with the prize money we hope to establish and sustain a complete range of choral activities through the conservatorium for people of all ages and walks of life including the disadvantaged we hope to increase awareness of the enormous benefits of being in a choir not only for the singing of course but for social and health reasons as well
893801 i actually dunked my paint brush in my coffee the other day
893802 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
893803 i guess i should have asked why are you throwing starfish in the ocean
893804 the sun is up and the tide is going out and if i dont throw them in theyll die
893805 but young man dont you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it you cant possibly make a difference
893806 when the bible talks the best things that we can find the bible does not talking about what we dont have in spite god ask what do we have it may be simple things such as a dollar in your pockets an hour of your saturday a simple action of giving what the best you can find just bring it to jesus and ask him to bless it so the simple things yet the best things you had can be an answered for your prayer
893807 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god

893810 are you just trying to stir up some conversation or is your imagination and paranoia really what it appears to be id like to encourage you to let go of your apparent hostility and look for truth i admit that some of what you claim might be true but the hostile tone will cause more harm than good you start to look a lot like the person youre railing against if you really want to help you might want to look for a new more civil method just a suggestion
893811 this is a deserted place and it is now a late hour send them away so that they may go to the surrounding fields and villages and buy loaves for themselves
893812 shall we go and buy two hundred denarii of loaves and give them to eat
893813 god what do you mean by we have to give them food to eat when your disciples see famine in his neighborhood and ask for your interference
893814 answer jesus prefer to give another question that his disciples which includes you and i have to answer how many loaves do you have go and see
893815 answer jesus will ask the same questions to his disciples
893816 tuhan aku ini lulusan sarjana ekonomi apa yang bisa aku lakukan untuk mereka
893817 tuhan tidak memberikan sembarangan kerinduan dalam hati seseorang jika tuhan berikan itu dalam hati kamu mungkin sekali kamu memang terpanggil untuk itu sekarang coba pikirkan langkah apa yang harus kamu ambil supaya bisa melangkah minimal untuk mempersiapkan diri
893818 dulu kamu yang minta pada ku tentang hal ini lalu sekarang kamu mau menolaknya jadi kamu maunya apa
893819 a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
893820 it is an overdiagnosed medical condition in my readings there is no definitive medical diagnosis for autism
893821 they dont have a father around to tell them dont act like a moron
893822 among the other admonitions he felt children with autism should be hearing he said were
893823 we understand that radio hosts pick on any number of targets
893824 his recent comments about autistic children to be both inappropriate and insensitive
893825 he characterizes children with autism who are very very ill disabled children as essentially bad kids the only thing wrong with them is they have parents who dont discipline them
893826 that completely misrepresents what is going on with children with autism
893827 basically what hes doing is parroting what used to be said about autism 40 years ago back in the heyday of freudian analysis
893828 it was blamed on bad parenting there wasnt a shred of evidence to support that
893829 the views expressed by michael savage are his views and are not those of wor radio we regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners
893830 any tendency to blame the children or to think theyre just being bratty if they misbehave perpetuates the myth that autism isnt a learning disability
893831 its a neurobiological condition just like epilepsy or another medical condition like diabetes or a heart condition it would be like blaming the child with a heart condition for not being able to exercise
893832 they are hard workers tell them to jump off a bridge and they will do it without question
893833 its going to take a while because its really hard to do
893834 this is what i call a little footnote to the skywalker saga
893835 it is about the lower levels of life the lower depths
893836 they hear about the fact it is no longer a republic and now its an empire but they are from a world where none of that really means too much to them
893837 them moonbats terrified me out of my pants i cant believe the hotel didnt take action how can yoyu moonbats be nice to the m
893838 the willingness of perverts to release their flagella into hotel pools
893839 what concerns me is how they are essentially getting off scot free for their sins
893840 believe me thats hardly the worst thing that gets in a hotel pool
893841 i dont know if you realize this yet but christianity doesnt rule the world anymore since science came along and showed people the truth you guys have lost most of your power
893842 to determine the proper biblical punishment we need more information
893843 if there are two fornicators in your private pool assuming you have one youre going to want to punish them with more than a simple
893844 as for your offensive statement on christianity think before you speak
893845 we control the classrooms now the people of texas overwhelmingly support our efforts
893846 shoot them castrating mutilating them is just going to encourage them to become trannies and branding as on their chest isnt going to stop them from doing it most americans dont even know who hawthorne is the deceitful liberals here will also try to increase the scenarios of couples fornicating in pools where 13 year old girls swim thus increasing the amount of teenage pregancies rape cases and democrats
893847 actually i probably would let them off with a warning the first time anyway
893848 that article seems to indicate that you are losing that battle pretty badly too
893849 yet you still cant get creationist science to be taught on a state wide scale excuse me whilst i chuckle at your pseudo science
893850 so he boasts on the internet typing on a computer sitting in a house with all the modern comforts no doubt taking or have taken some form of medicine at some point in his life if science is a fraud then we live in a fantasy world free your mind bob
893851 hey maybe you all should check out my resent post on creationism that will get all your brains ticking my brain hurts already from reading all this but technology and science is great but evil at the same time it is a love hate relationship
893852 these techonological inventions are the results of divinely inspired guesswork
893853 for example science labels electrons with a negative label while giving protons a positive one yet upon further inspection we can see that the electrons are the real hard workers energizing things and spreading the gospel while the slothful protons sit idly in the center sheltering the morally timid neutrons at the final judgement all protons and neutrons will be cast into the lake of fire
893854 so why dont you want them to be punished in a hotel pool
893855 thank you but back to the fornicators if you shoot two you have to shoot all of them and then the rapists and child molesters and everyone in that category because shooting two people will surely not stop the rest of america
893856 if a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed and seizes her and lies with her and they are found then the man who lay with her shall give to the father fifty skelels of silver and she shall be his wife and he may not put her away all of his days deuteronomy 22 28 29
893857 if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so thou shalt put away evil from among you
893858 if scientists discover things through divine inspiration that means god favors them doesnt it
893859 why would the nature of their charge reflect on us electrical charges are not comparable to morality subatomic particles are not sentient you are just an idiot who makes up his own science because he cant understand real science
893860 and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye
893861 i never said they shouldnt be punished i just didnt agree with your suggestions
893862 theres another link between tattoos and the economic slump tattoos are especially popular among sodomites and sodomitesses who as we all know are siphoning off a huge proportion of the economy to fund their ever growing array of special privileges
893863 tattoos seem to have an even worse effect on the economy than firebreathing does who knew that tattoos are actually code for where abortion doctors should rip open the womb or that tattoos of dragons are invariably gang signs
893864 keeps trying to get away he keeps trying to go
893865 looks like the homeless bloke cost the taxpayers for money in hospital bills that he could never hope to pay you sure running people over is the best plan looks like it might do more harm than good
893866 im really quite disappointed in novak if you ask me he wasnt man enough to finish the job
893867 if that was the case money for embalming and burial cremation
893868 still far outweighs the cost of letting the guy live unharmed
893869 so he will doubtlessly protect my right to kill anyone that opposes his third term
893870 elephant bones just further proves the point that liberals dont know when to have fun and when to stare solidly at a wall guiltily president bush has made it clear that he cares more for my rights than some homeless hippie off of the streets so he will doubtlessly protect my right to kill anyone that opposes his third term
893871 in charge of sensitive files and closely linked to the syrian top brass
893872 it was a muslim worlds handshake with the jewish world
893873 i can say decisively that arik sharon never saw anyone as his heir
893874 he thought he would live until age 120 he respected and valued tzipi but not more than that
893875 arik never talked about an heir he liked her he took her under his wings she did her job as a minister under sharon but he didnt have expectations from her and he certainly did not see her as an heir
893876 arik trusted mofaz at least until he didnt immediately leave the likud for kadima when the new party was formed
893877 sharon appointed her as a minister and he thought she made a good justice minister maybe foreign minister but certainly not more than that
893878 he used people like olmert and tzipi politically but that doesnt make them his heirs if the ranch forum decides next time that sharons heir is immigrant absorption minister eli aflalo does that make it right if sharon would hear livni presented as his heir im sure he would laugh
893879 im highly confused as to why mr meehan is wearing a number 24 hat since the south has made it clear that they hate jeff gordon and prefer dale earnhardt ixion do you think that he is honoring the television show 24
893880 why do dumbocraps waant to attack rich people and support homos and muslims that makes no sense tpoo me
893881 a man far surpassing both the previous and future generations
893882 he who learns but does not think is lost he who thinks but does not learn is in great danger
893883 the book of genesis the book of beginnings where the origins of all things are to be found

893953 cool i hadnt thought of using yield return that way
893954 msnbc described mccaffrey as skeptic on the war as early as 2003
893955 the morale fighting effectiveness and confidence of u s combat forces continue to be simply awe inspiring in every sensing session and interaction i probed for weakness and found courage belief in the mission enormous confidence in their sergeants and company grade officers an understanding of the larger mission a commitment to creating an effective iraqi army and police unabashed patriotism and a sense of humor all of these soldiers ncos and young officers were volunteers for combat many were on their second combat tour several were on the third or fourth combat tour many had re enlisted to stay with their unit on its return to a second iraq deployment many planned to re enlist regardless of how long the war went on
893956 the foreign jihadist fighters have been defeated as a strategic and operational threat to the creation of an iraqi government aggressive small unit combat action by coalition forces combined with good intelligence backed up by new iraqi security forces is making an impact the foreign fighters remain a serious tactical menace however they are a minor threat to the heavily armed and wary u s forces they cannot successfully stop the iraqi police and army recruitment
893957 in closing mccaffrey said the iraqi political system is fragile but beginning to play a serious role in the debate over the big challenges facing the iraqi state oil religion territory power separatism and revenge the neighboring states have refrained from tipping iraq into open civil war the un is cautiously thinking about re entry and doing their job of helping consolidate peace the iraqis are going to hold saddam and his senior leadership accountable for their murderous behavior over 35 years the brave brits continue to support us both politically and militarily nato is a possible modest support to our efforts there is no reason why the u s cannot achieve our objectives in iraq our aim must be to create a viable federal state under the rule of law which does not enslave its own people threaten its neighbors or produce weapons of mass destruction this is a ten year task we should be able to draw down most of our combat forces in 3 5 years we have few alternatives to the current us strategy which is painfully but gradually succeeding this is now a race against time do we have the political will do we have the military power will we spend the resources required to achieve our aims it was very encouraging for me to see the progress achieved in the past year thanks to the leadership and personal sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of men and women of the centcom team and the cia the american people are far safer today than we were in the 18 months following the initial intervention
893958 lets talk with mr rosen about how he has personaly witnesses the successes of the elections the forming of the first popular govt in the history of iraq of the first mixed sunni shia govt in the entire history of islam of the almost complete defeat and discrediting of al qaeda and the insurgency and how these same successes can be used to defeat the threat of civil war
893959 this has all been a disaster so i am sure that the producers who work on the shows beleive the same thing so why should we exect anything different
893960 too biased maintain its audience yet had to remain unbiased enough to maintain its credibility
893961 a driving force in this years early success guard leaders say is that thousands of guard members have now returned from iraq and are reaching out to friends old classmates and co workers widening the face to face contacts that officials say are critical to recruiting
893962 are staying with us and want to fill up units with their neighbors and friends
893963 broken by the war the foriegn terrorists and local insurgents have been beaten
893964 there is no reason why the u s cannot achieve our objectives
893965 degraded to reporting based on secondary sources press briefings which they do not believe and alarmist video of the aftermath of suicide bombings obtained from iraqi employees of unknown reliability
893966 the bottom line is that only the cia and the u s armed forces are at war this situation cries out for remedy
893967 the bottom line is that only the cia and the u s armed forces are at war this situation cries out for remedy
893968 dis or negatively criticize those of the press who are not embedded nir rosen who out there at great risk to themselves to give us a picture of the other side
893969 we know where they are theyre in the area around tikrit and baghdad and east west south and north somewhat
893970 i did not i said i knew where suspect sites were
893971 you said you knew where they were near tikrit near baghdad and north east south and west of there those are your words http blog washingtonpost com earlywarning 2006 05 rumsfeld didnt lie but he shou html
893972 theres another way to phrase that and that is that the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence it is basically saying the same thing in a different way simply because you do not have evidence that something does exist does not mean that you have evidence that it doesnt exist
893973 the poll by oxford research international was commissioned by the bbc abc news and other international media organisations and released ahead of this weeks parliamentary elections in iraq in all 1 711 iraqis were interviewed throughout the country in october and november 2005
893974 an opinion poll suggests iraqis are generally optimistic about their lives in spite of the violence that has plagued iraq since the us led invasion
893975 the bbc news websites world affairs correspondent paul reynolds says the survey shows a degree of optimism at variance with the usual depiction of the country as one in total chaos the bbc report even goes so far as to flirt with the unthinkable the findings are more in line with the kind of arguments currently being deployed by us president george w bush he says
893976 either prove that you dont have them or we will beleive that you do
893977 unpatriotic is a defense mechanism and a sign of your insecurity on your part
893978 on september 16 2004 kofi annan the secretary general of the united nations speaking on the invasion said
893979 small change like a constituional amendment is bleak and the institutional and historical inertia is too strong
893980 goals have been achieved why are we there now what further are we accomplishing please do not misread these questions as confusion
893981 tactical one in 2005 it was strategic for all intents its affects are over
893982 issues facing our troops to get more information and further links regarding
893983 all people breathing easier because there is less and less support here at home makes no sense
893984 the morale fighting effectiveness and confidence of u s combat forces continue to be simply awe inspiring they are the toughest soldiers we have ever fielded the iraqi army is real growing and willing to fight the iraqi police are beginning to show marked improvement in capability
893985 are on a par with the best u s swat units
893986 are very badly equipped with only a few light vehicles and small arms they have almost no mortars heavy machine guns decent communications equipment artillery armor or air transport helicopter and strike support
893987 corruption and lack of capability of the ministries of defense and interior will require
893988 the crux of the war hangs on the ability to create urban and rural local police with the ability to survive on the streets of this increasingly dangerous and lethal environment
893989 a prerequisite to the iraqis winning the counter insurgency struggle they will face in the coming decade and yet
893990 we will fail to achieve our politico military objectives in the coming 24 months if we do not continue economic support on the order of 5 10 billion a year
893991 total lack of trust among the families the tribes and the sectarian factions
893992 a loss of the potential leadership to solve the mess that is iraq today
893993 there will be a significant chance of the country breaking apart in warring factions regardless of our efforts
893994 do we have the political will do we have the military power will we spend the resources required to achieve our aims
893995 corruption and lack of capability of the ministries of defense and interior
893996 total lack of trust among the families the tribes and the sectarian factions
893997 national guard lt paul rieckhoff the founder and executive director of the organization iraq and afghanistan veterans of america formerly operation truth represents someone who isnt a traitor but a loyalist to his military kin
893998 served to complicate the process of policy formation and implementation
893999 but it is a way of life i like the discipline the camaraderie
894000 seeing little kids and old guys salute as we came back made me feel so good
894001 it made me feel that i was doing something that was important and good for the world
894002 weapons of mass destruction particularly nuclear ones that could be passed off to al qaeda were the reason we went to war ostensibly
894003 we americans are the envy of the world because we have the best government everyone would choose to be like us if they could only shed their selfish dictators or their silly overly generous social democracies
894004 the last refuge of modest and chaste souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded
894005 4 000 to 5 000 children dying unnecessarily every month due to the impact of sanctions because of the breakdown of water and sanitation inadequate diet and the bad internal health situation
894006 weve already discovered just so far the remains of 400 000 people in mass graves
894007 human rights watch estimates that as many as 290 000 iraqis have been disappeared by the iraqi government over the past two decades
894008 many of these disappeared are those whose remains are now being unearthed in mass graves all over iraq
894009 if saddam husseins killing machine had gone about its daily business
894010 more than 100 000 kurds and that kurdish victims of the regimes campaigns between 1983 and 1993 reached
894011 iraqi officials themselves have privately acknowledged that the regime slaughtered as many as 200 000 shia
894012 the united nations estimate of civilian casualties of the war in iraq was 100 000 as of march 30 2005 23
894013 one study done by public health experts from the lancet medical journal published on 29 october 2004 found that an estimated 100 000 iraqi civilians had died since the us invasion began
894014 were quite sure that the estimate of 100 000 is a conservative estimate
894015 were not quite sure what our estimate means assuming our model is accurate the actual death toll might be 100 000 or it might be somewhere between 92 000 lower and 94 000 higher than that number
894016 it attests to the difficulty of doing this sort of survey work during a war no one can come up with any credible estimates yet at least not through the sorts of methods used here
894017 the us only goes to war works for its own self interst so
894018 on a contiuous scale how hard would it be to intervene
894019 but look over there they are jsut as bad or worse so why don t we worry about them
894020 since the end of the cold war the united states has been trying to come up with an operating theory of the world and a military strategy to accompany it
894021 the us only goes to war works for its own self interst so
894022 on a contiuous scale how hard would it be to intervene
894023 downing street memo of july 2002 that indicates the intelligence and facts were fixed around the war policy but regardless of how we got there what should the u s do next well talk to danner about the run up to war and the latest news on u s intelligence and iraq

894036 the children themselves fare very badly from influenza but they are also the source of infection for many adults
894037 there is an urgent need for the jcvi to review their decision
894038 this is mathematical modelling which is not quite the same as getting real data
894039 traditionally social services for people living with hiv were set up by and for gay men
894040 up until fairly recently the vast majority of begins service users were gay men
894041 but in the past five years thats changed dramatically and now the majority are african women who are often asylum seekers or refugees
894042 i hide my hiv status from my neighbours but unfortunately some people around where i live found hiv magazines in my dustbin and stuck them on my door
894043 l had to hide in my flat for quite some time until begin helped me out
894044 i still feel very lonely and keep my windows closed there are people who call me names but you get used to it
894045 with hiv related problems you cant always discuss them with your doctor or your family here you can have non judgemental conversations with staff and other service users
894046 therell be young women and young men out there who are straight and who have hiv
894047 this will be a chance to get together and be on the same wavelength
894048 there is still an epidemic amongst gay men and there is an imported epidemic amongst african people in the uk but those groups arent always distinct
894049 we know for example that african men are over represented amongst homosexually acquired hiv infection so there are often crossovers in infection but thats not often talked about
894050 prevention has to be the key unfortunately prevention is often the thing thats cut first
894051 these findings clearly identify the kinds of hiv prevention that are most needed by african people living in england
894052 having detailed information about which africans need the most support will help the organisations which fund and deliver services to better target their scarce resources
894053 the report re affirms the importance of making hiv testing services treatment and information easily available and accessible
894054 less than one third of people living in low and middle income countries who need life saving hiv treatment have access to it and it makes sense that people will be influenced by their experiences in their countries of origin
894055 the international hiv aids alliances partners in africa have been addressing these challenges for years and have developed innovative programmes to respond to the urgent need for prevention and treatment

894066 absolutely a pennsylvania statute provides for it its in their right to pay the legal bills for people who are being sued because of activities in connection to the charities
894067 to me theres a difference between paying for some suit thats in ones service to the organization that has been approved by the board and another in paying legal bills due to the unilateral taking of the assets
894068 the board had an independent attorney validate the hiring of our firm in the matter
894069 it wouldnt be appropriate to say anything about a case thats going to trial in five weeks
894070 would seek restoration of any assets that may have been taken
894071 alter those practices that have brought the public sector of this state to its greatest crisis since the great depression
894072 fiscal problems more severe than any we have faced since the great depression

894076 the sad case of germany should be a reminder to the english speaking world that a nation admirable in so many ways the heart of the holy roman empire the cradle of the reformation could become so corrupt that the land of dichter und denker poets and thinkers could degenerate into the land of richter und henker judges and hangmen by divorcing themselves from religion and willfully turning their backs on great traditions the germans fell into inferno

894088 catholics who remain faithful to tradition even if they are reduced to but a handful they are the true church theyve got the churches but weve got the faith
894089 catholics who remain faithful to tradition even if they are reduced to but a handful they are the true church theyve got the churches but weve got the faith
894090 not to oppose error is to approve it and not to defend truth is to suppress it and indeed to neglect to confound evil men when we can do it is no less a sin than to encourage them
894091 i believe in one god the father almighty maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible
894092 the apostolic and ecclesiastical traditions and all other observances and constitutions of that same church i most firmly admit and embrace
894093 i likewise accept holy scripture according to that sense which our holy mother church has held and does hold whose office it is to judge the true meaning and interpretation of sacred scriptures i shall never accept nor interpret it otherwise than in accordance with the unanimous consent of the fathers
894094 i also profess that there are truly and properly seven sacraments of the new law instituted by jesus christ our lord and necessary for the salvation of mankind although not all are necessary for each individual these sacraments are baptism confirmation the eucharist penance extreme unction order and matrimony and i profess that they confer grace and that of these baptism confirmation and order cannot be repeated without sacrilege
894095 i embrace and accept each and everything that has been defined and declared by the holy synod of trent concerning original sin and justification
894096 i also profess that in the mass there is offered to god a true proper sacrifice of propitiation for the living and the dead and that in the most holy sacrament of the eucharist there is truly really and substantially present the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our lord jesus christ and that there takes place a conversion of the whole substance of bread into the body and of the whole substance of the wine into the blood and this conversion the catholic church calls transubstantiation
894097 i also acknowledge that under one species alone the whole and entire christ and the true sacrament are taken
894098 i steadfastly hold that purgatory exists and that the souls there detained are aided by the prayers of the faithful likewise that the saints reigning together with christ should be venerated and invoked and that they offer prayers to god for us and that their relics should be venerated
894099 i firmly assert that the images of christ and of the mother of god ever virgin and also of the other saints should be kept and retained and that due honor and veneration should be paid to them i also affirm that the power of indulgences has been left in the church by christ and that the use of them is especially salutary for christian people
894100 i acknowledge the holy catholic and apostolic roman church as the mother and teacher of all churches and to the roman pontiff the successor of blessed peter prince of apostles and vicar of jesus christ i promise and swear true obedience
894101 also all other things taught defined and declared by the sacred canons and ecumenical councils and especially by the sacred and holy synod of trent and by the ecumenical council of the vatican particularly concerning the primacy of the roman pontiff and his infallible teaching i without hesitation accept and profess and at the same time all things contrary thereto and whatever heresies have been condemned and rejected and anathematized by the church i likewise condemn reject and anathematize
894102 this true catholic faith outside of which no one can be saved and which of my own accord i now profess and truly hold i name do promise vow and swear that i will with the help of god most faithfully retain and profess the same to the last breath of my life as pure and inviolable and that i will take care as far as lies in my power that it be held taught and preached by my subjects or by those over whom by virtue of my office i have charge so help me god and these holy gospels of god
894103 if you live not in the body which is christ you are none of his whose then are you you have been cut off and will wither and like the branch pruned from the vine you will burn in the fire an end which may gods goodness keep far from you so little does the roman church stand alone as you think that in the whole world any nation that in its pride dissents from her is in no way a church but a council of heretics a conventicle of schismatics and a synagogue of satan
894104 to use the words of the fathers of trent it is certain that the church was instructed by jesus christ and his apostles and that all truth was daily taught it by the inspiration of the holy spirit
894105 blind they are they pervert the eternal concepts of truth they are seen to be under the sway of a blind and unchecked passion for novelty despising holy and apostolic traditions they embrace other and vain futile uncertain doctrines condemned by the church
894106 have been changed three substitute canons invented amp introduced in 1960s with more invented later options options and more options individual priests amp parish liturgy committees get to pick drop or invent texts to push whatever they think the faithful should believe 12 posted on
894107 confession heals confession justifies confession grants pardon of sin all hope consists in confession in confession there is mercy believe it firmly do not hesitate never despair of the mercy of god
894108 as the father has sent me even so i send you
894109 receive the holy spirit if you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven if you retain the sins of any they are retained
894110 go tell everyone that when god forgives mens sins theyre forgiven
894111 confess your sins in church and do not go up to your prayer with an evil conscience this is the way of life on the lords day gather together break bread and give thanks after confessing your transgressions so that your sacrifice may be pure
894112 regarding confession some flee from this work as being an exposure of themselves or they put it off from day to day
894113 the bishop conducting the ordination of the new bishop shall pray god and father of our lord jesus christ pour forth now that power which comes from you from your royal spirit which you gave to your beloved son jesus christ and which he bestowed upon his holy apostles and grant this your servant whom you have chosen for the episcopate the power to feed your holy flock and to serve without blame as your high priest and by the spirit of the high priesthood to have the authority to forgive sins in accord with your command
894114 priests have received a power which god has given neither to angels nor to archangels it was said to them whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose shall be loosed temporal rulers have indeed the power of binding but they can only bind the body priests in contrast can bind with a bond which pertains to the soul itself and transcends the very heavens did god not give them all the powers of heaven whose sins you shall forgive he says they are forgiven them whose sins you shall retain they are retained what greater power is there than this the father has given all judgment to the son and now i see the son placing all this power in the hands of men
894115 the use of the latin language customary in a considerable section of the church is a manifest and beautiful sign of unity as well as an effective antidote for any corruption of doctrinal truth
894116 of course i feel a bit sorry for felipe because what happened to him has happened to me a few times this year

894121 but to have a problem so close to the end and after such a perfect race up until that point its a really bad feeling
894122 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
894123 but above all its been a great day for heikki i know what it feels like to get your first grand prix win its a very special day for him

894147 by many by some of whom you know nothing by others with whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer and the middletons but still i might not have believed it for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced it will always find something to support its doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today accidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to mr willoughby in your sisters writing i came to inquire but i was convinced before i could ask the question is every thing finally settled is it impossible to but i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding excuse me miss dashwood i believe i have been wrong in saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on your prudence i have the strongest dependence tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt that in short concealment if concealment be possible is all that remains
894148 no matter what you are no matter what you have done some of the fans will love you and some of the fans will hate you but i hope im in a good situation most of the fans love me and thats the most important thing when you score 30 goals in a season a lot of clubs come for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world
894149 undoubtedly he is not good were all very worried about him the truth is that this moment for him is very difficult he is in a lot of pain we still have to do more tests but it doesnt look good i think its better to wait and hear what the doctor has to say that will be more complete and clearer but i can say that it is not good he will be out for a while it could be a cruciate ligament injury well have to wait and see what the professionals say we now have go back home and recover our spirits from all this but it is also something that happens in football all great footballers have had these things and im sure hell be back to normal soon

894154 englands elite clubs are determined to exploit their international popularity by staging mini competitions in places like asia australia africa and north america during a 12 day winter break
894155 the prospect of a winter break will be well received by the football association and the england coach fabio capello though they will be less impressed by the idea of players jetting thousands of miles in january when they could be resting but what this pre season has confirmed is the global demand for english football and five four club mini leagues in such places as kuala lumpur dubai sydney johannesburg and los angeles would prove real money spinners
894156 only in the most worthy cases is a players kissing of his shirt badge anything more than an empty ingratiating gesture emmanueladebayor did little to challenge that marking his winning penalty against real madrid with this same synthetic expression of loyalty to arsenal after a summer spent exploring every avenue to leave for a better pay packet adebayor caressed arsenals cannon crest three times an impressive display of brass neck from a striker who spread his bets across three clubs before interest from barcelona and ac milan receded arsene wenger was asked whether he approved of such a celebration in principle and replied if its sincere and real then yes the trouble is that adebayor now appears a man for whom any sincerity stems only from the extra money he has been able to wring out of his frustrated employers
894157 it was without a hint of irony and no shame that adebayor pressed his lips to the club crest on his jersey when he buried the penalty that beat real madrid at the emirates yesterday the day before there had been boos from a minority of the arsenal crowd when adebayor touched the ball which for a home support usually about as rebellious as the swiss national guard was quite telling by yesterday they were much better disposed to the striker who had agreed to sign a new contract on friday for the fans who have made themselves aware of how eagerly adebayor courted milan and barcelona this summer there will have been a queasy response to his badge kissing arsene wenger doubtless looks at it pragmatically arsenal cannot afford to do without this man
894158 both profitable group and ambanis reliance communications are demanding complete control newcastles spokesman yesterday insisted such an outcome would not appeal and that although ashley was keen for the club to attract new investment preferably from the north east he wanted to remain heavily involved ambani 49 who boasts a personal fortune of 21bn is believed to be prepared to invest about 100m in new players and hopes that the process of due diligence can begin this week sources insist that newcastle have through intermediaries been offered to potential buyers in the united arab emirates and the united states
894159 the worlds sixth richest person with an estimated net worth of around 42billion 21bn nearly twice that of roman abramovich is a keen jogger once a fixture on the bollywood party circuit anil has kept a low profile since the family business split and concentrated instead on expanding his financial empire a hindu he is known to visit temples before the start of a new business venture accompanied at times by his mother who is trying to reconcile her two sons
894160 engaged in a high profile feud with his brother over the businesses they inherited from their father anil ambani does not sound as if he would be interested in ashleys concept of partnership if yesterdays report is correct then gaining full control of newcastle would surely be the ambition
894161 the ideal scenario as far as servicing that loan is that benitez manages to offload alonso whose sale would almost cover the cost of barry but with would be suitors deterred by liverpools 15 million plus valuation of the spain midfield player there appears to be little chance of that happening at the moment arsene wenger the arsenal manager did not deny his interest in alonso yesterday but did rule out any interest in barry this leaves ben tez looking to recoup about 10 million through the combined sales of pennant the winger who is the subject of firm interest from blackburn rovers and voronin who is being courted by a number of german clubs including sv hamburg sources close to hicks have indicated that the texan may be prepared to write off any shortfall
894162 why have daniel levy the tottenham chairman and martin oneill the villa manager behaved as though they are the victims of some great injustice in reality it is a desperate attempt to fool supporters into thinking that they put up a fight to keep said players that they are big enough to withstand the advances of the premier league bullies and that only the twisted lengths to which united and liverpool are prepared to go to get their man did for them in the end utter nonsense naturally but villa and spurs have made such a big song and dance about it all that short of being an entirely futile exercise many of their fans might actually have bought it
894163 firstly of course we have now made the stage of a great british institution match of the day yep thats right well be on there every week well whenever rupert murdoch hasnt moved the game of course great stuff i cant wait for gary lineker to start waxing lyrical about premier league new boys hull city for that is now officially the name of our club brilliant isnt it besides match of the day theres football first which if i understand it correctly is something on sky sports on weekend evenings whereby you press the red button and magically get extended highlights of the match of your choice now having never ever supported a premier league team until now football first was news to me bring it on no more fuzzy sundays in front of the championship its motd and football first all the way from here on in even youtube will have proper videos instead of grainy mobile phone clips
894164 he has been on loan at dutch club psv eindhoven for the last 18 months although his wages of up to 75 000 a week are thought to be paid by chelsea
894165 as we in the old world cling to our national and regional stereotypes thieving scousers disciplined germans cheating eyeties etc across the pond they took it for what it was a clash between two passionate sets of fans not a miniature exercise in nationalism when someone did make larger inferences it seemed at least rooted in common sense such as suggesting that mexicans having lived in the shadow of us supremacy in most other areas were frustrated at seeing americans beat them at their game or pointing out that antiamerican sentiment born out of obvious events totally unrelated to football was bound to spill over on to the pitch
894166 thuram will not stop talking now that he has stopped playing he is arguably the most well read soccer player of his time both in terms of the history of slavery and of immigration and integration he became a member of frances council on social integration while still a top defender for monaco parma juventus and barcelona he was the symbol of the european unions 50th anniversary celebration which used soccers example of sport leading society against prejudice one imagines that with his boots hung up and the second half of his life an open chapter thuram will become even more the champion of racial equality starting with his own fundaci n lilian thuram which he has developed to fight discrimination

894209 we were working on promoting water pumps for irrigation and drinking water in senegal to do this wed install a pump in a village show everyone how to use it and then leave it for a month for them to try out the idea was if people perceived there to be a benefit then theyd buy one from their neighbours who we had trained to build the pumps the pumps werent too expensive and the overall philosophy was that if everyone along the chain sees a benefit they will keep making selling and using the pumps after the project ends when we set up pumps in a village and the first water comes out kids explode in excitement over to where the water is emerging from the pipes sometimes its hard not to join them so thats what i was doing

894518 the lines of red are lines of blood nobly and unselfishly shed by men who loved the liberty of their fellowship more than they loved their own lives and fortunes
894519 god forbid that we should have to use the blood of america to freshen the color of the flag
894520 on flag day and during national flag week we remember those in uniform whose courage and sacrifice inspire us here at home
894521 we also remember the rich history of one of our oldest national symbols and reflect on our duty to carry our heritage of freedom into the future
894522 seeing the flag raised above all of the rubble and ruins of the world trade center instilled a new sense of pride in me for our country
894523 no matter what happens to the united states on foreign ground on u s soil we the american people will always continue to move forward rebuild and face any challenges that lie ahead
894524 the flag is a symbol of everything the united states stands for from our founding fathers up until now all that we have accomplished and the hurtles our country has overcome
894525 it is the american soldier who keeps the country moving forward and will never let it be taken down by any adversity it is what we fight for and if we fall in battle what our coffins are draped with
894526 and its what we are committed to protecting and defending no matter what the price
894527 it underscores the meaning and symbolism of the flag when you see it draped over the coffin of this young man who had the world going for him
894528 it has endured a lot being dragged through streets and burned and disrespected and spit on and stepped on
894529 and yet it has survived and served as a nucleus that brings this country together across gender ethnic and religious backgrounds
894530 it is the american flag that has united us and will continue to inspire patriotism in this country
894531 everyone had been digging and digging then suddenly everything stopped not a word was said seeing the body of a fellow marine covered with the american flag it was an electrifying moment
894532 each marine in lebanon wore an american flag on his shirt
894533 it did more than show that we were americans it showed that we were representing this country and what it stands for freedom for all people
894534 whats behind it are the blood and tears of hundreds of thousands of soldiers who have sacrificed the symbolism behind the flag is this long tradition of sacrifice to preserve liberty
894535 but what it represents are the lives of thousands of americans who have given everything for this nation who ask nothing in return but felt an obligation of duty to their country
894536 when you insult our flag you insult the lives and the sacrifices of all the men and women who have served this country
894537 you are honoring everything that we as a nation have accomplished what america has done and what america represents to the world
894538 when you talk about a flag whether its standing in a place of honor at a ceremony or draped over a casket or waving from someones house youre talking about a symbol
894539 but the importance of that symbolism is monumental it represents what we are wherever we are in the world
894540 and no matter what anyone else says about it or does to it the flag never loses dignity it only gains dignity because when someone attacks the american flag its because they recognize all that it represents and the greatness of this country
894541 ladies and gentleman we are very honored to have a special guest with us today please join me in honoring mr mccabe for his service and i get a hug

894560 as my 13 year old if fond of calling her friends are using

894564 today i am excited to announce the launch of a new blue chip index for india we are unveiling the dow jones india titans a 30 stock index tracking the stock market performance of prominent indian companies it will be licensed to financial institutions as the basis of investment products such as exchange traded funds
894565 the growing importance of india to the world and to dow jones and news corporation is obvious to all what the world needs is a trusted means of measuring this countrys development and an index that can be used by investors around the world to track the progress of indian companies and the indian economy we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company as well as for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend
894566 people are for the most part pretty straightforward if theyre not a citizen
894567 there werent lots of undocumented immigrants getting these benefits in the first place so it was aimed at a target that really wasnt there
894568 what it did hit though was a lot of low income citizens who had to jump through a lot of hoops
894569 its almost like were doing the least possible and were not willing to assure the public that in fact these laws are being implemented
894570 the world is changing and how we measure that change economically and financially is clearly a challenge and an opportunity we have seen a reweighting of risk around the world but the world itself is being economically rerated and so we need an index that allows investors to take advantage of these changes indian companies will obviously have a place in the global dow as will companies from other emerging countries where we have seen an unprecedented economic emancipation over the past two decades
894571 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape as with the dow jones industrial average the component choices for the new index will be based on the editorial judgment of the worlds leading business journalists that is dow jones journalists

894577 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
894578 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
894579 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence
894580 i feel that yeltsin permitted an enormous devastation of russia
894581 his academic research outstanding literary work and in fact his entire life have been dedicated to the fatherland

894593 on behalf of his family and friends in galveston we are grateful for honoring dougs memory in such a wonderful way
894594 ghf is really pleased to see this type of interest in our employees and naming it for doug is a special incentive to recognize the role of volunteers in the mission of ghf
894595 the doug kanoy fund really sets a great model for others to follow
894596 we hope that other donors step forward to add support to the philanthropic vision of mr leopold and mr evans so that the fund will increase in years to come allowing for greater participation

894626 that money should be used for today monday 04 august s pupils and not saved for future year groups
894627 children should have their entitlement spent on them heads and governors of these schools should be made to explain to their parents why money is not being used to improve facilities and increase support for teachers now
894628 we cannot grumble about under funding in cambridgeshire while this amount of money is available
894629 the figures for individual schools are distorted by the fact that there are a number of initiatives in cambridgeshire that involve schools working together in clusters with a designated school within that cluster acting as the banker school and holding funding on behalf of all the other schools
894630 we want to look at the entire stretch of road not just picking up bits here and there
894631 the speed limit should be reduced for the entire road not just the occasional stretch of tarmac
894632 i want to see 50mph on the entire stretch of road even the dual carriageways but what matters most is enforcement by the council and the police to try to cut down on this catalogue of accidents
894633 of the accidents that take place on the road not many are down to speeding they are down to careless driving and that is something enforcement teams have to look into
894634 im not going to speculate on the outcome of this meeting except to say that the idea is to get everyone in a room talking and to come to some sort of consensus i will be taking a few ideas into the meeting myself but its important that we try to agree an action plan for the future
894635 i will be doing everything i can to make sure measures to reduce deaths on this road are put in place as a matter of urgency
894636 we couldnt believe it we had been paying by standing order for several years and people had been coming to check the meter as normal
894637 there was no way we could have paid the 18 000 bill we would have had to close even now its a real stretch and we are having to cut back on things like entertainment
894638 im disgusted by the company and weve changed our supplier from them at home
894639 theres no way we should have to pay this back because it was their error over several years why wasnt it spotted earlier
894640 we are going to have a look at their tariff again and look at extending the payment arrangements

894642 a sentence like that will do nothing to deter him doing the same to other women in the future
894643 he became violent and she picked up her phone to call police grabbing it he smashed it on the floor
894644 he does not seek to excuse or justify what he did or put blame on the victim clearly his principal mitigation is his guilty plea
894645 sages mission is to be an integral part of our community
894646 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
894647 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
894648 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it

894664 theyre trying to find what kind of kid theyre going to be
894665 im excited to make new friends and go to a new school

894669 we showed the worth of our team and drivers but we lacked the total reliability which is absolutely vital
894670 felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed at what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end
894671 he made an amazing start attacking at the right moment and then he was comfortably managing his race in the final stages heading for a well deserved victory
894672 we now have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part
894673 we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as prepared as possible for the european grand prix
894674 it was a near perfect race one of my best but its one of the most frustrating races in my career
894675 as you saw everything was perfect then you know what happened and it did so without warning without the slightest indication
894676 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport but these things can happen
894677 now we must not give up but instead react quickly because there are seven races to go and 70 points up for grabs which means there is plenty of time to make up ground
894678 our rivals are strong but we have shown we are at their level
894679 it was not as bad as it could have been and not as good either
894680 i think i drove well i didnt make any mistakes its just that i had a puncture
894681 when i was then told about what happened to massa i didnt think much of it other than it was an extra place for me which is good
894682 you know things like seven do happen and to come back from that was great because its never easy playing this golf course
894683 theyre not easy holes you have to hit it in the fairways which i did mostly and gave myself good birdie chances
894684 my distance control and my irons were good and i thought i handled the pressure pretty good
894685 i know its not easy to finish off around this golf course because a lot can happen on the back nine theyre not easy holes
894686 i got 11 holes to pick five shots up and very nearly managed it ive just got to sort of shake it off and start again a blip is a blip
894687 when i get into contention and play in the last group i feel very comfortable out there now
894688 ive got a routine im going through and nothing phases me too much
894689 i hit some nice shots under pressure over the last few holes
894690 ive never really been one to give up out there its a world golf championship at the end of the day and i was still in third spot and vijay could have dropped shots as well and he ended up doing that
894691 he was 12 at the time and he won at 10 under
894692 in those situations youve just got to grind it out and see what happens
894693 theo is ahead of what he was doing at this period last season and he is still 19
894694 i hope theo will be a big part of the squad this season
894695 i have confidence in him of course but it is down to performances
894696 his first touch his much better and he moves the ball quicker his penetration and final ball is better
894697 there is goalscoring potential in him and i hope he gets it out of him
894698 we cannot put any limitation on his participation in the team
894699 the quality is there i dont look too much at his age just what he is doing on the pitch and at the moment the quality is good
894700 i feel adebayor felt people questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer always is to give on the pitch
894701 you play well and show you are ready to fight for your shirt and your team he does that he is a man with character
894702 you know how it is if you score goals people forget quickly their frustration you have to show it with performances in this job
894703 there are many good players outside of qualification right now and im below those guys
894704 this week is a good start but i really need to throw in a couple of top fives or a win or something like that to get myself on that team
894705 it is an important run but ive got to take it one round at a time one shot at a time
894706 the ultimate goal is to try and win next week i mean the majors are still the ultimate thing but id love to be part of that ryder cup team
894707 im the first one in the ring and i cant wait to get the team off to a good start
894708 i know ive got it if everything goes right i know i can beat anyone in the world
894709 its my home city can you imagine what it would be like to win a medal there
894710 ive done a lot of hard training its getting closer and everyone is anxious to get in there and start fighting
894711 once ive got the first fight out of the way ill get better and better
894712 the captain feels a little less pressure if he is performing well
894713 there have been times when i have struggled and felt the pressure as a leader
894714 to ask a lot of your players all the time when youre not performing well is a big thing
894715 but it is about being consistent when youre doing well and not doing well to try to be the same person
894716 that has been the struggle over the years there have been times when i have had to dig deep i have had my tough moments but this year has been a great year so far and it does help if youre scoring runs it takes pressure off you
894717 on the third day we came out a bit hot headed again in the south african way and showed too much emotion
894718 we lost our skill again and that is something we are working on all the time
894719 he snape is playing a big role in that and this win goes a long way to what he is trying to achieve from this team
894720 we have got the skill he is just trying to add little facets to our game
894721 we cant expect him to make a huge difference but he is making a little one day by day
894722 its serious and its the worst news we could have
894723 he has at the very least torn his interior ligament
894724 he is very bad very upset he is crying because it is a very serious problem and very painful
894725 he is a very important footballer for us but thats sport we feel bad for him he had bad luck
894726 apart from the fact that at times we found it hard getting into game and of course the injury to wes i think it went well
894727 in ec speak this is a euphemism for being required to put in place a system akin to a 3 strikes regime
894728 i think there are characters in the dressing room who can do both roles
894729 its not a decision i have to make thankfully but someone will want to do it
894730 there will be a person in that dressing room who will want to do it take on the challenge and thats what you want theres no point in taking on these roles if you dont want to do it but there will be someone in there who will stand up for it
894731 in an ideal world weve always said that you should have one captain and im sure theyll make the decision who will captain from now on
894732 the one positive from all this is that hopefully they can get one captain who does both forms of the game and that would be the best for everyone
894733 i thought the split captaincy wouldnt work but it has in the way that weve had me and paul collingwood
894734 results might not suggest that but in the dressing room it has worked
894735 in an ideal world i think one captain is the best for the team one voice doing all forms of the game that was when i was at my best because youre with the players all the time and you can really form a great bond
894736 i havent been to my real home in north finland for a long time so i think i will go there at the end of the week
894737 i will celebrate the day with my people in suomussalmi village where im from
894738 ive a little karting race organised on saturday which has become a tradition for the last five or six years but now it will be a very special event having won this race
894739 it will be nice to go and see my people there my family but then it will be back to business although i will even try to get something out of the break
894740 ill spend a bit of time in woking talking to the engineers and preparing for the next race european grand prix valencia
894741 this win doesnt turn my world completely upside down even if there was a two month break now
894742 im happy about it but this is just part of the goal i set myself because now the next goal is to repeat this and then after that to do it again
894743 we just need to keep up our concentration all the time
894744 of course i feel a little sorry for felipe and even for lewis because they both drove a great race
894745 but i know how they feel because ive had similar moments myself this year quite a few times
894746 after saturday ive been in a position to fight for the victory but something has always gone wrong something hasnt functioned perfectly
894747 so to stand on the top step of the podium and to hear the finnish anthem playing for me was fantastic it was a great moment
894748 it is something i have been targeting for many many years now

894773 the abundance of elements in the universe has increased as stars have accumulated
894774 and the formation and destruction of stars continues to spread these elements further across the universe so when you think about it all of the elements in our bodies originally formed from nuclear reactions in the centers of stars long ago
894775 dr yoshida has taken the study of primordial star formation to a new level with this simulation but it still gets us only to the halfway point towards our final goal it is like laying the foundation of a skyscraper
894776 we must continue our studies in this area to understand how the initially tiny protostar grows layer by layer to eventually form a massive star but here the physics become much more complicated and even more computational resources are needed
894777 its great to see chandra alongside hubble and viking as one of the major accomplishments in nasas 50 year history

894783 i think you overpaid on compensation i think you overplayed your hand with microsoft and i think you overstayed your welcome after last years vote and should do the honorable thing and step down from this board

894869 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking such political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
894870 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the budget changes will be on emissions from second hand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
894871 breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose

894880 lewitt toured the mass mocas campus of industrial buildings where the artist was immediately intrigued by building 7
894881 as weve built the interior partitions to sols specifications it has become clear that his understanding of architectural space was as masterful as his wall drawings themselves he consciously sited his wall drawings to engage both the interior of building 7 and its outside environment it is stunning to see how well his monumental aesthetic intervention within the heart of the mass moca campus of buildings is going to enliven the entire museum sol left almost every window in building 7 generously open to invite in a play of continuous natural light which is somehow typical of his creative spirit

894897 sesuai dengan ketentuan peralihan dalam pasal 71 ayat 1 uu no 16 2001 yang diubah dengan uu no 28 2004 yayasan yang sudah ada dapat tetap diakui sebagai sebagai badan hukum jika sudah didaftarkan di pengadilan negeri dan diumumkan dalam tambahan berita negara atau sudah didaftarkan di pengadilan negeri dan mempunyai izin operasional dari instansi terkait
894898 dan bagi yayasan yang belum memenuhi ketentuan tersebut diberi kesempatan tiga tahun untuk menyesuaikan diri
894899 apakah ini berkaitan dengan bukti tambahan tentang batas waktu bagi yayasan
894900 pada ayat 2 yayasan yang tidak memenuhi kriteria ayat 1 diberi kesempatan menyesuaikan anggaran dasar nya dan minta status badan hukum kepada menteri paling lambat satu tahun
894901 dan jika tidak menyesuaikan diri berlaku pasal 71 ayat 4 yaitu tidak dapat lagi menggunakan kata yayasan dan dapat dibubarkan berdasarkan keputusan pengadilan atas permohonan jaksa atau pihak yang berkepentingan
894902 rancu kalau satu orang sekaligus sebagai saksi ahli dan saksi fakta kalau mau ajukan orang lain sebagai saksi fakta
894903 dalam pasal tersebut dasar untuk melakukan gugatan adalah harus berbentuk badan hukum atau yayasan
894904 sementara dalam pasal 71 ayat 1 huruf b uu tentang yayasan disebutkan bahwa pada saat uu mulai berlaku yayasan yang telah didaftarkan di pengadilan negeri dan mempunyai izin kegiatan dari instansi terkait jika instansi terkait tidak mengenal istilah perizinan apakah yayasan tersebut bisa dikategorikan sebagai badan hukum

894906 tapi sejak februari 2007 tim kami tidak lagi berkantor di surabaya posko sudah tidak ada lagi meskipun demikian tiap bulan sekali kami masih mengambil sampel
894907 kami melakukan verifikasi lapangan dan membuat laporan pengawasan untuk nantinya dinilai apakah layak atau tidak perusahaan mendapat izin operasional
894908 izin hanya bisa dikeluarkan oleh menteri kami tidak berwenang soal perizinan
894909 sebelum terjadi semburan lumpur juga sudah dilakukan pengawasan terhadap pt lapindo brantas
894910 sudah berkaitan dengan limbah produksinya tapi itu tapi dilakukan oleh petugas lain
894911 setelah terjadi semburan apakah anda juga melakukan perbaikan kerusakan lingkungan
894912 tidak kami hanya membuat rekomendasi kepada unit pemulihan kualitas lingkungan di bawah asisten deputi pada awal terjadi semburan kami optimis bahwa semburan bisa dihentikan karena itu dibuat rencana pemulihan tapi ternyata semburan terus berlanjut setelah ada bpls unit pemulihan tidak ada lagi di lapangan yang ada hanya pemantauan di bawah asisten deputi pengendalian pencemaran lingkungan

894917 volume semburan lumpur yang mencapai 150 000 meter kubik per hari jauh di atas kemampuan sumur yang hanya sebesar 720 meter kubik per hari lebih dari 200 kali lipatnya
894918 pasti tidak berasal dari sumur karena ada isotop deuterium dalam kandungan lumpur padahal deuterium berada di kedalaman 20 000 kaki saya menduga dari patahan yang teraktifkan oleh aktivitas tektonik
894919 contohnya gempa di indramayu baru baru ini tidak dirasakan di bandung tapi terasa di sukabumi
894920 dari volume semburan yang sangat besar dan keluarnya lumpur bukan dari sumur pengeboran satu satunya kemungkinan adalah dari patahan
894921 di brunei pun pernah terjadi semburan di dekat pengeboran dicoba dengan
894922 hasilnya negatif bahkan sebagian besar di bawah limit alat ukur atau tidak terdeteksi
894923 dan saya uji lc50 dengan larva udang di habitat kali porong terbukti negatif kalau cuma beberapa ekor ikan mati itu bukan pencemaran baru disebut pencemaran kalau terjadi
894924 gatal itu karena mikrobiologi bukan bahan kimia saya punya teman dari puslitbang geologi kelautan dia bilang lumpur sidoarjo malah bisa dipakai untuk

894937 i dont know whether there is a god or not nobody does no matter what they say i think its perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing god into it but i dont know everything and there may well be a god somewhere hiding away actually if he is keeping out of sight its because he is ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance theyre responsible for promoting in his name if i were him i d want nothing to do with them
894938 he will make known to me the path of life and in the presence of the lord there is joy

894972 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
894973 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
894974 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on

895065 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
895066 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
895067 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury

895077 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
895078 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
895079 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
895080 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
895081 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

895095 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
895096 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit

895183 kp would relish the chance to be england captain and as good a player as he already is now the extra responsibility might just send him on to a higher plane
895184 he is an exciting cricketer who has a decent cricket brain to go with his talents with the bat and although he will be different to michael there is every chance that he could be a success
895185 there are times when pietersen plays like an individual as when he got out on 94 at edgbaston
895186 then compare that with the way graeme smith played a captains innings to win the game for south africa
895187 if pietersen is in charge it may give him that extra degree of responsibility
895188 with kp i think youre always going to get runs because hes a good player but maybe the captaincy would curb the flair that hes got
895189 its a tough one its all about the dressing room i guess who is the guy who can make the difference
895190 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
895191 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards they were both successful so why not
895192 the most important thing about being a leader is having the respect of t he players because then they follow you and play for you
895193 the captain feels a little less pressure if he is performing well
895194 there have been times when i have struggled and felt the pressure as a leader
895195 to ask a lot of your players all the time when youre not performing well is a big thing
895196 but it is about being consistent when youre doing well and not doing well to try to be the same person
895197 that has been the struggle over the years there have been times when i have had to dig deep i have had my tough moments but this year has been a great year so far and it does help if youre scoring runs it takes pressure off you
895198 on the third day we came out a bit hot headed again in the south african way and showed too much emotion
895199 we lost our skill again and that is something we are working on all the time
895200 he snape is playing a big role in that and this win goes a long way to what he is trying to achieve from this team
895201 we have got the skill he is just trying to add little facets to our game
895202 we cant expect him to make a huge difference but he is making a little one day by day
895203 i think there are characters in the dressing room who can do both roles
895204 its not a decision i have to make thankfully but someone will want to do it
895205 there will be a person in that dressing room who will want to do it take on the challenge and thats what you want theres no point in taking on these roles if you dont want to do it but there will be someone in there who will stand up for it
895206 in an ideal world weve always said that you should have one captain and im sure theyll make the decision who will captain from now on
895207 the one positive from all this is that hopefully they can get one captain who does both forms of the game and that would be the best for everyone
895208 i thought the split captaincy wouldnt work but it has in the way that weve had me and paul collingwood
895209 results might not suggest that but in the dressing room it has worked
895210 in an ideal world i think one captain is the best for the team one voice doing all forms of the game that was when i was at my best because youre with the players all the time and you can really form a great bond
895211 id already created that bond but i think it would help the new guy if he did all forms of the game
895212 your voluntary contribution is greatly appreciated but at present were very short of cash we would want 10 000 by the end of the week and would really appreciate your support bankcard accepted
895213 its not a cop out its a stand for what we believe in
895214 despite that knowledge the state government saw fit to throw caution to the wind and the residents of collingwood park are now paying the price in the form of financial burden and psychological hardship as well
895215 its just stopped all the plans that i had to look after my parents
895216 im angry i have to fight back ive just got nowhere else to go with it
895217 weve now got a house thats worthless and impossible to sell
895218 weve really got no option but to pursue the government for the losses for something thats not our fault
895219 they are entitled to take whatever legal action is open to them and we will certainly be looking at it carefully and working with their lawyers to ensure that any obligations the queensland government has are fully met

895319 at the moment productivity has dropped and ships are facing delays because of the monsoon
895320 the bad weather sometimes creates a situation where pilot services are suspended for maybe two or three hours

895373 on the morning of friday june 8 110 buses pulled up at the border site of nong chan a few miles north of aranyaprathet where several thousand refugees were now camped in fields thai soldiers in the buses told the refugees they were being moved to another better camp some refugees seemed to believe what they were told and were happy enough to leave the squalid overcrowded conditions of nong chan others were not one woman who had walked out of cambodia to nong chan with her three children only a week before said later that she was terrified when the thai soldiers began to herd them into buses
895374 each person murmuring angrily or fighting back tears tried to come to grips with catastrophe in his own way shocked disbelief showed on every face we had just come from hell and were being sentenced to return we couldnt believe our awful fate defeated many wished only for a quick death
895375 cruel as it was we could understand the lie but it was doubly cruel to push us back across in the north when arrangements had been made for returning us to the south it seemed little short of cold blooded premeditated murder the remote jungle had been chosen deliberately the thais wanted an international incident and we were to be it
895376 loaded with cambodian refugees from temporary camp sites all over eastern thailand hundreds of buses converged on a mountainous region of the northeastern border near the temple of preah vihear whose ownership had long been a source of bitter dispute between thailand and cambodia
895377 the path down the mountains became steeper the jungle thicker dozens scores of people fell onto mines those with possessions had to abandon them to carry their children down
895378 below the ridge we could hear people screaming and moaning those who had been forced over the border during the past two days stubbornly refused to move off the mountainside trails yet the press of refugees from above kept pushing them farther down the entire face of the hill had been heavily mined by the khmer rouge four years ago and everyone was terrified to break a new trail in the five mile wide occasionally a mine exploded as the crowd pushed someone off the trail since everyone wanted to step only where they had seen others step they slid cautiously downward only when forced from above by the pressure of others moving downhill descent proceeded at a snails pace
895379 one group of refugees desperately pooled whatever valuable they had left filled two buckets with them and walked back up toward the thai soldiers carrying a white flag the soldiers took the buckets and then opened fire on the refugees
895380 the chinese gentleman and his party had pooled their thai money in a red plastic bucket quietly he offered it to the soldier then asked to be pointed in a direction leading to freedom the soldier accepted the bucket and motioned with his gun down a side path as he looked the other way no sooner had the group started down this path however than the guard turned and raised the muzzle of his submachine gun they fell like dominoes
895381 i thought the nightmare i had lived through for years and the trauma of our escape had exposed me to all the suffering and horrors this world had to offer i was wrong nothing had prepared us for this first night on the trail descent from the cliff was like being lowered into the jaws of hell

895389 and its not just him its what he represented so then i thought why not honor three giants asimov bradbury and clarke a b c and do it by sending their stories to mars then i began discussing it with carl and other people and it grew into this bigger idea this notion of a science fiction anthology

895391 when the russian mission failed to make orbit and wound up at the bottom of the ocean you work for years and years on something and its over in a second and theres no plan b if your spacecraft fails thats it so i kind of wrote it off thinking what a shame it never got to mars thats one of the worst parts of space exploration and everyone whos in this business knows this so it takes a lot of optimism and willingness to confront that risk
895392 for more than a century mars has beckoned inspiring tales of wonder and adventure
895393 many men and women who now work in the space program first turned their eyes to the sky because of the childhood wonder kindled by the astronomical artists and science fiction authors featured on visions of mars and projects like this get people involved

895395 its fa ade created the impression of watchfulness rows and rows of windows crammed together stacked up and up rising to a clock at the top which stared out over the city as though it were a single beady eye an invisible borderline existed around the building passersby steered clear of this imaginary perimeter as if fearful they were going to be pulled in crossing that line meant you were either staff or condemned there was no chance you could be found innocent inside these walls it was an assembly line of guilt

895404 mom was sitting on the sofa bed eating the piece shed cut
895405 but whats refreshing is that jeanette walls doesnt come across as a bitter whiner
895406 jeannette walls compelling memoir is like watching a piece from the grand guignol theater one appalling and shocking scene after another flits across the page readers will be astonished and transfixed by moments from ms walls childhood unable to close the book despite a constant flow of upsetting and outrageous anecdotes
895407 this will not be a funny book i cannot tell jokes because i do not understand them
895408 christophers mind is logical and literal in the extreme early on he suggests that metaphor is form of lying pointing out that very few people actually have skeletons in their closets or apples in their eyes
895409 if he sees five red cars in a row on his way to his special needs school it is a super good day

895413 they thai troops said they will pull back only when the issue near preah vihear temple is resolved
895414 cambodian solders are being patient and adhering to orders from the top not to resort to violence
895415 if thai soldiers have occupied the vicinity of ta moan thom temple it is illegal as thailand recognizes the temple is located in cambodian territory
895416 rice exporters earned all the profits and did not share the rice export cake with farmers and rice processors
895417 we should use this opportunity wisely rather than close the door to imported rice
895418 on september 24 the na plans to convene a meeting to swear in if you do not swear in its new lawmakers your seats will be divided among others
895419 two million but you dont plan to attend the parliamentary session you are using this fact to prevent the session you wait and see if i am right
895420 you want to accuse me please go ahead but i just use rights to defend myself now the election has been already conducted and i have 90 seats
895421 we dont have time to decide if we will attend the na session or not
895422 it is not right according to law and inappropriate according to the principles of democracy
895423 the srp is protesting the election results as it wants respect for democratic principles and law and a balance in power between the government and the na
895424 the individual market really is the worst place to buy insurance
895425 people cant band together to take advantage of greater bargaining power in groups and as a result of that they pay more to get less
895426 by limiting product flexibility wed also be limiting the affordability and access to coverage
895427 it is quite difficult to understand all the provisions limitations and features of policies
895428 we need to make the insurance market more user friendly
895429 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
895430 we have been walking from sirhind town in punjab for the last six days we have reached here just now we heard of the tragedy yesterday but that has not made any difference to our resolve to pay obeisance
895431 the tragedy is unfortunate but that has not affected the flow of devotees
895432 its a question of faith the tragedy does raise a question in your mind but faith is supreme life has to go on
895433 with the removal of the interconnection charge a minute call will become very affordable to the public
895434 with the big volume of sms sent daily removing the interconnection charges in every message sent will still allow the telecommunications companies to earn substantial return on their investment
895435 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
895436 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
895437 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
895438 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
895439 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
895440 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
895441 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
895442 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
895443 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
895444 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
895445 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
895446 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
895447 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
895448 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
895449 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
895450 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
895451 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
895452 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
895453 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
895454 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
895455 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
895456 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
895457 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
895458 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
895459 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
895460 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
895461 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
895462 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
895463 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
895464 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
895465 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
895466 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
895467 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
895468 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
895469 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
895470 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
895471 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
895472 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
895473 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
895474 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
895475 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
895476 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
895477 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
895478 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
895479 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
895480 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
895481 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
895482 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
895483 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
895484 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
895485 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
895486 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
895487 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
895488 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
895489 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
895490 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
895491 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
895492 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
895493 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
895494 who are open to doing something on the production side
895495 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
895496 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
895497 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

895501 we are definitely looking into a few acquisition opportunities we are quite likely to be doing an acquisition in the coming quarters
895502 as the stock market moves to factor in a slowdown in the global economy the focus is shifting to defensive stocks from stocks that mirror the global economy
895503 the global economy led by the united states is getting weaker than previously expected and worries about japanese corporate earnings in the latter half of this year are increasing
895504 the sharp drop in u s auto sales is probably the biggest reason for the fall in auto stocks today
895505 theres a view that auto sales elsewhere will also fall because of increasing uncertainty about the world economy
895506 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

895513 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
895514 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
895515 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
895516 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
895517 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
895518 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
895519 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
895520 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
895521 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
895522 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
895523 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
895524 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
895525 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
895526 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
895527 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
895528 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
895529 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

895532 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for the company or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made
895533 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
895534 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
895535 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
895536 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
895537 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
895538 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
895539 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
895540 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
895541 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
895542 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

895549 i stood at the doctors side and watched him perform a partial birth abortion on a woman who was six months pregnant the babys heartbeat was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen the doctor delivered the babys body and arms everything but his little head the babys body was moving his little fingers were clasping together he was kicking his feet the doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the babys head and the babys arms jerked out in a flinch a startle reaction like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall then the doctor opened the scissors up then he stuck the high powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the babys brains out now the baby was completely limp i never went back to the clinic but i am still haunted by the face of that little boy it was the most perfect angelic face i have ever seen

895604 a cadaver dog was brought to the scene on sunday to see if it could detect any other remains but nothing else was found on a mile long stretch of shoreline near the site of the shoes discovery clallam county undersheriff ronald peregrin said one oddity about the shoes location is that tides in the strait of juan de fuca dont really move toward canada instead they move east and west five athletic shoes containing human feet have been found along the strait of georgia between vancouver island and the british columbia mainland since august 2007 the bizarre findings baffled canadian officials the first foot was found nearly a year ago on jedidiah island in the strait of georgia within days another right foot was found inside a mans reebok sneaker on nearby gabriola island the third foot was found in the same area on the east side of valdez island in february the fourth foot was found in may on kirkland island in the fraser river less than a mile from a the site where the fifth foot was found later on so far one of the five feet has been linked to a depressed man who went missing a year ago and two of the other feet were determined to be from the same unknown person one of the feet belongs to a woman the rest are mens feet beyond that the shoes and their origins remain an enigma adding to the mystery is the discovery of a footless body found on an orcas island beach in march 2007 about five months before the first detached foot appeared in canada authorities are trying to determine whether there is a connection between the body and any of the feet curtis ebbesmeyer an oceanographer based in seattle said when a human body is submerged in the ocean main parts like arms legs hands feet and the head are usually what come off the body ebbesmeyer said the feet could have been severed or detached from their bodies on their own

895634 we also realised that there were abuses in the factories making mascots and material for bocog the beijing organizing committee for the games of the xxix olympiad

895738 everyone was in such a frenzy of doing stranger and more exotic loans that we just felt it was time to back away
895739 firstfed is not currently in any danger of being taken over by the fdic nor do we foresee any scenario that could even put us in that position

895746 i watched audley harrison in the olympic final the other day and i think daves so much better than him
895747 hes the hardest training super heavyweight ive ever worked with and ive been on a few squads with audley
895748 he does the same as us he puts it on the runs hes not slow hes got a lot of heart
895749 i always knew i was up there with the best and i was beating them quite easy i just know now that if i perform i can win i just worry about myself keep myself in shape and i know anythings possible
895750 i expect to win the gold medal i know if i perform well ill get the gold medal its all on me really
895751 they dont want to draw me theyre worried definitely just being around this team we all want to achieve great things we all just want to win medals
895752 the whole teams talented and we spur each other on theres no reason we cant all win a medal with a bit of luck with the draw
895753 people are talking more about my chances of making the weight than the gold medal

895758 immediately after yesterdays game the club wasnt able to confirm the extent of lukes injury due to the unusual nature of its occurrence
895759 scans this morning revealed that luke has strained his left hamstring the strain is to the belly of the muscle not the tendon
895760 i dont think there is anyone on our team who has the physical skills he has
895761 hes strong as an ox he has a low center of gravity hes fast hes got it all
895762 understand that we have a chip on our shoulders we all understand whats at stake were all going to go extremely hard im really excited for our defensive line right now
895763 hes a big strong fast athlete hes a very explosive player hes learning how to use his hands better to become a more dominant player inside hes far and away our fastest interior defensive lineman
895764 i came in here with a huge amount of pride on offense
895765 everything i did i took it very seriously of course ill miss it but at the same time im glad i get to do this for my teammates and i get to show i can go out and play even harder
895766 when i first started this spring i wasnt used to the finesse of being a pass rusher
895767 the offensive line made a lot of jokes when i would just come off the line and try to bull rush somebody i learned quick it was a different kind of game and they were the first ones to tell me that maybe i could learn some moves
895768 sure we lost four starters but i look at the production of those four starters
895769 can we replace or get better production out of our front four
895770 it wont really sink in until i get my first sack
895771 if were not getting what we need out of our backup tight end thats a distinct possibility
895772 we are going to see what he can do there
895773 we feel we have made some good additions at running back and we wanted to see if we can give glyndon a chance to get on the field more

895784 my opponent said that he has no interest in protecting the lives and freedoms of americans
895785 my opponent voted against armor for american troops in iraq
895786 i think it is better to have american soldiers blown to bits than to protect them from bombs and bullets
895787 that was an attack ad in political terms candidates use these to define their opponent of course no candidate wants to define their opponent favorably so they look for a vote or a statement they can take out of context free of the context that gave the original act meaning they can then twist it in whatever ways they find politically useful there is no way that attack ad can be an honest account of what the opponent actually believes you cant fit that kind of honesty into 30 seconds so all attack ads are lies and distortions and the candidates who approve of them them are candidates who contribute to a political culture of lies and distortions lets put an end to the attack ad lets promote political honesty by putting an end to the political careers of those who think that lies and distortions are a legitimate way to earn public office
895788 my goal is to change your beliefs please give me some of your time so that i may do so
895789 leave me alone i just want to get on with my life
895790 i dislike it when people force their views on me so i will not force my views on others
895791 it is better that the religious person maintain the freedom to do harm to others than that his victims obtain freedom from those harms
895792 none of these historic prejudices have fallen as a result of people cleverly sitting home and doing nothing to protest against it
895793 refusing to protest religiously based policies that do harm to others is in effect permitting the harm done to others
895794 much has been written about the greed that marks the faggot vision of society of which my opponent is a member he now has a grand opportunity
895795 a jew which is a person who has a particular set of negative characteristics making him deserving of denigration
895796 a person who believes in the theory of evolution which is also a person who has a particular set of negative characteristics making him deserving of denigration
895797 thats a great letter post and all and i hate to rain on anyones parade but phil donahue resigned in 1996 he hasnt worked since unless you count that dumb show that was on msnbc for 2 weeks
895798 you clocked me at 90kph but i believe that i was only going 30kph i have a right to believe whatever i want to believe you cannot arrest me for going 90kph when i believe that i was only going 30kph because that does not respect my beliefs
895799 i believe that there is no law against traveling 90kph and i have a right to that belief
895800 here is a group of belief desire sets that you are not permitted to have if we discover that you have them because you have performed this illegal act then you will be arrested and punished
895801 if people believe that it is permissible to regulate thoughts then this is going to open up all sorts of room for abuse people will be fighting with each other over what we are and are not permitted to think this will lead to tyranny
895802 if people believe that it is permissible to regulate action then this is going to open up all sorts of room for abuse people will be fighting with each other over what actions we are and are not permitted to perform this will lead to tyranny
895803 i believe that there is no law against traveling 90kph and i have a right to that belief
895804 you clocked me at 90kph but i believe that i was only going 30kph it seems to me that its not that such a belief is prohibited its just that its irrelevant in the case at hand
895805 you have a right to freedom of speech so long as you do not say x y or z under conditions c1 c2 c3
895806 you have a right to freedom of speech so long as you do not say x y or z under conditions c1 c2 c3
895807 here is a group of belief desire sets that you are not permitted to have if we discover that you have them because you have performed this illegal act then you will be arrested and punished
895808 the agent has a desire as end to type the word typist and a belief that the letter t is positioned above and to the right of th ef key generating a desire as means to reach the index finger from the f key up and to the right to press the t key
895809 we need to measure compassion for people who hold an absurdly false set of beliefs with compassion for the people that those who uphold an absurdly false set of beliefs harm
895810 basing any moral conclusions on the myth of the social contract
895811 first the assumption that there is a compromise contract that everybody will have reason to sign is false
895812 even assuming that there is a contract for everybody to sign as i sit here ready to act what reason do i have to consider the terms of such a hypothetical contract my interaction is with real people in the real world having real beliefs and desires
895813 social contract theory ignores the vital concern with how to motivate people to abide by the terms of the contract
895814 because they understand that in a social organization they can achieve more than on their own
895815 if an act that conforms to a social contract rule also happens to fulfill the most and strongest of the agents desires given her beliefs then he will obey the contract if the two diverge then the agent will violate the contract
895816 how does your theory guarantee our ability to travel back in time
895817 it is important for catholics to know that the university of minnesota will not tolerate the deliberate destruction of the eucharist by one of its faculty just as african americans would not tolerate the burning of a cross and jews would not tolerate the display of swastikas catholics will not tolerate the desecration of the eucharist
895818 put a nail through a cracker kill 6 million jews enslave blacks for nearly two centuries and continue to treat them as subhuman for another 100 years after that its all the same to me
895819 a statement that my religious beliefs are simply idle prejudices of no real value
895820 to show respect for my religion you must refrain from eating pork if you violate this prohibition if you eat pork anyway we may take this as a sign of hatred and hostility towards those who view the eating of pork to be prohibited
895821 i think jews ought to be killed and if i could i would
895822 of course there is no real social contract the social contract is a metaphor like when your science teacher in jr high school asked you to think of electrons in an atom as having orbits like planets around the sun with each orbit representing an energy level
895823 i know exactly what strategy we should use with respect to iraq and my vote in the november elections will be given only to those who agree to embrace my plan
895824 honestly youre telling me that the one item that can most affect the rest of your life for better or worse is the high price of gasoline
895825 i dont know which one is the most important which is why i want somebody with sufficient breadth of knowledge to deal with all of them
895826 this demonstrates culpable arrogance in two ways the first is with the assumption that the price of gasoline is their most important concern
895827 but if they share a common interest in and knowledge of sports activities then the barriers to social cohesion are much reduced
895828 i do not think that any respect at all is due to those who hold absurdly false beliefs particularly when they base actions harmful to the interests of others on those false beliefs
895829 im not taking the crackers from any church im not interested in attending church nor would i misrepresent myself as a catholic to receive it
895830 it is freely handed out to people taking communion in the church the people who are sending me crackers have received it openly
895831 no this theft nonsense is a rationalization people are making up to justify hysteria
895832 there can be no rational argument against my position so anybody who claims to be presenting one must be wrong
895833 i do not want my property taken for this purpose
895834 myers theres a subtle difference there maybe an important difference i dont favor the idea of going to somebodys home or to something they own and possess and consider very important like a graveyard and desecrating that because what youre doing is doing harm to something unique and something that is rightfully part of somebody else its somebody elses ownership the cracker is completely different this is something thats freely handed out
895835 i will give you this cracker but you must promise to use it in a way prescribed by this ritual
895836 if the priest wants to take the fact that i am kneeling down before him to take a wafer as a promise to eat the wafer then and there that is his problem im making no such promise
895837 i am not taking part in the language culture right now so dont make any inferences from what i say or do as if i am participating in that culture
895838 i was just kidding sheesh cant anybody take a joke any more
895839 how are we going to prevent people from walking away with our property
895840 when i received the eucharist my intention was to bring it back to my seat to show him
895841 i will give you this cracker but you must promise to use it in a way prescribed by this ritual
895842 i am not in any way going to treat seriously the proposition that this cracker is was or ever will become the body of christ it is just a cracker
895843 we have every right to challenge absurd beliefs we have no duty to sit back and give polite respect for nonsense beliefs such as the belief that those who name a teddy bear mohammed deserve to die or those who take a cracker out of a church are guilty of kidnapping
895844 if you judge the reasons that i may have for giving or withholding consent on the use of my property to be unsound then you may ignore them
895845 it is not the fact that i conceive of your reasons as unsound that matter it is whether your reasons are unsound in fact
895846 this may be taken as an obligation to respect the beliefs of other people no matter how absurd which is a principle that the atheist community in general is starting to stand up against
895847 ok you have these absurd beliefs that are important to you for cultural reasons as long as they dont do any obvious harm to me or the broader society i respect your right to believe them and i am not going to go out of my way to offend you
895848 thats how we keep the peace by respecting each persons boundaries
895849 we reject your violence and stupidity here have some more you damn bastards
895850 that kid is a total douchebag give them back their stupid cracker and stop being an ass
895851 you wont intimidate me with your bullcrap hey look i have some jesus here mmmm hes delicious with cheez whiz
895852 as long as they dont do any obvious harm to me or the broader society
895853 we also have reason to believe that the catholic church cares very much about the theft of a consecrated communion wafer
895854 i dont think you have a good reason for wanting this property so i am going to take it with me
895855 once a priest puts the wafer in your mouth it is your wafer from that moment on therefore no theft occured
895856 anyone who would do that is being an ass hat
895857 the fact that the murder was committed by somebody else without a word of encouragement from me does not change the fact that if i have reason to suspect that a particular outcome would result from my actions then i am morally responsible for that outcome
895858 i will give 10 to anybody whose birthday is today
895859 only way to score one is through fraud or stealth
895860 father im not a catholic in a state of grace
895861 you accept this money only on the condition that i can come and take this property from you at a later date
895862 x is yours if you can imagine a story in which you were the owner of x
895863 i cant see how the human eye could have evolved therefore it did not evolve
895864 by this reasoning a woman who gets raped after wearing short skirts in the wrong part of town becomes morally responsible for that outcome
895865 did you really really just say that a woman who wears a short skirt somewhere is consenting to possibly being raped
895866 i gave up all rights to control the fate of the food the moment i set the plate in front of him
895867 theres not much we can do about it but hope that it does not become too wide spread
895868 i cant see how the human eye could have evolved therefore it did not evolve
895869 you think that some catholic taking a cracker outside the building is desecration give one of those crackers to me ill show you desecration
895870 if entity a is giving something away even though it is clearly being done with the expressed intent that it be given to people who meet and agree to condition c person b is entirely in his rights to also take that thing unless a locks it away requires signed contracts and enacts a double secret code word and handshake known only to the initiates in order to enforce c open doors allowing members of the public in well then its a free for all their problem also theyre bad people if they get mad and inconsistent as well
895871 myers is wrong but donahue is so much more wrong
895872 i will give you this job under the condition that you are not a jew
895873 did you really really just say that a woman who wears a short skirt somewhere is consenting to possibly being raped
895874 i am getting the impression that you are eager to create whatever you may need to twist my claims into something you can criticize
895875 if a nuclear bomb goes off next door then we are all dead
895876 oh a nuclear bomb has gone off next door thats just insane
895877 that slut was wearing a short skirt and deserved to be raped
895878 no woman should ever have to fear being raped regardless of any circumstances however given the state of the world currently this is an honest fear and based on what we know if you want to minimize the chances of this happening you can take steps x y and z
895879 do x y and z or you are to blame for being raped
895880 in other words you cannot morally blame the woman who wears provocative clothing for putting herself at risk of a crime because she voluntarily assumed that risk
895881 the woman did not do something morally wrong by wearing provocative clothing
895882 we can should not blame the woman for doing something wrong even if she is the victim of a crime since wearing provocative clothing is not wrong
895883 the woman voluntarily assumed the risk of being raped by wearing provocative clothing
895884 i tried plugging not x into your original statement and i still dont get it help me out here
895885 you said x i know you said x and furthermore you are a filty liar for denying that you said x and i am going to tell everybody i know that you are somebody who believes x
895886 ema here is how not x fits into the context of the original discussion now you owe me an apology
895887 you can have whatever materials you need to complete this project
895888 i will give you a quarter if you hop on one foot for an hour while singing peter cottontail then those are the conditions under which you get the quarter
895889 if you dont have time to give this subject some serious consideration then please move along this material is not meant for skimmers
895890 i think x and i will offer you my reasons but please be aware that we are both potentially suffering the ill effects of bias i would only trust me so far
895891 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
895892 what is most important for us is to have a customer sign up for a plan
895893 we think we can have multiple ways to make money
895894 companies cant really stop it they might as well embrace it consumers are demanding these types of devices which is good for everyone
895895 while the iphone is closed it does have the openness characteristics which are unique
895896 theyre trying to steal the birds bring guns money and whiskey whatever youve got and get over here now
895897 the difference between 04 and 08 is like walking into a different century
895898 virtually everybody who comes to us also goes to the post or the times drudge or yahoo or google having a sole source of news those days are over
895899 les nouvelles tendances de la mode new yorkaise ses lieux branch s la
895900 the whole idea of the christian message is that it is for everyone we love our church but we know not everyone will go there so this is a way of reaching out into the community with an informal service in a relaxed atmosphere
895901 it is also away of supporting our local pub the seven stars which like so many pubs in cornwall plays an important role in the life of the community
895902 we didnt know quite what to expect going into this and so we encouraged everyone to buy a drink and the service we planned was deliberately informal to allow for the pub being busy and perhaps a bit noisy however when i got up to speak the pub went really quiet and everyone was listening it was really a special moment
895903 we have a good relationship with the church and i was delighted when the vicar approached me and suggested he hold a service in the pub after all hes normally got more customers at 7pm on a sunday than i have
895904 patrick was keen to show some of his parishioners how good a local pub can be and also to show some of the seven stars customers what the church is doing
895905 were very much looking forward to this sundays service and everyone is welcome to come along and join in
895906 wir wissen noch nicht wie sich die geplante permanente immunisierung auswirkt deswegen testen wir zun chst nur an patienten die au er bluthochdruck keine anderen erkrankungen haben
895907 either way it does not speak favorably to the matter of his own moral character
895908 i want to thank all of you for showing up some of you have been here a while and you still show up i am honored
895909 its your cracker do what you want with it as long as you do not harm others if you want to pray to it then pray to it if you want to cover it with a cheese spread and ham and serve it as an appetizer then do so
895910 let him have the doll go ahead and humor him hes not hurting anybody
895911 the premise that you are grounding your call to do violence to another person on is deeply flawed
895912 the premises that some of my people are using to justify violence to others is deeply flawed
895913 nobody may question the reasons that these people give for threatening harm to others
895914 the types of speech that classify has hate speech includes
895915 myers theres a subtle difference there maybe an important difference i dont favor the idea of going to somebodys home or to something they own and possess and consider very important like a graveyard going to a grave and desecrating that thats something completely different because what youre doing is doing harm to something unique and something that is rightfully part of somebody else its somebody elses ownership the cracker is completely different this is something thats freely handed out
895916 lets make believe that this is the body of christ unless it comes within the possession of pz myers in which case it becomes a cracker again
895917 save the cracker or save the earth save the cracker or save the earth i dont know
895918 the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
895919 why do my fonts look weird on my web page
895920 i believe that you are the best person for the job however i demand that you act in such a way that you give up any chance of winning the election and actually hand the seat over to somebody who in that position will spell disaster for the country
895921 i am voting for this legislation even though it contains elements that i do not like because i do not see a better alternative available i am not saying that this legislation is perfect to insist that i only vote for perfect legislation is to insist that i never vote in favor of any legislation
895922 this is the best option that i think is politically viable at this time if you do not like this option then change political reality so that we can get a better version of this law passed sitting around and griping expecting political reality to change magically rather than by hard work while demanding that candidates act as if they are not running for office in the real world is irrational nonsense
895923 i refuse to support him because he refuses to act in a way that will cost him the election and give power to the worst 51
895924 of course the majority realize that my position is correct
895925 they have to recognize that it is senseless to demand that a politician take a position on that issue that will guarantee that he will lose the election to a worse candidate
895926 im voting for this because its not perfect but theres no alternative
895927 is there a way to give a no vote on this bill a spin that will turn 51 of the population against the person who cast the vote
895928 what type of spin can my opponent give to my vote
895929 but if any of you would be willing to do what it takes to get me some or even one and mail it to me ill show you sacrilege
895930 catholicism is a silly religion and you shouldnt believe in it
895931 it is good to anger and upset catholics because of their silly beliefs
895932 it is as if i gave a candy bar to my nephew after he promised to share it with his niece

895938 those are benches they have to be massive so they wouldnt fly in the air in case of an explosion
895939 if the church were to lose its hierarchy its clergy its vast collection of buildings its stores of learning amassed over the centuries even the text of its sacred books and had to face the world with nothing but the living presence of the risen jesus and its mission to proclaim the good news to all nations and people it would be no less a church than the church of peter and paul was perhaps it might be more of a church than it is now
895940 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through paul here quotes from the prophet isaiah who foretold that death would writings in fact the greek word hades is used only 11 times in the entire is thy victory
895941 to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
895942 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world
895943 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost
895944 for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost
895945 i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do
895946 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost
895947 the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world
895948 for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son
895949 and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind
895950 ye judge after the flesh i judge no man and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me
895951 now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die
895952 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
895953 inspired millions perhaps with the knowledge that one persons courage and integrity could in the end defeat the totalitarian machinery of an empire
895954 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
895955 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
895956 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
895957 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
895958 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
895959 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
895960 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
895961 this is what i told you while i was still with you everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of moses the prophets and the psalms
895962 and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children
895963 covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread of the separation between god and man when did the doing away of the tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it

895992 they needed to look ahead the torch in mianyang is a type of hope for the future and for rebuilding
895993 yes its cool and i have always wanted to be different

895998 boris johnsons ideologically motivated move to cut off technical assistance to venezuela will cost london a cool 7 million as well as doubling fares for some of the poorest people in the capital when energy prices are at their highest levels in history
895999 it is remarkable that he did not even inform londoners that they will have to pay 7 million for his policy and instead leaked the news in latin america

896009 have we forgotten what our ancestors have done in the cause of liberty dont we realize there are some lines we can never cross dont we realize we should never legitimize illegal violations of americas privacy rights which this bill does this bill says if the telecommunication companies violated americas privacy willfully knowingly knowing it was illegal we are giving them immunity where is the excuse for that where is the excuse for turning a nation of laws into a nation that will be led by a president who knows how to manipulate our fears we have got to know the law is our ultimate guardian of liberty and those on this side have accused us of having a pre 9 11 mentality let me remind them that july 4 1776 was pre 9 11 and heaven help us the day that those values are shucked aside at the service of fear

896021 yes all foreigners should be properly registered regularised and monitored for the well being of the people including the workers themselves
896022 the moral question here is that if illegal affairs can be bought with some money it only goes to show that rampant official corruption is also acceptable hence i call this the governments rampant excessive exploitation and destruction greed
896023 i think it is indeed short term thinking for a long term solution as the total costs of local workers versus foreign workers may come out to be the same and that is when we are talking of building a nation with our own people rather than relying on foreigners
896024 but how can sabah match that when the state has been at the lowest level employing all sorts of questionable people
896025 i think there is an overlap here as it is not so easy to do that when there are up to a million illegal people in sabah when most of them are illegally employed in sabah
896026 imagine if there are more than one million foreign workers in sabah how much money would be needed to pay for all those levy and related costs when the local economy is largely depressed with the latest food and fuel prices upheaval
896027 such a practice may further increase sabahs population by several folds as these workers may bring in their wives and their children so there is also the likelihood that in five years some of them could have a few children who would be born in sabah
896028 when that happens what kind of prosperity are we dreaming of when poverty is definitely worse off as we have seen happening in mindanao and elsewhere in the region
896029 love is patient and it is kind it isnt jealous or envious it doesnt boast and it isnt proud love isnt selfish and it isnt rude love doesnt want to always have its own way love isnt irritable and isnt grumpy love doesnt keep dragging up the bad things people do and wave them in their faces love cant stand it when people are unfair and love is always glad when the truth comes out at last love is always loyal no matter what always believes the best of people and always stands up for them love goes on forever

896035 semasa proses mengubati bapa mertua saya itu bomoh berkenaan dibenarkan tinggal dan bermalam di rumah saya tanpa pengetahuan dan kebenaran saya yang ketika itu berada di luar daerah kerana menguruskan perniagaan
896036 saya hanya mengetahui perkara ini melalui anak lelaki saya berusia tujuh tahun yang memaklumkan dia kurang selesa dengan tingkah laku bomoh berkenaan terutamanya ketika melihat hubungan mesranya dengan isteri saya

896047 yes i do wear a hijab and i am covered from head to toe but how does that illustrate i am oppressed i do not dress this way because i am forced to instead i feel this dress liberates me and makes me feel special because a woman is a jewel like a pearl she doesnt need to be shown off for the world to glare at her beauty is for the one she loves for the sake of allah swt her husband
896048 it serves as a reminder that im muslim and it helps me get close to god since wearing the niqab ive become a lot more confident once youre covered up people are forced to judge you not as you look as a woman but on your character
896049 prophet enjoin your wives your daughters and the wives of true believers to draw their veils close round them that is more proper so they may be recognized and not be molested god is ever forgiving and merciful
896050 enjoin believing women to turn their eyes away from temptation and to preserve their chastity not to display their adornments except such as are normally revealed to draw their veils over their bosoms and not to display their finery except to their husbands their fathers their husbands fathers their sons etc
896051 nor is the niqab a duty deriving from the sharia i know i will be criticized for my words but i think some muslims are committing a fundamental error focusing on external and superficial aspects without exploring more relevant themes and hence providing a distorted image of islam
896052 you have to stick to the rules of the country you are in the veil is alien to this country and it is certainly a nonsense to think it is appropriate in the context of a courtroom i would urge the judges ruling to come down in favour of common sense a lawyer must surely have to show her face and be able to speak clearly in court
896053 the agreement of his or her client and can be heard reasonably clearly by all parties to the proceedings then the representative should be allowed to do so
896054 wearing the full veil was bound to make better positive relations between the two communities more difficult it was such a visible statement of separation and of difference
896055 prefer it and think it better for britain if fewer people wore veils
896056 not a religious symbol and it is not required by the koran
896057 i will not allow the ignorant to talk about islam the veil is an obligation required by god those who do not believe that are not muslims
896058 i have lost count of the times that i have been admonished chastised ordered requested advised politely reminded to cover my face my usual stance is one of insolence i invariably refuse with a why should i partly because i cant stand being told what to do and partly because to draw a veil over my face just because someone has told me to and not due to religious conviction is nothing short of hypocrisy concomitantly i have had many confrontations with those self appointed vigilante types who want to give me free spiritual guidance

896062 hes going to be there for now we moved him a little bit around and stuff because he does bring a lot to us and hes a guy that you know may have a future with us because he can do so many things
896063 one sideline observer with nfl experience was unimpressed with the raiders passing game particularly with the amount of balls hitting the ground in seven on seven drills
896064 a number of guys on the staff had him extremely high on their list
896065 one veteran player admitted he was surprised at how ineffective and ordinary walker has looked since camp started and said he hoped he was simply the kind of player who showed up when the lights go on
896066 its called a long drive period so i didnt let the coaches pull the guys out
896067 he hasnt played a lot of football since hes been in the league
896068 if cable says hes doing well then maybe he is harris is still working on getting his confidence back though and he knows that there are plenty of critics and doubters out there when it comes to his abilities this is what he said about it
896069 of course you try not to care but its inevitable right
896070 coach cable does a good job of getting everybody to work together well be fine we just need to button some things up and well have a good year
896071 wed like to take his word for it but were going to wait and see
896072 theres a good chance the three teams that passed on mcfadden are going to be sorry they did i was skeptical when lane kiffin said the raiders would have traded up to get him now i believe it
896073 mcfaddens speed might end that stretch of games without a kickoff or a punt for a touchdown
896074 his high football aptitude has allowed the coaches to start tinkering with his role
896075 mcfadden shows up all over the practice field every day one play he is bursting through the line into the secondary and outracing an overmatched defensive back another time he is swinging out wide hauling in a pass blowing past a linebacker and sprinting down the sideline
896076 i just wanted some contact im still waiting for the game so i can strap it on and have some fun against guys other than my teammates

896085 guru guru kita selalu membanggakan kesuksesan kita tapi kita tak pernah membanggakan mereka itu yang membuat mereka miris
896086 kita pernah ikut acara reuni emas 50 tahun cuma tidak ada hasil hanya hura hura
896087 harusnya dari suatu reuni ya minimal ada yang bisa disumbangkan untuk sekolah
896088 dari hasil reuni emas tersisa rp 10 juta itu pun akhirnya dipakai untuk membeli hordeng gorden dan lainnya
896089 awalnya kita alumni mau menyumbangkan komputer tapi rupanya sudah banyak kita mau menyumbang masjid sekolah tapi kondisinya sudah bagus sajadahnya sudah banyak akhirnya kita sepakat menyumbangkan 3 pendingin ruangan ac untuk gedung perpustakaan biar siswa betah membaca di sana
896090 kita inginnya dari reuni ini kita bisa merangkul teman kita yang belum berhasil
896091 dengan reuni kita bisa mengenal alumni yang belum kita kenal dari yang tadinya tidak tau jadi tau
896092 ya sma 1 memang identik dengan pak burhan burhanuddin dan saya selalu ingat masjid sekolah karena di tempat itu kita sering begadang
896093 saya berharap rekan rekan senior yang sukses mau memberi bantuan pekerjaan atau minimal memberikan informasi tentang lowongan pekerjaan
896094 siapa tau dari reuni ini kita bisa melakukan pengembangan usaha someday ketemu di suatu tempat kita bisa ngomongin bisnis juga mengenang masa lalu
896095 harusnya reuni dijadikan sarana untuk merangkul rekan rekan yang belum beruntung bukan cuma untuk sekedar menceritakan kesuksesan yang dicapai
896096 reuni identik dengan orang orang yang sudah bekerja justru dengan ikatan ke alumnian ini kita bisa kembangkan membangun bisnis dan sinergi memang tidak selalu hubungan komersialisme tapi sisi kekeluargaannya yang perlu diutamakan
896097 dengan berkaca pada masa lalu kita bisa menciptakan pemimpin di masa depan saya berharap sekolah kita bisa mencetak orang orang yang lebih baik dari yang hadir disini

896115 one flag is missing but believe you me it will hang there one of these days soon the world championship of baseball
896116 just to be able go out there and command the strike zone on a consistent basis and throw all three pitches for strikes was big
896117 its like ive been taking two steps forward and one step back
896118 this is like spring training again its just something thats going to take some time
896119 of course thats my job but the first and most important thing is to be able go out and be consistent with all my pitches be aggressive and pound the strike zone it was very encouraging today
896120 i think today was a really big step in making that decision easier for them
896121 when youre pitching with just a fastball and your third pitch a slider its frustrating to be able to go out and execute today is a very very big step
896122 how long did it take ryan rowland smith hes already ready
896123 it doesnt take long in two weeks you can have him stretched out enough to go five innings and we have seven weeks to go were not looking for brandon to come out here and go eight or nine innings
896124 reggie jackson told me dont look behind you it will be too intimidating now i have to look forward and its more intimidating
896125 youve been with me all the way and as i mentioned last sunday each and every one of you stood on that dais with me
896126 erik said he felt good its just the first step but the fact he got out there felt good throwing and didnt feel any discomfort thats a great sign every day well add to it
896127 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
896128 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
896129 the offensive part of the game can go in cycles
896130 the thing thats most encouraging to me is to go along with some of the key hits weve had were mixing in the slug hit with it
896131 i hope not but if its coming i need to take it because i charged the pitcher
896132 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
896133 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
896134 hes had some medical issues but youre never ready for something like this
896135 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family
896136 he had a huge impact on a lot of peoples lives and he had a huge impact on my life
896137 during the season we spent more time together than we did with our families and our lives
896138 as of right now all of those possibilities are on the table
896139 until we can verify anything it has to be looked at in a homicide of this kind with a person whos from a neighborhood thats had some difficulty with gangs you cant rule anything out particularly that
896140 its a very sober situation were a family he had two families he was a great family man and he had a family here just like his family is grieving him so are we
896141 he was this close to moving out of that neighborhood
896142 and getting into for him his dream home it would be his first home were talking weeks away he was so happy everything was going well now are they going to have that dream home in a matter of seconds everything was taken away from him
896143 he was the cream of the crop and thats what really hurts
896144 youve got three kids that are going to have to grow up without a dad
896145 he was close to everybody he was one of those outstanding guys that there wasnt a person in the jail that could say anything bad about him he was a good fair man an outstanding deputy he was fair with the inmates but firm if i gave him orders to do something he was saying yes sir before i could finish it
896146 we always try to be prepared for everything but one thing we cannot be prepared for is when you lose somebody
896147 and through all of it you have to stay professional and do your job but you know were all human in some aspects we have to be more than human you still have to come in the next day and do your job and a part of you has been torn away
896148 you never talk about your family where you live your hobbies
896149 they know where you work they could just post up on the driveway and wait for you to leave
896150 maybe it fell off somewhere listen you can do it here and now on my sofa or you can wait until you get home and do it at your house alone without anyone keeping their eyes on you im doing you a favor
896151 im sorry mr jin but youve been tested hiv positive
896152 you dont go to any gay bathhouses behind my back do you i know they do a lot of bareback stuff in there
896153 see kyle we live in a liberal democratic society democrats make sexual harasment laws these laws tell us what we cant say in the work place and what we

896155 there are kids 7 year olds on the team and it is really fun i never thought id hold a world record to be able to tell them youre probably faster than i was at that age
896156 she sets herself up for this and she knows what she wants to accomplish
896157 beats just getting in the pool and swimming your 2 000 yards
896158 the olympics is a unique environment to test mental and physical skills
896159 it takes a great deal of ability and skill to stay focused on the task at hand
896160 the difference is that these types of goals are much more under the control of the athlete
896161 the process goal in particular directs attention to the here and now which allows the athlete to totally focus on the doing of the activity this is key to performing well
896162 the process goal has to do with being focused on technique and mechanics
896163 the process goal as opposed to the outcome goal is in their control
896164 this sounds simple but it really is quite difficult because the mind takes you to the past and the future all the time particularly in the olympic environment with its plethora of distractions and enticing rewards
896165 you have the freedom to put your mind where you want it to be
896166 there is a good chance that the mind will say negative things about getting up every morning to do your walk and at times prevent you from getting out the door because it doesnt feel good in the moment
896167 being aware of such distracting thoughts is the first step to counteract them then the next step is to clearly identify your true values if you value your health you can trump the initial discomfort generated by the thinking mind recognize these thoughts as simply thoughts and get up to do the walk anyway irrespective of what the mind says in the moment knowing you will feel better afterwards
896168 we saw the effects just 30 minutes after the participants consumed the tea and it lasted for two hours
896169 it is not unreasonable given the inquiring minds that read the new yorker to expect that an obvious caricature would be viewed as such
896170 i study morality from every angle i can find morality is one of those basic aspects of humanity like sexuality and eating that cant fit into one or two academic fields i think morality is unique however in having a kind of spell that disguises it we all care about morality so passionately that its hard to look straight at it we all look at the world through some kind of moral lens and because most of the academic community uses the same lens we validate each others visions and distortions i think this problem is particularly acute in some of the new scientific writing about religion
896171 average intake of uncooked food comprised 62 of calories ingested
896172 eighty percent of those who smoked or drank alcohol abstained spontaneously
896173 regarded by some as fragrant others as overpowering and offensive the smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust
896174 in this state the flesh becomes richly creamy slightly alcoholic 20 the aroma pronounced and the flavour high
896175 theyre just not that good so we were able to beat them were not that good either i mean it was like a dust bowl game two of the worst teams in the league playing each other
896176 any allegation of wrong doing by a member of the txdot family is saddening but this incident renews my commitment to transparency and integrity in all that we do i will continue to monitor this investigation and if necessary will take the appropriate disciplinary action

896183 the damages caused by the cultural revolution were seen by observers the majority of chinas population as well as the communist party of china as an unmitigated disaster upon the country and its people although differing assessments continue to exist in its official historical judgment of the cultural revolution in 1981 the party assigned chief responsibility to mao zedong but also laid significant blame on lin biao and the gang of four for causing its worst excesses
896184 knicks pick unless they start winning a lot of games really quickly i am pretty sure their pick is lottery protected so if it is isiah that is to be the savior of this team it is still possible i think although why we whould want any of the nuts on that team i am not sure maybe we could get them to just give us the pick for nothing as of right now it looks like it should be in the top 3

896206 the potential shift is massive dwarfing anything we have seen in recent years not dwarfing the industrial revolution though
896207 we allowed a lot more flexibility and a lot more competition among operators

896219 the american working class is being put in the drivers seat
896220 my take on this unfolding pension crisis is that unless government takes meaningful steps we may not pay now but we are certain to pay later
896221 let me argue there are two implications we have to be patient with the chinese situation indeed the chinese situation is not ideal but the changes are in the right direction patience is one implication and the second is that the external world has to be positively accomodating to the emergence of china
896222 fortune 500 ceos have come a long way in their understanding of china at the 1999 fortune global forum in shanghai they were still groping trying to figure china out by the 2005 global forum in beijing they felt assured many had socked billions of dollars into china operations and were visiting china 4 and 5 times a year increasingly ceos like what they see in china a nominally socialist system where government leaders all want to talk business seem to genuinely get the global economy and have the administrative muscle to make things happen fast a common ceo refrain state led capitalism ya gotta love it many draw a contrast between can do pragmatism in china and democratic malaise in india but the reality is a lot more complicated china s leaders are scrambling to keep the economy growing and hold society together topping china s development agenda the five e s employment equality enterprise energy environment
896223 four paradoxes of china 1 china is a huge economy but it s also a poor economy with per capita gdp of 1700 barely half that of russia 2 china is an open economy in the sense that it absorbs billions of dollars in fdi but in fundamental ways it remains essentially closed few chinese speak english chinese society is less open than that of india and ideologically it s more insular by comparison india is a closed economy but an open society 3 china s economy is highly centralized in the sense the central government oversees all appoints the political leaders and party secretaries at the state and local levels but the local officials have a lot of power and the government often has difficulty enforcing its will beyond beijing 4 chinese development seems remarkable stable in the sense that after more than 20 years of reform it is still a one party state in which the top officials in the communist party hold all the top government jobs but at the same time chinese economy has experienced change at a phenomenal rate even changing fundamental aspecits of the official ideology under that party structure china s five big challenges 1 gdp is growing rapidly but growth is lopsided more than 44 of gdp growth comes from investment consumption is just over 50 no other economy has had such lopsided growth even in the periods of rapid industrialization in japan and korea investment never exceeded 35 of gdp 2 rising social tension the current government has raised expectations for greater equality and social justice 3 natural resources if china duplicates the lifestyle and consumption patterns of the us we will bankrupt the rest of the world in terms of resources we have to find new ways of enjoying the benefits of modern life that won t add to the strain on global resources 4 achieving a political soft landing it s widely recognized among china s elites that the current system isn t compatible with a market economy but the question is how to liberalize if china moves too fast we may create internal problems 5 global leadership china s not used to being a world leader today china s interests are embedded in the global economy and yet we re developing the leadership and negotiating skills commensurate with our economic stature two implications 1 be patient china is moving in the right direction 2 the rest of the world needs to be positively accommodating to china s emergence we have to understand what happens in china matters for the rest of the world
896224 china is a good destination for investment the general public has more
896225 this is not in the spirit of how it was originally sold at a time when avian flu first appeared and is certainly not how we would like to see it used during the consultation we said defra should give them on the register the option to veto any change in use of their details on the register
896226 the register was originally set up in december 2005 in response to the increased threat of avian flu outbreaks poultry keepers with more than 50 birds are legally required to register and up to now the information has been only used for avian flu risk assessment prevention and control
896227 basically this is random on farm checks including veterinary medicine records
896228 this turns the register into an enforcement tool it will simply disenfranchise producers and could discourage them to inform defra of any changes
896229 and it certainly wont encourage those with fewer than 50 birds to register for which it is voluntary not compulsory
896230 the changes announced by lord rooker make a major leak of privileged information something government departments appear to specialise in a distinct possibility we are extremely concerned that this information will be used for purposes other than that for which it was gathered the very real threat posed by animal rights activists means that the information must be treated as highly confidential and not used for non animal disease related issues
896231 we will ensure that procedures and safeguards are in place to protect the personal data of poultry keepers and that these are consistent with the advice and recommendations from the report in june 2008 by the cabinet secretary on data handling in government and from the recently completed independent review on data sharing by richard thomas and mark walport

896252 i think that apple will probably continue to grow share for a while
896253 you will see much nicer looking pcs and more targeted efforts at creating a better experience for people

896261 i just repainted my whole house based of advice from wong tatt yew i changed from ici pearl glo paint to pentalite which is supposed to be better for the sonics lo and behold when i switched on my system last night with all the positionings and furnitures intact it sounded vastly different and dare i say slightly worse than be before the midrange becomes brittle hollow and slightly grainy and sibilance was high it just doesnt have the solidity and concentration of the previous sound i am no sure if that is caused by the new coat of paint not fully dried up but it certainly is an ear opening experience for me i suspect the moisture in the paint creates havoc in the sound reflection on the wall and maggie being a dipole is one well of a sensitive speaker p s i tried listening again tonight it is much better now with the mids getting fuller and more bodied amazing latest update this is the 3rd day and the sound has more or less come back in full force i marvel the experience

896305 you dont even need a computer you can just go to a public library or you can go to an internet caf there is no control no regulation and no laws nobody is censoring the messages

896309 the state or quality of being secluded from the view and or presence of others
896310 individuals are entitled to keep to themselves what they do online or offline unless some special situation like public interest in general demands otherwise in a civilized society no body has the right whatsoever to snoop over others
896311 the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will is to prevent harm to others
896312 imagine what ordinary users do when they log on they check email and fire off replies chat surf some sites brows or play games what is there to be secretive or cautious about however cafes may be registered with some central authority seating arrangements in them should be open screen facing outwards this alone will clear so many doubts about the policy of any caf and will define the kind of crowd that gathers there
896313 this is not the best way to track back miscreants any one up to some thing bad can sure outmanoeuvre such barriers big worry is that will any rule shift the onus of customers actions on caf owners or will we be made accomplice if and when something wrong happens
896314 i am located near the university of the punjab hostels and my clients are mostly serious student who come here for preparing their assignments i try to provide them with an academic atmosphere in the cafe they search brows download documents and get required material printed or save it on their floppy disks for later use or they sit her and compose their assignments
896315 i have some regular clients who can hardly read or write english but they have learnt to operate computers and internet what do you think they do online stop them and they will go find another cafe if the government has to ban pornographic sites isps should be regulated and not the net cafes
896316 the scene in net cafes in multan is no different than any other city in the country some 70 to 80 per cent of the visitors come for entertainment whereas only 20 per cent visit for educational pursuits most of the visitors are male young boys in posh areas however female students are also seen visiting
896317 i travel to different places all over the country in connection with my work and have to use net cafes to stay in constant touch with my company i use the nearest cyber caf where ever i happen to be i will revert back to telephone if some legal procedures are introduced to use the cafes

896337 you know this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people will give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
896338 i mean theyre booing all of us probably me mostly so yeah i take it personally
896339 but its not the first time ive been booed and it wont be the last time
896340 i think the organization has been put in a tough spot and its a difficult situation but were going to welcome him back and move forward as a team
896341 he confessed that he committed the crime because he had copied it from the game he played
896342 he wanted money to play the game his parents who work as civil servants did not have enough money to give him
896343 the death toll as of now is 148 and 48 people are injured
896344 people started pushing their way back and many women and children fell down whoever fell down was trampled upon by the surge of devotees
896345 were still investigating the incident mr quejano himself can shed light on the attempted killing
896346 ive known him since high school he is easy to get along with always full of jokes
896347 the still high oil price slowing growth virtually everywhere profit downgrades inflation worries and the continuing credit crunch are all big short term headwinds for shares and are likely to ensure a rough ride
896348 weve seen a lot of worries about demand slowing in the past couple of weeks but now it seems like the focus has switched back to supply concerns
896349 we dont know how long it will take constitutional amendments may take beyond 2010 kasi ang iniisip ng iba because what the others are thinking with due respect na itong that these possible constitutional amendments eh parang pakana lang ito dahil may ibang sadya ang administrasyon that these seem to be a ruse because the administration has other reasons for wanting the moa
896350 we cannot blame them for thinking that way but the constitutional process from where i see if there are going to be amendments will take place even beyond 2010
896351 it will have to go through our legislative process dahil hindi tayo magkakaroon ng plebisito kung hindi mag e establish ng bangsamoro juridical entity kung hindi dadaan sa batas because we cannot have a plebiscite if the bangsamoro juridical entity will not be established and if this will not pass through a law
896352 the president will never go into something that will go beyond the constitution our framework for negotiation is always the law
896353 the report that my clients have already been arrested is malicious and ill motivated
896354 my clients were fall guys they were victims of desperate policemen who were under pressure to produce results on the latest media killing
896355 they suspects should just wait for the subpoena and face the court we have solid evidence to pin them to the sison killing
896356 was a desperate move of the police to fast track the delivery of positive result to ease the public pressure
896357 no sane gun owner would use his licensed gun in the killing aware that it will be easily traced
896358 if were really the killers why was it that almira sisons daughter and her family did not immediately point us to the police they all knew us because we always meet everyday
896359 the accusation against us is false and maliciously motivated the whole barangay can attest to that
896360 its impossible for mario to be involved because we were together during the time of the killing we went to the police headquarters in barangay taguan in candelaria and got the power saw which was earlier confiscated from him
896361 no one in our village believes that they are involved in the sison killing
896362 the non disclosure of the provisions of the moa has deprived the people of its right to information and to participate in the decision making process
896363 this is a blatant violation of the constitutional rights of the people
896364 our market is showing some resilience despite a weaker wall street and high oil prices friday trying to break above the 2 600 level
896365 when investors get too pessimistic thats the time to buy
896366 this being so the entire process the negotiations involving the said moa and the drafts documents thereof resulting from said negotiations is covered by the doctrine of executive privilege which prevents the disclosure of information that could subvert military or diplomatic objectives
896367 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
896368 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
896369 they checked our identity cards and shouted kill them they are kashmiris we were dragged out of the car and beaten ruthlessly shouting anti kashmir slogans and bam bam bole they hit my head with an iron rod leaving me in a pool of blood
896370 the fanatics smashed the windscreens of my car and tried to set it ablaze however they changed their plan and instead snatched our valuables including 48 000 rupees shawls carpets worth three lakh rupees mobile telephones and clothes
896371 the shiv sainiks made us stand in a row and thrashed us with bamboo sticks for half an hour they nearly lynched us it was like a hell
896372 the fanatics beat and abused us warning they wont allow any kashmiri to cross jammu
896373 we wonder why the puppet administration is watching as a mute spectator to brutality of the fanatics if the attacks on kashmiris continue india will be responsible for the consequences
896374 we have registered a case against the persons who attacked the kashmiris at lakhanpur it will be transferred to lakhanpur police station which will take action according to the law
896375 its iran again the iranian issue remains fluid and it looks like more sanctions will be imposed by the world powers and they will likely raise tensions over iran
896376 some reports are saying much of the us offshore oil production facilities are in the likely path of the storm but it is a little too early to say what the direction of the storm is going to be
896377 the acquisition will put egg on a strong path to growth and position it well for the future
896378 this is consistent with what weve been disclosing in the past
896379 our acquisition of egg is in line with globes strategy to drive growth through expansion into adjacent spaces such as mobile content creation and distribution
896380 we believe in the egg teams ability to deliver a great value adding mobile experience for our subscribers in the philippines we are also excited about the prospects of egg in the overseas markets and are looking forward to working with melissa limcaoco and the rest of the eggs management team to further expand the business
896381 i made a decision not to politicize the games this is for athletics
896382 theres plenty of time for politics and im confident ill have time for politics
896383 one of the things i think people forget in the midst of some of this is how firmly and strongly the south korean people believe in the american relationship
896384 ive told the president i make no promises except ill push as hard as i possibly can to get it done before i leave the presidency
896385 i wanted both of us to die but unfortunately my daughter ended up dying alone
896386 i didnt have any conflict with any person but i felt tired of this world and that is why i decided to commit suicide
896387 one thing thats on my list is to stop pau from winning a gold medal
896388 our guys get it they really do understand whats at stake here
896389 there has to be a goal an objective above fixing the house of pain
896390 ultimately that results in that goal of winning a gold medal we not only have a goal to win it we want people to respect us
896391 weve been very arrogant about the game and said its our game its the worlds game it originated here
896392 the respect weve shown to international basketball over the past two years has shown dividends and well continue that respect and show the best we can be on the world stage i love my guys they will represent us well in beijing
896393 zydrunas is an important member of our team and has generally been a higher risk player
896394 in light of the inability to insure zydrunas adequately we will not permit zydrunas to play in the olympics
896395 we did lose in the world championships but we havent lost in the olympics and were going back to defend our gold
896396 russia and australia have changed their style to be competitive with us an up tempo style but also physical american players are the best in the world at that style so i think if our players come together well be fine
896397 wed like to remind senators that they are duty bound to protect all aspects of philippine life from unjust treaties like jpepa we should not allow japan to take us by a noose like a cow thinking it is being prepared for slaughter
896398 the jpepa is an unjust and immoral treaty that spells death of the philippines environment and economy
896399 japan will follow its self interest regardless of a side agreement
896400 majority of our senators have expressed that they have reservations about this treaty even they cannot deny that jpepa is unjust unconstitutional and heavily biased towards japans interests at the expense of philippine sovereignty economy and environment
896401 with the increase in the supply of tuna produced by japanese factory ships and their shipment to japan and other countries the local tuna producers and small tuna fishermen would be at their mercy by way of depressed prices
896402 it is now a fact as admitted by the owners of sulpicio lines that the mv princess of the stars was acquired as a second hand passenger and cargo ship for 5 million
896403 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched
896404 canon is whats been established until a better idea comes along
896405 the thing is like many games you need to ignore the grognards because they love the game so much they kill it and nail it down under a nice piece of glass where it can stay pristine and untouched

896407 stealing from the rich is a moral duty not a crime
896408 i think were also seeing a fundamental geek libertarianism problem here treating individual decisions and supposed choice as though they were entirely devoid of wider social context or cultural expectation

896414 whoever becomes the next president will have a very very sobering first week in office
896415 theres a total disconnect between todays report and what were hearing on the campaign trail
896416 the decision before us is whether congress will endorse with its silence the methods used to take us into the iraq war the decision before us is whether to demand accountability for one of the gravest injustices imaginable the decision before us is whether congress will stand up to tell future presidents that america has seen the last of these injustices not the first
896417 if we dont get a handle on this now in some form or fashion the next administration and the one after that regardless of party will take these abuses these powers these liberties with the fundamental institutions of our government and take them to even higher and higher levels
896418 our sympathy goes out to the family following this tragic death and it has been a difficult day for our coastguard rescue team and other rescuers involved
896419 didier will not play in our first game against portsmouth and will probably miss the second against wigan if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that
896420 but when you have a knee injury you just never know
896421 its huge because to win these tournaments is tough nowadays
896422 ive played five days in these conditions and had eight or nine matches in the last couple of weeks but ive put in the physical work and its paid off
896423 i got very nervous and he was hitting the ball really big but i hung in well
896424 it was tough for both of us and there were a lot of long rallies your legs really burn out there and they were some of the hardest conditions of the year
896425 but i stayed calm throughout and didnt waste any energy especially when i went behind in a couple of matches in the past maybe id have let that get to me but now im playing top players on a regular basis and im better equipped

896432 we see many children and adults who can perform skills and demonstrate knowledge accurately enough given unlimited time to do so but the real difference that we see in expert performers is that they behave fluently both accurately and quickly without hesitation

896437 we need to get the message out there that heart attacks on the silver screen and tv arent what people usually experience
896438 there are so many symptoms the thing is if you are feeling very unwell not like yourself and you have that little suspicion this doubt in your mind that you are maybe having a heart attack dont delay call 999
896439 i was really surprised to find out id had a heart attack because they always show people on television shows like coronation street keeling over but my experience wasnt anything like that
896440 two dutch climbers were rescued today from the base camp
896441 we will be able to have authentic information only after the pilots or those involved in the climbing expedition return

896443 we can take a helicopter up there to drop medicines and supplies but carrying out an operation is very difficult
896444 if there are any survivors up there they are pretty much on their own
896445 its very likely that these people are dead but small miracles happen all the time in the mountains
896446 the clock works because the human eye does not see frequencies above 60 or so as blinking but as a solid color this is how we see a tv picture as a full image and not a series of lines being drawn across it at 5400 rpm this drive spins just over 90 times a second plenty fast enough to fool the eye into thinking it sees solid hands and not a spinning bar of light
896447 we have extended jammu bandh by another five day from today over our demand to remove vohra and restore the land to shri amarnath shrine board sasb
896448 we will not be cowed down by the such autocratic attitude of the state government and would stick to our core demands
896449 government has adopted the path of confrontation by imposing curfew and calling army which will have serious repercussions
896450 there is war like situation in jammu as government has imposed an undeclared martial law as a result there is a lot of anger among the people against the present dispensation
896451 since samiti does not get assurance on restoration of land to sasb they will not hold talks with him vohra

896459 he is back to the national capital with the confidential report which sums up his interaction with the various leaders the final decision will be taken by congress high command on the issue

896461 you can get a much lower rate below 8 per cent of inflation if there is confluence of favourable factors such as moderation in oil prices and so on
896462 as things stand perhaps to look at a rate of inflation of 8 9 per cent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009

896470 its a done deal its kevin pietersen were not even accepting any bets for him if we did theyd be about 1 100
896471 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest its a job ive loved for five years and ive put my heart and soul into it my mind told me to pack it in and i just felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this decision will prolong my career
896472 last and not least i want to thank my family
896473 i spoke to my dad this morning and he said you can walk away a proud lad because youve given everything and that is all i ever asked you to do now im back in the ranks of the other players and i need to score runs to get back in the team
896474 ive not been scoring runs and that is because my mind hasnt been fresh there have been plenty of distractions as is the case with the captaincy over five years its taken its toll
896475 it is a total coincidence i made up my mind on thursday
896476 im disappointed for michael because hes been an excellent captain of his country and like paul collingwood he was probably one innings away from resurrecting his form
896477 i think the pressure from outside built up but he was well respected by all the players and i think he should have waited until after this winters tour of india
896478 im disappointed for him because i know how much it means to him but i dont think his international career is over by any means
896479 he may not have scored that many runs this season but his quality has been very evident i hope he can clear his head come back and get loads of runs hes got to have that desire to get back though
896480 hey whats a kid like you doing in a place like this
896481 not exactly sure what you mean there kid but why dont we ask the blackhead over there
896482 mephiles the dark was planning on bringing this world into the dimension known as subspace and in order to do this successfully he required three villains lex luthor xemnas and jack spicer to stop any heroes that came in the way of his plans this could only be done by turning them into trophies
896483 and proceeded to counteract the villains ploy by making a trophy collection of my own but what i did to make my plan foolproof was create the badges you hold in your hand they are infused with a special substance called revivatarium which can bring anything dead or in a permanent statis back to life i used these on you to make sure mephiles could be defeated if his plans were to succeed
896484 now be alert earthlings when its used revivatarium is rendered useless afterward so the badges will not keep you from coming back from stasis keep alert at all times understand
896485 we must revive him if we are to add more power
896486 subspace where the population is a bunch of ninjas in black
896487 just what we needed romantic stuff save it for the epilogue kiddies
896488 call me that again and youre as good as frozen
896489 were trying to find the other heroes and revive them so we can fight shendu again
896490 wherever you will fight i will be by your side my darling
896491 perhaps we should use it to get an aerial view of this place
896492 i thought you said you knew how to drive a spaceship
896493 wait youre not xemnas oh well might as well vent my frustration on you little man
896494 so what do i need to side with you and the justice dolts
896495 like it or not youre working with us for the time being
896496 ill help you all out but dont think this means were friends

896509 i have a beautiful cadillac sedan deville an 89 with 19 000 miles on it

896512 i stayed the whole day and read a nice book in their coffee shop area
896513 my friend rick brought me lunch and i stayed until closing then i arrived saturday morning at 11 minutes after six
896514 the tragedy is unfortunate but that has not affected the flow of devotees
896515 its a question of faith the tragedy does raise a question in your mind but faith is supreme life has to go on
896516 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
896517 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
896518 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
896519 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
896520 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
896521 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
896522 i would say its self explanatory and clear that you shouldnt extort patients
896523 i work on womens issues social affairs and workers rights

896526 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering
896527 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
896528 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
896529 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence
896530 i feel that yeltsin permitted an enormous devastation of russia
896531 millions of people associate the name and work of alexander solzhenitsyn with russias fate
896532 his academic research outstanding literary work and in fact his entire life have been dedicated to the fatherland
896533 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
896534 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
896535 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
896536 hello my name is and i have a video game obsession
896537 were working all around but thats the area of concern
896538 were going to do what we can and keep an eye out for thunderstorms its just a rough patch of ground trying to pinch it off in this were trying to shut the door
896539 we wouldnt do that unless we knew it was going to be safe
896540 if it would get to the ski hill were ready for it but there hasnt been any movement in that direction for three days now
896541 we got through three red flag days with minimal growth and all of our lines held
896542 we know that the line we have in will withstand any other weather events
896543 whiskey charlie nine that was a good drop but a little farther west theres some more smoke
896544 i really dont care this trip is about how many people i can help and how many lives i can touch
896545 i can tell you about every person i have hugged and who i have met
896546 im a man driven by passion but i am really not doing much
896547 im simply riding a bike going to a couple of places and working for a day
896548 she probably e mailed about 6 100 times and i answered each one back personally
896549 she always said that if i was near galveston i should come by
896550 after meeting me you cant go back and think everybody is a piece of expletive
896551 as a black man i know that black men need to see you dont have to be bad to distinguish yourself
896552 why should i care about muscles i cannot even see
896553 i prepare all of my own motorcycles so its great to be able to come out here and ride them right
896554 i had a great start but my bike started missing around lap five at least i finished the race and am still the singles points leader
896555 but were fighting back slowly but surely and it definitely feels good to have a second place finish
896556 it was awesome to be able to come out to a new part of the country and race i hope to be back next year
896557 there were some problems early in the night but they got them taken care of they did a good job for their first year
896558 its always nice to go to a new venue and get a whole new group of fans id love to come back here and race next year
896559 im so glad i got to come out here and compete
896560 i did a quick scan of license plates in the parking lot and about 75 percent of them were from out of town this event totally met our expectations as far as quality racing and bringing people into billings on their way to the sturgis s d rally
896561 a lot of the grand national guys came because were so far west of the mississippi and they dont get to race out this way very often i look forward to seeing everyone again next year
896562 i dont know anything about sales or negotiating i just want to wholesale properties
896563 they didnt mention that in the 2am infomercial i watched
896564 if what i am hearing is correct you would be in a position to work with someone like me who is ready to take your house as is and help you out is that correct
896565 a horseshoe hitting a rock let off a spark one fire was started when someone threw out an aerosol can and the sun concentrated on the bottom of the can
896566 we used to think of a 7 000 to 10 000 acre fire as a big big fire
896567 now we consider a 5 000 acre fire fairly insignificant
896568 we used to predict a big fire season about every seven years
896569 we thought that the 1988 fire season was the fire season of the century
896570 but since then we have realized that with global warming and increases in fuel big fire seasons are happening more often
896571 since 1960 there has been a 720 percent increase in people moving to the wildland urban interface
896572 before it was settled eastern montana had a 3 to 15 year fire regime
896573 that meant every inch was burned every 3 to 15 years thats why they called it a short grass prairie there were no trees here
896574 perennial streams that used to flow all year are dried up or only run in the spring
896575 a juniper can suck up to 100 gallons of water a day if its available
896576 then smokey bear came along in the 40s and 50s
896577 organized fire protection began in the 40s and 50s too fast forward to global warming and more trees on the land and more house
896578 fire season is 78 days longer than it was 10 years ago
896579 they didnt mention that in the 2am infomercial i watched
896580 they didnt mention that in the 2am infomercial i watched
896581 weve got a whole other mission now and thats to control the border
896582 im anticipating adding more than 25 agents here at scobey
896583 i anticipate them being in a crowded situation at some point but that will be several years out
896584 weve recently redefined the station zones to base it more on geography than county lines
896585 in doing that we think we gained more operational control and thats going to cause additional shifting and well have to decide what the staffing levels will be and where
896586 the first challenge is the lack of resources and training to do our jobs effectively
896587 a large number of cbp officer vacancies remain unfilled the ratio of supervisors to staff has increased dramatically at the northern border aggravating the vacancy situation
896588 we have enough staffing certainly to open doors and do what we need to do
896589 we could always use additional officers out there i would never turn down another officer position but ill readily admit that with our limited government resources we try to leverage our personnel the best we can
896590 ive got two starting here on the 28th of july
896591 we have 10 currently in training at the academy the people are in the pipeline theyre just not here yet
896592 i was at st benedicts school for the first four grades and then it closed
896593 you get into high school and there are other things to do i got into other things
896594 when i first started all the music was in latin members of the choir taught me how to read the latin words
896595 i still like to hear certain songs sung in latin
896596 i feel god gave me a talent and i have an obligation to share that talent
896597 there was no particular area or similar exposure it was people doing different things
896598 the tick can be in the mountains or in the sagebrush
896599 it was really fun out there and good thing we came out ready to go
896600 i kind of had some trouble going in walked a few people but came back and battled through it
896601 tyler did a good job he came out and did exactly what i wanted him to do gilmore he was something else a 15 year old kid coming out in the state tournament and doing what he did takes a lot of heart and guts
896602 being down seven runs is hard i give all the credit in the world to them for not giving up theyre not out of the tournament yet
896603 it all comes back to setting the tone we didnt set the tone early we win every inning after that but it all comes back to that first inning
896604 everybodys looking forward to it youve got to play a perfect game its going to be the team that makes the least errors and hits the best
896605 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
896606 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
896607 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
896608 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
896609 we have to start teaching these young kids that are getting on the internet and writing these things to be careful about the words theyre using
896610 one kid told us a really scary story about how he was bullied every day because he walked home i guess these kids pushed him down in the street in the bushes and stuff so we talked to him and last time we found out he was getting help from his teacher to try to stop the bullying
896611 the part thats burning into the backcountry is about to hit some historical fire areas which will slow it down because theres not as much fuel
896612 many of these old time border patrol agents came to be my close friends and mentors
896613 we would stop into each others office on a daily basis we communicated while on patrol and watched each others back like we were a part of the same agency
896614 the number of federal employees protecting our border in toole county has increased tenfold
896615 but the changes that have occurred are not without some negative consequences
896616 our agency finds itself in direct competition with the federal government when it comes to recruiting qualified staff from the local job pool
896617 its difficult all over but there are only so many people available in the local community
896618 i think its fair to say that most of the sheriffs departments are understaffed along the hi line
896619 if theyve got something happening up on the border at one of the farms or ranches a lot of times it will be the border patrol thats the first responder to that weve got a very good relationship
896620 realize that local government entities have limited resources and expertise to prepare such grants in relatively short timelines
896621 matoon is fortunate because she has some grant writing people in her department but some of the other counties dont have that capability
896622 grant opportunities are welcome but local departments do not have the staffing or expertise to prepare such grants
896623 its the reason the state searched for additional funding to procure contracted services to prepare the current operation stonegarden application
896624 as time goes on its my hope that new personal relationships can be forged communications will improve and recruitment will not be as competitive
896625 staffing shortfalls in our agency have a direct affect on our community at large while the federal officers are protecting the border our deputies are protecting their children and families throughout the county
896626 if homes in the wildland urban interface had noncombustible roofs we could save 70 percent of them
896627 seventy percent of those fires are caused by embers falling on shakes
896628 when firefighters arrive at a subdivision there is kind of a triage that goes on
896629 we try to save everything but sometimes firefighters have to choose which ones they can defend the chance of saving a home is better if it has a green space and a fire resistant roof
896630 the fire is not out by any means but its not moving toward the park
896631 winds are coming from the south and west and pushing the fire more in the other direction
896632 theres no question that this has created a lot of fear and angst
896633 i tell people that investing in the market is like walking upstairs with a yo yo
896634 for a hundred years the market has climbed but it has bounced up and down like that yo yo i want people to understand that even if the market is down it will come back they will make a gain over their initial investment
896635 weve always felt that real estate is the most solid investment even with the ups and downs
896636 we feel people moving from california where there is no place to grow and the snowbirds will be part of the upturn in las vegas
896637 it isnt so much that the markets have changed but the responsibility has shifted to the employees
896638 if they make a bad decision or pay a manager too much to run it they may not be able to retire
896639 when you get erosion both because of a slowing economy as well as investor confidence you get whacked from both sides
896640 what you get now is the fear factor they think ive been getting all this income for years and can i continue to count on it
896641 we have had a number of calls from people who hear in the news that the government hasnt had to bail out an investment bank since the depression they are afraid and want to move out of the stock market and into cds insured savings accounts or money market accounts
896642 but between taxes and inflation we tell them they are going broke safely
896643 what were telling them is this is not a good time for them to make a change they probably bought their shares at higher prices and if they sell theyll be locking in a loss
896644 if they can ride it out for a year or two then maybe they can shift into a more conservative position
896645 here is what concerns me the savings and loan scandal the energy scandal with enron and what has happened with the subprime
896646 were seeing more and more retirees coming in for estate planning because of the markets
896647 were in a bubble and it will take several years to get out of it
896648 its like being in a fistfight with yourself every day
896649 it takes so much toll on my joints on my muscles
896650 some days i spend my days crying because my body hurts so much i curl up in a ball waiting and waiting for it to stop or the tics to calm down
896651 he was a bright happy normal boy and it just came out of nowhere
896652 we had no idea what it was and as a mom you are trying to find relief
896653 we did whatever had to be done to help him live a normal life
896654 the tics were so severe he did not sleep he was malnourished dehydrated completely exhausted and black and blue all over
896655 i knocked him out so he could sleep and recharge his batteries
896656 i just wish we had a magic drug out there
896657 tyler is a wonderful charming funny guy hes one of the nicest guys youll ever meet
896658 the only reservation i have is if something happens that would take a toll on the people who love me
896659 i wish the surgery would come sooner days go by so slowly and weeks seem like months because of the pain it really is one of the hardest things for someone to do to live like this its not like the flu where in two weeks ill be better
896660 brain surgery is something you watch on a television its not something your loved one goes through
896661 he may not come out of it and that is terrifying
896662 his attitude was always exceptional and he was always willing to do what was asked
896663 he did not want his limitations to set him apart from the team
896664 i really believe god puts certain people in our lives and you have an opportunity to respond
896665 thats what we are all doing here is somebody special that has physical limitations and we are using our athletic gifts to support them and help them
896666 jonni and i have served on all kinds of committees and have been involved with all kinds of community things so its not unusual to be at a meeting trying to figure out how to help
896667 but during a club twitch meeting ill forget the whole meeting is about us
896668 it hits me that all these people that have come together are here for us for tyler its humbling
896669 i dont fear anything at all about the surgery i fear the pain my loved ones are going through
896670 but the alternative is watching your son beat himself to death
896671 but here we stand theres no place to go but jump off this cliff we may fly or we may not but there are no other options
896672 and aside from being willing to take the risk we feel god has provided us and led us to this point
896673 why he had to suffer to this point nobody knows but we always believed there is a purpose and all these people coming from everywhere in our lives to help ty we feel this is divinely orchestrated for this time
896674 therefore it is likely that the country will re enter into uranium mining and processing in the near future
896675 it is envisaged that the experience garnered from this sil technical and procedural such as the processes for addressing environmental and social issues and mechanisms for public consultation will help guide the country for its future remediation of the remaining sites and management of possible new sites
896676 if world bank funds were not available it is probable that cnea would have difficulty mobilizing internal funding to either complete the works at this site in a timely fashion or to put in place the required capacity and programs for technical design environmental consultation and awareness campaigns to address the necessary remediation measures at the other seven sites
896677 the remediation and restoration of closed mine sites is a relatively new undertaking in argentina therefore there is little experience with mine closure and clean up
896678 currently booming as a result of high commodity prices competitive exchange rates sector liberalization and streamlining of federal and provincial administration procedures the world bank is very pleased to support argentina in improving its management of environmental risks in the mining sector

896680 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
896681 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
896682 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards for west indies they were both successful so why not
896683 the most important thing about being a leader is having the respect of the players because then they follow you and play for you
896684 kp would relish the chance to be england captain and as good a player as he already is now the extra responsibility might just send him on to a higher plane
896685 he is an exciting cricketer who has a decent cricket brain to go with his talents with the bat and although he will be different to michael there is every chance that he could be a success
896686 in an ideal world i think one captain is the best for the team one voice doing all forms of the game
896687 that was when i was at my best because youre with the players all the time and you can really form a great bond
896688 in an ideal world weve always said that you should have one captain and im sure theyll make the decision who will captain from now on

896691 the 8 march general elections brought only a short term blow to some politicians but it did not change their thinking
896692 in this competition you win just by being in the race
896693 well there comes time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen
896694 if thats what happens then im going to give it my best shot and leave the rest up to coach
896695 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
896696 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
896697 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
896698 right at the top of the turn he took off
896699 i said this is not going to be easy but big brown set himself and took off after the leader
896700 i felt very confident in this horse running into the race he ran great i cant complain
896701 i thought we had a hell of a shot turning for home
896702 im very happy right now we made big brown run thats for sure
896703 most of them have that ability we just didnt get a chance to see it until today
896704 hes got some courage if he was a human id want to go out night clubbing with him
896705 hes just awesome hes got an aura hes a superstar hes champion and he just got it done
896706 i would say its self explanatory and clear that you shouldnt extort patients
896707 i work on womens issues social affairs and workers rights
896708 he said lets make a deal you give me information and ill make it easy for you to go israel
896709 contingent on an applicants willingness to submit any information except for reliable information on his medical condition
896710 games are not won on the day of the match but during the days before match day
896711 it is very important for these boys especially the young ones to learn from the more experienced players like thapelo tshilo mark mcveigh and lefa tsutsulupa that it is very crucial to remain focused
896712 the government is ready to support various sports sectors therefore each association should mobilise and encourage others so that sports practicing can be expanded throughout the province
896713 theyve obviously been studying tapes of our games and have come prepared for the way we play but we know they have done that so we are ready to counter any of their moves
896714 what playing in a military barracks i just cant even think of it
896715 the moment you were allowed in by the strict officers at the main gate there was always this feeling of being imprisoned it always had an effect on the visitors psyche
896716 get over this brough ha ha and resume civil conduct
896717 no i am sorry but you lost the privilege of seeing my son when you tried to throw him out of your house when you said he was no longer welcome except accompanied by me for public events
896718 this is a serious email about him he deserves to know how horrible you are being i will sue you

896724 monsters do exist in us and among us they walk in our shadow they can prey on us more as we fear them less we should know we created them
896725 therefore investor perspectives should be given pre eminence 15 by all parties involved in standards setting
896726 we recognize the need for balance among all parties involved in the standard setting process
896727 not that it investor perspectives always wins but it has greater weight
896728 we could be reaching some kind of plateau within three months but we dont see a rampant inflation that is out of control
896729 compared to the first quarter monthly inflation has not been growing as fast as in the second quarter
896730 this does not necessarily mean that it will decline since business activity slows down in summer before picking up afterwards

896738 are you technically a virgin if you never had vaginal sex but performed received oral sex
896739 undercut the notion that many engage in oral sex rather than intercource to stay technically virgins
896740 the researchers found about 55 percent of the teens said they had engaged in oral sex but that this practice was far more common among those who also had engaged in vaginal sex
896741 teens said they began vaginal and oral sex at roughly the same time by six months after first vaginal intercourse 82 percent had also engaged in oral sex according to the study
896742 there is a widespread belief that teens engage in nonvaginal forms of sex especially oral sex as a way to be sexually active while still claiming that technically they are virgins
896743 however our research shows that this supposed substitution of oral sex for vaginal sex is largely a myth there is no good evidence that teens who have not had intercourse engage in oral sex with a series of partners
896744 are you still a virign if you had oral sex

896761 arnold schwarzenegger is saying one thing and doing another when he first ran for governor he said he believed marriage was only for a man and a woman he promised to veto every bill legalizing same sex marriage he even said marriage is up to the courts or the voters to decide now hes flip flopped and betrayed average voters by pledging to fight against protecting marriage licenses for a man and a woman in the california state constitution hes showing everyone that he is integrity challenged
896762 cela a remis en question cette r ussite et toutes les autres r ussites de ma carri re
896763 yeah that happened with mine and it turned out to be x
896764 i watched the prices go up when i went to the supermarket
896765 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
896766 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
896767 its not only the high cost of food but the high cost of every other activity people are staying around their homes and looking to do things they find rewarding
896768 i think the thing that tipped the scale was the fuel and food costs
896769 we ordered three times as many fruit trees as ever before
896770 we sold out of all the vegetables in june seeds too
896771 were sick of rising fuel and food prices so were turning this weed patch into a vegetable garden want to help
896772 when she got ill she sent me all the information needed to run the site and asked me to take control of everything shareacard was where her heart was
896773 i went out to visit her after one of her surgeries and said i dont know how to tell you this but i dont know how to do any of this the look on her face i felt like i had disappointed her i came home and kept praying about it and asked the lord for the knowledge to do this for her
896774 it is so special to see that wonderful smiley face on the envelope its amazing how much people do care thanks again for all the special love
896775 the cards help jimmie through the day its good to know that someone cares the cards brought comfort and hope not only to jimmie but his family also
896776 i would love for us to grow really big and send out hundreds of cards a month the possibilities are endless
896777 not only does he often oversimplify the issues he actually seems to believe his oversimplifications
896778 are you better off than you were four years ago
896779 not that sen mccain is not an important figure but sen obama is either going to win or lose based on if americans decide if he can sit in the oval office
896780 clearly a myriad of polls are showing americans are skeptical especially when it comes to things like obamas ability to be commander in chief
896781 clearly the most beneficial playing field in my professional lifetime you have an incumbent president whose job approval ratings are in the 20s you have an economy that people feel is in recession whether or not it fits the technical definition
896782 there is a vast amount of defining going on here in 2008 at a much deeper level
896783 had benefiting him what barack obama does not have benefiting him which was an intensely organized highly focused and quite passionate set of essentially political action groups whose theme repetitive for the entire carter presidency was that we are weak the russians are strong

896785 the pure girl like world inside of me that is what lolita is all about
896786 i think many japanese women feel intimidated by high fashion in the west and feel that they can never live up to the refined beauty that they feel western women strive for
896787 so instead they shoot for a cute look one that doesnt require tall curvaceous bodies and instead emphasizes girlishness
896788 its not just the little cucumber sandwiches and punch its a party
896789 and its great because men are more involved with their children and it all starts at the beginning and they get to open presents too
896790 when you have a lot of the same friends it just makes sense to have one together
896791 its all about giving men something to drink and having good food

896810 in talking with customers we found that the flexibility to purchase groove on a subscription basis held strong appeal with small businesses and workgroups primarily due to the lower up front cost and the ability to get software updates made available during the term of the subscription
896811 the list price of office live groove will be 79 per year

896819 we are here to give a message to the government and our message is very clear we have just 100 months in which to effect a massive transition away from a fossil fuel economy
896820 the governments addiction to fossil fuels is not only destroying the environment but also peoples lives now
896821 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
896822 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
896823 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
896824 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field
896825 our various strategic initiatives are progressing well and given the good start to the third quarter and our clear business strategy we are confident of delivering future growth in 2008
896826 the weekend gets really packed i dont come here then

896829 the state has been messing around with this for a very long time
896830 and this is at least a one year study at the same time kids are playing on these fields little kids its frightening
896831 there were so many reasons to move forward and we couldnt find anything concrete to tell us to hold off
896832 if they say dont be on it when the temperature of the field exceeds high degrees then we dont go near it if the study finds if you breathe in the fumes from the rubber for 40 hours a week its dangerous then we dont let the kids on it for 40 hours
896833 but had anybody seen anything that indicated it was a danger to the students and were the parents we certainly would have said no lets check more i dont think connecticut has any great resources that were going to get a different result
896834 we shouldnt be putting more of these fields in until we know what theyre doing to our environment our children and our water supply
896835 we have looked at a wealth of data and studies that have been done on this topic and did not find there was evidence of significant health risks
896836 that said there were some data gaps so its certainly a good idea to study the issue further but theres no indication to call for a moratorium
896837 the state should not be issuing calls for a moratorium when it has reached no conclusion
896838 we dont want to rush into anything and get something that isnt credible
896839 i think theres a feeling that the issue of toxicity is controversial enough that it would be viewed as pretty drastic for the state to pre empt the towns with a moratorium
896840 i think a moratorium by the state would not be well received

896860 you wouldnt know it was a hybrid unless somebody told you
896861 everything we do is hazard assessment and this is a big issue out there
896862 it seems like a very simple process to make sure you are safe and there are a lot of built in protections in the cars
896863 but we want to get the information out about hybrid electric cars to all the guys to better respond to accidents involving them and protect themselves and the public
896864 if you turn off the car and disconnect the negative connection of the 12 volt battery you shouldnt be able to ever get hurt
896865 while the car is safe there is enough voltage in the hybrid system that it could be lethal

896872 south australia is in the box seat to be a world leader in geothermal generation technical skills proven project development and long term commercial success and the truenergy farm in arrangement strengthens this position
896873 truenergys decision to farm in is a tremendous show of confidence in australias innovative emerging geothermal energy industry and the potential of the hot rocks with which south australia is richly endowed
896874 as australias third largest energy retailer the company brings a wealth of experience in energy industry capabilities including generation plant transmission lines and sale of power to business and residential customers

896894 like kate and gerry mccann ive had dealings with the portuguese police
896895 but unlike kate and gerry i was only trying to report a burglary not the theft of my child
896896 one of the things obvious to anyone dealing with the police on the algarve is the sorry fact that no matter what you have lost there simply isnt enough of them to begin tracking it down
896897 that may be one of the worst twists of fate in what happened to madeleine that tragically she went missing in the wrong place
896898 eamonn was looking forward to his holiday and cant believe this has happened to him
896899 the only reason he brought so much cash is because he didnt want to use his credit card every time the kids needed some money
896900 hes not very happy because he was staying a top quality hotel and his family could quite easily
896901 police are investigating a burglary in the villa moura area and enquiries are continuing
896902 we never expected anything like this to happen it was awful
896903 not only was our dream holiday ruined but this man made off with valuables which were of sentimental value
896904 i was obviously very disappointed that that was still part of the scenario going forward
896905 i gave it some thought and realised that at the end of it all there was little point in pretending gareth would want to join liverpool and therefore there would be no deadline
896906 i have agreed with gareth now that liverpool have got all the time in the world if they want to raise the money thats the case thats it the ball is firmly in liverpools court thats fine not a problem
896907 from pointing us in the right direction to building up our contacts the innovation agents network has helped us immensely after putting us in contact with corkbic our opportunities have broadened and this opportunity has really opened the market for us we couldnt have done it without them
896908 through the facilitation of cross border links we empower businesses such as eqe to access help from partner organisations such as corkbic and their extensive network of local contacts
896909 while this is just one way the network encourages innovation based growth we also place a wide range of resources at the fingertips of smes across northern ireland
896910 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
896911 we are not calling for her to stand down as an mp or an mla that is up to the people of strangford but in terms of being in a position at the heart of government in northern ireland she does have to go

896914 this technology is a potential asset in the fight against gun crime by notifying police as soon as a shot is fired it could save invaluable time in reaching a crime scene
896915 american police have mostly used this for area protection and to accompany visiting dignitaries
896916 part of its use is as a deterrent when criminals know they can be heard and found they are more likely to think twice before using firearms twenty nine different police forces wouldnt put their faith in technology that didnt work
896917 there will be advantages to british police knowing for sure where a gun or explosion has gone off
896918 and the concerns over civil liberties that are associated with cctv dont affect shotspotter because it only detects a certain level of noise not normal conversation
896919 we are extremely proud of the many heroic and brave achievements of our son and brother gerard
896920 he brought honour not only to us his family but the whole country when he became the first irishman to summit k2 on friday
896921 the last few days have been a rollercoaster of emotions as we celebrated with joy his historic achievement and now must try to come to terms with the untimely loss of a great son brother and friend
896922 mr mcdonnell had climbed everest in 2003 but was unsuccessful during an attempt on k2 in 2006
896923 i was on numerous expeditions with ger and he was one of the best climbers in the world
896924 he was safe fast and strong but that isnt anything in the face of nature
896925 gerards love of mountain climbing was surpassed only by his love for his family and friends

896928 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
896929 they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them
896930 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no deal
896931 the strength of the euro and the competitive rates offered by our retailers help to attract southern shoppers
896932 there is a benefit in the euro sterling differential for retailers in northern ireland but how long it will last nobody knows
896933 we just have to make hay while the sun shines

896935 a shopkeeper in kilkenny told me he had bought 120 easter eggs in sainsburys in newry because it was cheaper than buying wholesale in the republic
896936 by investing in key operations across the business we are improving our processes and turnaround times and significantly increasing our sales outside northern ireland
896937 we recognised the potential to ultimately increase our turnover by upgrading the accounting invoicing customer database and stock management elements of our it systems
896938 new document management software helps us to streamline operations and improve our bottom line
896939 our customer relationship management has become even better with the help of new software helping us to retain and build business with our existing customers whilst focusing on the development of new opportunities
896940 newly recruited management sales and production staff are making strong contributions to the growth of the company helping us to meet the increasing demand for our products
896941 this investment demonstrates that camco is committed to increasing its exports by developing its capability and improving its competitiveness
896942 camco has recognised that increasing the skills levels of its staff is a key factor for adding customer value increasing sales achieving sustainable growth and fully realising its potential
896943 although northern ireland has experienced a downturn in the headline number of manufacturing organisations in recent years the remaining businesses are still undergoing huge positive change
896944 these developments have created a large number of jobs across the manufacturing and scientific sectors at all levels from support posts to senior management and ultimately a very buoyant market but the skills shortage issue still requires attention
896945 this new relationship with carecall is part of a number of initiatives we are implementing to support our staff members within the workplace
896946 we have been at this about six years we tracked down the american victims to allow us to take the case in the first place
896947 they the americans will now be entitled to get compensation i dont begrudge it to them we have been working on this for six years to hold colonel gaddafi responsible we thought at long last there was some justice in the world
896948 selfishly settles some plaintiffs claims and throws the rest of the plaintiffs to the wolves seeking to bar these victims from proceeding further with legitimate litigation against libya
896949 like kate and gerry mccann ive had dealings with the portuguese police

896959 f k off back to connemara where you come from
896960 ryanair has been attacking me and my business for the past two years their strategy is to close down regional airports and aer arann
896961 so i called a meeting with him some months back to ask him face to face about what he was doing
896962 his airline has about 55 million passengers but theyre focusing on a small little airline with one million passengers it doesnt seem to add up for me that he is putting so much time and energy in to that
896963 so i rang him up last year and i said can i meet you to see what the story is and to see what youre at here
896964 thats when he told me that hed give me a bit of advice and said why dont you fuck off back to connemara where you came from then he said in no uncertain terms that he was going to take my business out and either take over or do the same to aer lingus
896965 i took it to mean that this is the situation and that this is the aim in other words if you cant stand the heat then get out of the kitchen and i think that was just his way of putting it
896966 i wasnt surprised by his comments he has made ruder remarks in his time but i just think that if this is the image of the irish business person abroad because he is a world class airline manager then thats certainly not a good thing
896967 what really hurt me was the way he pretended to play the fiddle the connemara remark didnt damage or hurt me but the fiddle thing was crazy
896968 i was just asking him what his strategy was what was he was trying to do what was his beef with aer arann and he told me he doesnt have beef with aer arann
896969 i said michael youve 700 routes ive only 40 but youre focusing on my key 40 routes i said to him its about you competing with me rather than me competing with you and then thats when he started pretending to play the fiddle he did that on two or three occasions during the meeting i got very frustrated but i didnt say anything to him i realised it was probably a mistake for me to go and meet the guy there was no point on arguing with him
896970 i came up one stairs to meet with him and afterwards i was walking down the stairs and he said no ill walk you out
896971 i felt that was the reason because i had said to him ill go out this way ill go out this way the way i came in and he replied ah no no no well go out this other way and he walked me the long way around through the office
896972 he uses a lot of bullying tactics towards aer arann but im not worried about it worrying is not a productive pastime ive a tsunami hitting me and thats ryanair and i have to do what i have to do to protect my business and survive this tsunami
896973 but all thats not withstanding that we are in extremely difficult and challenging times
896974 its just very unfortunate that a fellow irishman is trying to close me down the future is looking tough and there are some very challenging times ahead a lot of things have gone against us fuel is the big thing and i dont know what will happen with the economy well have to just wait and see but i believe aer arann is reasonably solid in the current climate and we are looking forward to maintaining our position as one of the top european airlines
896975 i was taken aback but you have to have a tough skin in this business i want michael oleary to know that you can take the man out of connemara but you cant take the connemara out of the man and i aint giving up easily
896976 i dont want it to get personal between myself and him i dont want to throw stuff at him in the media im not interested in a media war with michael oleary
896977 i think its important to say that in relation to the success that michael oleary has achieved with ryanair its unparalleled
896978 i think he has created a huge success out of the airline and i very much admire that and i wish him and the team in ryanair well and even more continued success
896979 i have huge respect for what michael oleary has achieved but i think he needs to realise that ryanair could be a lot more successful if their style was more ethical and not simply a my way or the highway approach you dont make money by screwing everyone around you
896980 f k off back to connemara where you came from
896981 padraig o ceidighs claim that he called a meeting with michael oleary in recent months is entirely untrue
896982 michael oleary has had no request from padraig o ceidigh for a meeting in recent months and nor has any such meeting been called or taken place during the last seven months of 2008
896983 michael oleary is disappointed by these latest false claims by padraig o ceidigh which are sadly consistent with the false claims padraig o ceidigh recently made to irish entrepreneur magazine
896984 this is a great competition which i know our shoppers will enjoy
896985 we had a giant screen up for the launch on saturday and every one had great fun taking part in virtual olympic games
896986 well be presenting the lucky winners with prizes at the grand final when were looking forward to a great day with a live chinese dragon dance performance as well as free entertainment for children
896987 they were returning from the summit when an avalanche at the bottleneck hit them
896988 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain i panicked when a climber fell straight on to my back i was terrified that we would all be pulled off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff
896989 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country at gerard becoming the first irish person to scale k2 it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
896990 according to the rumours from the base camp there should be nine people dead and four still missing
896991 we were told that some climbers are still returning to the camps
896992 like all parents i face the challenge of keeping a youngster amused during the summer and would often spend money on toys to help keep him interested but like most parents i was dismayed at the amount of packaging and plastic that most high street shop toys contain
896993 i am conscious that most plastic that toys are made from cannot be recycled and once the child gets bored or breaks the toy it could spend up to 100 years in landfill
896994 the eco toys are also very interactive as if you build them in their original cardboard state you can have great fun with your child painting and decorating and making their space rocket exclusive to them
896995 this nation is like all the others that have been spewed upon the earth ready to shout for any cause that will tickle its vanity or fill its pocket what a hell of a heaven it will be when they get all these hypocrites assembled there
896996 revenue is a measure of the business going forward theyre in a battle for their life
896997 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
896998 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
896999 yes yes yes the atlanta braves have given you a championship listen to this crowd
897000 you have our permission to turn off the tv and go to bed now as long as you promise to patronize our sponsors
897001 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
897002 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
897003 i hope and pray hes sitting on a barstool somewhere with his dad arguing about baseball and his mom and his brother who he misses dearly i hope hes at peace because i know he wasnt the last couple years and he battled and fought and didnt do a whole lot of complaining he knew he wrote some checks that were getting cashed and he didnt complain about it once
897004 you know intellectually that youre exhausted but so what concentrate on the game i know this im not going to embarrass myself if i cant do this ill be the first to know it ive had a hell of a run so ive got nothing to complain about if i die tonight ive had a great life
897005 the bases are loaded again and i wish i was too
897006 ive just kind of grabbed on to the people of atlanta and theyve made me feel at home
897007 i wanted to be judged for my own ability my own style
897008 its like we were on the first wagon train west
897009 we didnt know where we were going but we were having a lot of fun getting there
897010 the people all over the country who send you christmas cards every year the people who when dad passed 5 000 of them sent notes or condolence cards when i lost my brother the people all over the country who sent condolence cards as well how do you thank those people and how do you say goodbye to those people
897011 we dont want to get all maudlin here but thank you folks and god bless you and were going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us
897012 ive got to be able to say ive worked with all of them
897013 i just hope i dont cry to be honest with you
897014 my dad always told me to be honest on the air and to be yourself dont try to be anybody else
897015 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
897016 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
897017 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
897018 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
897019 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
897020 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign a complete waste of the countrys time and attention and a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states

897025 we are waging a war on terror and now more than ever this border must be guarded
897026 the threat of potential terrorist infiltration across americas land and sea frontiers
897027 i want our country to be as welcoming in 2008 as when my grandfather came in the 1880s why do we think we have such ownership of this country now and its our country and no one elses
897028 we were created to share the gifts that were given to us
897029 listening to their story hearing what they have suffered these are the tired and poor and huddled masses
897030 we are catching a lot of women with children in their hands elderly folks you feel bad for them but youve still gotta do what youve gotta do
897031 people say to me they should not have crossed the borders they were breaking the law
897032 yes objectively a law was broken but when so many people are breaking that law because they cannot feed their families then maybe we have to adjust the immigration law just as we had to adjust the suffrage law or the segregation law
897033 selecting a small group of people causes such terror it causes families to be torn apart it causes people to lie whether or not they are guilty it deprives young people of an education i would never want another community to go through what postville has gone through
897034 im so sorry that youre going to have to leave and they say oh its all right it means theyve never been given much opportunity
897035 why do we think we have such ownership of this country now and its our country and no one elses
897036 we were created to share the gifts that were given to us
897037 yet again he mccain is more willing to put the interests of the health insurance industry
897038 it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to require employees to speak english while engaged in work
897039 not only does he often oversimplify the issues he actually seems to believe his oversimplifications
897040 are you better off than you were four years ago
897041 not that sen mccain is not an important figure but sen obama is either going to win or lose based on if americans decide if he can sit in the oval office
897042 clearly a myriad of polls are showing americans are skeptical especially when it comes to things like obamas ability to be commander in chief
897043 clearly the most beneficial playing field in my professional lifetime you have an incumbent president whose job approval ratings are in the 20s you have an economy that people feel is in recession whether or not it fits the technical definition
897044 there is a vast amount of defining going on here in 2008 at a much deeper level
897045 had benefiting him what barack obama does not have benefiting him which was an intensely organized highly focused and quite passionate set of essentially political action groups whose theme repetitive for the entire carter presidency was that we are weak the russians are strong

897166 al quran menasihati umat yahudi dan nasrani untuk tetap tenang tidak ada yang perlu mereka takutkan atau sesalkan selama mereka tetap setia pada kitab suci mereka tetapi di sisi lain al quran secara terang terangan menegaskan bahwa islamlah satu satunya keyakinan yang benar aneh bukan
897167 kenyataan yang patut disayangkan adalah syekh sneina mewakili arus utama islam pada masa kini anda bisa mendapati kesombongan orang yahudi terhadap rasnya tapi tidak banyak anda bisa menemukan orang kristen apokaliptik yang merasa benar sendiri dengan pendapatnya tentang akhir zaman tapi tetap saja dalam jumlah terbatas imam anda menjadi representasi dari sebagian besar kaum muslim setidaknya di sekitar sini

897178 kecuali sebagai suatu hukuman atas pembunuhan atau kejahatan lain di tanah mereka akan dianggap sebagai telah membunuh seluruh manusia di bumi
897179 pemerintahan as telah melakukan tindakan yang sangat tidak adil mengerikan dan jahat melalui dukungannya kepada pendudukan israel atas palestina disebabkan oleh kepatuhan mereka kepada yahudi kesombongan amerika serikat telah mencapai titik di mana mereka telah menduduki arabia tempat paling suci kaum muslim untuk tindakan ini dan tindakan tindakan tidak adil lainnya kami mengumumkan jihad kepada amerika serikat

897239 the k plussa reform started in spring 2007 has proceeded even better than expected there are now over half a million cooperation cards and the plussa special offer benefits granted in addition to the points will total over 200 million ahead of time during this year
897240 the plussa special offer benefits always amount to at least 10 we want to provide plussa customers with more and better benefits at checkouts as over 60 percent of cardholders prefer discounts granted at the checkout this came out in a survey conducted by tns gallup for the op pohjola group and the k group
897241 new cards have been issued at a steady rate more than 5 000 cards per week even during the summer there is an obvious demand for this kind of a card
897242 we believe that the growth rate will remain the same in the future
897243 it seems that the combination card increases the number of card payments at store checkouts and accordingly decreases the use of cash
897244 using the card gives customers two kinds of benefits plussa points and special offers at the own and plussa network stores and op bonuses for purchases paid with the visa card
897245 weve never seen a rush of business like this and certainly not for utilities

897247 we want to offer our customers alternatives they can choose whether to buy a product made of conventional or ecological cotton we created a clothing collection of our own that takes environmental values into account because in addition to the ecological approach it is important that we can determine ourselves the models colour schemes and measurements of the clothes provided we wanted the collection to combine a cheerful touch with scandinavian trendy features
897248 all clothing in the doogood collection has been produced with environmental aspects in mind from the start to the end even buttons are made from corozo nut instead of plastic as one of our premises was that the buttons are not allowed to contain plastic

897300 as i said the first time this story appeared here
897301 there isnt much consumer confidence compared to last year usually at the end of the financial year people are rushing around buying it products then august settles into a quieter month
897302 price dropping components hasnt helped pick up more customers they arent confident in buying products because they might want to save for the future
897303 past six years ago computer and it spending has been growing and growing maybe what we are seeing now is a drop in the number of it products being bought and it might pick up again hopefully sooner rather than later
897304 theres not too much we can do at the moment things started to slow down probably when the new financial year started if not a bit before then

897318 we have evolved to a much higher standard and they just could not have been smarter than us
897319 we dont have shelters that are being stocked with food were not doing this for the public my only conclusion is that theyre stocking up for themselves
897320 unprecedented demand cleans out major storable food supplier through 2009
897321 it came to our attention today that the worlds largest producer of storable foods mountain house is currently out of stock of all 10 cans of freeze dried foods not just the turkey tetrazzini they will not have product now through 2009
897322 this information was learned by a mountain house dealer who shared it with me this morning
897323 mountain house claims this situation is due to a backlog of orders which may very well be true but who is purchasing all of their food this is a massive global corporation
897324 one idea the military tensions are ramping up with iran and news segments debate whether or not we will implement a preemptive strike in conjunction with israel
897325 i think that families should be prepared for times of crisis whether its a man made disaster or a natural disaster and i think its wise and prudent to stock up on food
897326 the bottom line is there there will be a period of time when a lot of the planet will be flooded and we will need to get to caves in higher ground if you are on a spiritual path you will be guided and those guys will probably drown lol
897327 political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind

897337 i cant imagine israel being recognized without kippah hebrew language and bible
897338 it has been a big mistake not to deal with the issue of the palestinian refugees
897339 in any case it is clear that ever since several people left netanyahus bureau in the wake of publication of the full winograd report at the end of january the dam has burst and the stories are flowing this would not have happened to former prime minister ariel sharon and he didnt travel the world like a backpacker either
897340 for edward said what we are talking about is a process in which the audience the public can absorb something that is fairly complex whether it is referred to as music literature or history
897341 sounds perfectly right except the title which should have been
897342 the girls are in much more serious trouble due mostly to their naivete and their education from home thus they get into trouble more easily and their problems are very serious
897343 we are talking about girls aged 17 25 who because they have nowhere to sleep will go home with a man just so they have a roof over their heads
897344 there is a real problem in locating homeless teenage girls
897345 many of them are picked up by men who take advantage of them making them sell their bodies in order to survive that means that in many cases the girls cannot be found out on the streets at night but often find shelter in the outlets of the sex industry
897346 public slander to raise incitement against them quite a few tendentious attempts dont listen to these claims they are based on misinformation and deception the reality is very far from what is described
897347 israel can be proud of an independent and professional system
897348 i cant imagine israel being recognized without kippah hebrew language and bible
897349 we remain committed to the egyptian mediation efforts however we have suspended the talks on schalit for two reasons one because the israeli enemy has not abided by the terms of the cease fire agreement and two because the rafah border crossing remains closed
897350 this is a tragic ending for the families of eldad regev and ehud goldwasser but also a bad ending to the war on terror
897351 we have become the only country in the world willing to release terrorists in return for dead bodies
897352 you israelis dont have enough money to build more cells send our civilians back we palestinians all have hearts and it all started after your israelis violently treated us
897353 we slanted the news towards a withdrawal from lebanon because we had sons there shelly yechimovich now a labor party knesset member ed and i pushed in every way possible the withdrawal from lebanon towards 2000 i have no doubt that we promoted an agenda of withdrawal that was a matter of public dispute
897354 you determine the daily agenda and you have the power the problem is that in your profession it cant be dealt with properly and ethically without civil courage you have the power so use it also to ensure that there is freedom of speech of course with the limitation that you must act ethically and not create hostile public opinion because there is nothing that affects freedom of speech more than hostile public opinion
897355 ehud barak is the last person who should talk about envelopes containing cash
897356 a ceasefire agreement without gilad schalit is a moral crime that conveys the message of abandoning the kidnapped soldier to his fate
897357 if i were hamas pm i would use this golden opportunity
897358 my problem has been that as much as i cared for those miserable palestinian kids the same poor israeli kids constantly hooked my attention i suffer from more problem when the jewish pigs are the only group that points out their gloomy situation and howls for the equal treatment and therefore outsiders are hardly willing to hear the voice of israel and hardly know the real situation inside barenboims israel
897359 hamas has not changed its skin these are bloodthirsty and despicable terrorists who even today are doing all they can to harm israeli civilians hamas is the address in gaza and it carries responsibility for everything that happens in gaza
897360 this is not a peace agreement there is an understanding that is based on the effectiveness of military activities until now and the will to stop it
897361 a ceasefire agreement without gilad schalit is a moral crime that conveys the message of abandoning the kidnapped soldier to his fate
897362 if i were hamas pm i would use this golden opportunity
897363 pa was going to accept bibis offer which is a tiny part of what olmert is doing now
897364 we live in a very open environment in the family where everyone is entitled to have his own position and thats fine with us i never questioned their right to be wrong there is a complex dialogue between my children and me there are a lot of disagreements and anger but they have influenced me and i am proud of it i would like to believe that i have also influenced them unlike some candidates i have never used my family to advance my career what do they expect to gain by saying that my two sons emigrated from israel my wife is unique she engages in a million things there are many institutions for children at risk for battered women for culture and art that exist only thanks to her of course my wife and children influenced me aliza and i have a special bond only a dumb person can say that being in love with one person for 35 years living with him being married to him will not influence his point of view i always admired the tolerance of my family they tolerated my dissension for the family consensus they never got rid of me in spite of my different positions
897365 but i must admit i did it with a certain amount of hesitation
897366 then it was not just a matter of differing ideologies he set about creating a new reality on the ground to which i was totally opposed when i heard his nationalist speeches his desire to rule over the whole of jerusalem at all costs i found it very difficult i have never been able to accept this rhetoric about historic holy jerusalem as our eternal united capital
897367 but religious zionist leaders charged prime minister ehud olmert with caving in to haredi pressure
897368 well this is not a car of the wife of a prime minister we should take it to the garage tomorrow
897369 i saw mk x and mk y risking their life during the war then why they are not willing to sacrifice their political life in this hardest time like this
897370 do not do unto others what you would not want others to do to you
897371 olmert wears snazzy suits that sit well on his athletic physique
897372 ill never smoke a cigar in the prime ministers office
897373 in the israeli ethos national leaders are expected to live modestly to the point of poverty
897374 while one can understand why the settlers are rubbing their hands with glee it is not clear why leftists are urging labor to pull the plug on olmert let them not be so sure about how their demands will turn out and who will come to power in the end
897375 when i decided to start my mailing to knesset there was one belief in my mind my only problem was with the right winged secular aggressive opinions
897376 when an old fashioned arab guy lived in french colony
897377 the systems here are out of kilter the supreme court has expanded its authority has overflowed both into the realm of the knesset and into the realm of the government and has become accustomed the new flawed situation in such a way that every suitable attempt to repair it looks to it like a blow israel is on its way to a police state members of the government and members of the knesset are subordinated in effect to the attorney general who acts under the protection of the courts this is the anti democratic revolution that is taking place under the banner of the law
897378 while one can understand why the settlers are rubbing their hands with glee it is not clear why female mks and their male clones are urging labor to pull the plug on olmert
897379 let them not be so sure about how their demands will turn out and who will come to power in the end
897380 i dont know if the level of corruption in government institutions has risen
897381 however it is bad enough that governmental institutions are seen as corrupt by the public one must bear in mind that not all inappropriate behavior constitutes a criminal offense
897382 its a scandal that lawyers are represented on the committee when they must appear before the judges they appoint
897383 the girls are in much more serious trouble due mostly to their naivete and their education from home thus they get into trouble more easily and their problems are very serious
897384 elem cannot deal with this problem by itself we are the voice of troubled israeli youth and will raise awareness to the plight of youth at risk but this is an issue for all of israeli society we are talking about girls aged 17 25 who because they have nowhere to sleep will go home with a man just so they have a roof over their heads
897385 there is a real problem in locating homeless teenage girls
897386 many of them are picked up by men who take advantage of them making them sell their bodies in order to survive that means that in many cases the girls cannot be found out on the streets at night but often find shelter in the outlets of the sex industry
897387 israel can be proud of an independent and professional system
897388 i dont know if the level of corruption in government institutions has risen however it is bad enough that governmental institutions are seen as corrupt by the public one must bear in mind that not all inappropriate behavior constitutes a criminal offense

897391 my problem has been that as much as i cared for those miserable palestinian kids the same poor israeli kids constantly hooked my attention i suffer from more problem when the jewish pigs are the only group that points out their gloomy situation and howls for the equal treatment and therefore outsiders are hardly willing to hear the voice of israel and hardly know the real situation inside barenboims israel
897392 hamas has not changed its skin these are bloodthirsty and despicable terrorists who even today are doing all they can to harm israeli civilians hamas is the address in gaza and it carries responsibility for everything that happens in gaza
897393 this is not a peace agreement there is an understanding that is based on the effectiveness of military activities until now and the will to stop it
897394 a ceasefire agreement without gilad schalit is a moral crime that conveys the message of abandoning the kidnapped soldier to his fate

897415 theyve been very clever about designing chemical instruments that make a lot of sense and should give us a reasonable level of accuracy
897416 and thats not an easy exercise when youre doing it 100 million miles away

897420 the ipa would traverse the arctic to find an eskimo allergic to snow if it thought it would further their ideological arguments
897421 the ipa is opposed to fair trade because they fear that making the market fairer and more accessible for poor people would disadvantage big business despite members of the business community welcoming fair trade
897422 it is an ideologically driven argument that the ipa has failed to successfully prosecute despite many attempts and the accc has again rejected their claims
897423 this is the second time the ipa has made baseless claims about fair trade to the accc and the accc has again indicated that based on all the information to hand they again do not intend to take any action
897424 the aim of fair trade is to help poor communities around the world get a fair price for their product
897425 the ipa has made it their business to try to source an exception to the rule and find people in developing countries who have not benefited from fair trade

897467 suddenly i saw a clearing in the dark drive ahead and a patch of sky and in a moment the dark trees had thinned the nameless shrubs had disappeared and on either side of us was a wall of colour blood red reaching far above our heads we were amongst the rhododendrons there was something bewildering even shocking about the suddenness of their discovery the woods had not prepared me for them they startled me with their crimson faces massed one upon the other in incredible profusion showing no leaf no twig nothing but the slaughterous red luscious and fantastic unlike any rhododendron plant i had every seen before
897468 we were not far from the house now i saw the drive broaden to the sweep i had expected and with the blood red wall still flanking on either side we turned the last corner and so came to manderley yes there it was the manderley i had expected the manderley of my picture post card long ago a thing of grace and beauty exquisite and faultless lovelier even than i had ever dreamed built in its hollow of smooth grassland and mossy lawns the terraces sloping to the gardens and the gardens to the sea as we drove up to the wide stone steps and stopped before the open door i saw through one of the mullioned windows that the hall was full of people

897474 shirley is charlotte brontes only historical novel and her most topical one written at the time of social unrest it is set during the period of the napoleonic wars when economic hardship led to riots in the woollen district of yorkshire a mill owner robert moore is determined to introduce new machinery despite fierce opposition from his workers he ignores their suffering and puts his own life at risk robert sees marriage to the wealthy shirley keeldar as the solution to his difficulties but he loves his cousin caroline she suffers misery and frustration and shirley has her own ideas about the man she will choose to marry the friendship between the two women and the contrast between their situations is at the heart of this compelling novel which is suffused with brontes deep yearning for an earlier time
897475 like most first novels it lays out what will be its authors lasting preoccupations the three or four families in a country village which austen told her niece in an oft quoted letter was the very thing to work on the interlocking anxieties over marriages estates and ecclesiastical livings the secrets deceptions and self deceptions that take several hundred pages to straighten out to the extent that they get straightened out the radical skepticism about human knowledge human communication and human possibility that informs almost every scene right up to the sort of happy ending and the distinctive characters the negligent or overindulgent parents the bifurcating siblings smart sister beautiful sister serious brother coxcomb brother the charming corrupted libertines unlike most first novels though sense and sensibility doesnt need our indulgence its good to go

897493 lets be clear that any territory that will be added to the present armm will only be because of a plebiscite or after a plebiscite that could only be conducted after congress has enacted an enabling law to do it
897494 there is no surrender of territory here that is why we are providing for a plebiscite which is consulting the people if we have to put some additional geographic areas into what is now the armm
897495 so theres no talk here of territory loss or sovereignty loss
897496 the moa is a preliminary agreement before we go to the final peace talks or the formal peace talks therefore it is not the final agreement that should bind us to all the agreements
897497 it is a preliminary document together with the ceasefire arrangements the rehabilitation and construction provisions and now the moa ad these are the preliminaries before we go to the formal peace talks
897498 in fact one of the provisions a major provision of the moa is that all provisions must conform with the constitution or the legal framework of the land
897499 theres nothing to fear here it is not confiscatory as some people would now want to tell the people in zamboanga or cotabato no lands will be given to the moslems titles will be respected licenses will be respected
897500 as soon as we get that signed we can start all these consultations and all the debate and i believe that by going through this we can have a better position and better results for the peace process
897501 im willing to go there again and discuss it again consult with them
897502 this is not ramming peace through the throat of the people of north cotabato we are all for peace if i fought in cotabato it is because we wanted peace in cotabato and other parts of mindanao
897503 there is one line which says that it cannot go against the republic
897504 this is not the stage that will solve all these many questions that are raised now before the public because there is a last and final stage which is the negotiation of the comprehensive compact
897505 i would appeal to those who are opposing now or those who put a doubt that the real issues will be faced in the comprehensive compact after the signing of the moa
897506 its a memorandum only of agreement for ancestral domain because the framework agreement although it moa ad can stand on its own needs also a transition process that will be contained in the negotiation of the compact agreement so let us wait for that stage and we can go public and we can debate
897507 it will reportedly authorize the bje to sign trade pacts friendship treaties and other international agreements with foreign countries and send representatives to asean and the united nations
897508 you cannot divide sovereignty which the moa provides for when it allows bje to exercise shared authority and responsibility with the philippine government over the bangsamoro homeland
897509 this moa goes beyond the constitutional parameters and boundaries which provides only for autonomous regions i am for the granting of full and genuine authority to the autonomous region for muslim mindanao armm but the process should not violate the constitution
897510 this is the first time that ive seen a document as such you have all the elements of a state
897511 that entitles the bangsamoro to a self declaration of independence because its all there youve been recognized you have territory you have self determination your ancestral domain is your birthright its not part of the public domain
897512 it is essential to lay the foundation of the bangsamoro homeland in order to address the bangsamoro peoples humanitarian and economic needs as well as their political aspirations
897513 you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free

897519 i am still finding it hard to believe that he did all of this
897520 i have never ever thought that he was capable of killing these women and i cannot believe it now i cannot see him strangling a girl naked and taking her down a road in a car and chucking her in a ditch he could not kill a rabbit
897521 if he was a violent boy and in trouble with the police all the time then i could understand it but he was not like that he was just a normal boy full of mischief and that is why despite all of the evidence against him i cannot see him doing it
897522 he has had his court case and he has been refused an appeal before it seems to me that it is what prisoners do once they are found guilty and receive a life sentence they just come up with these appeals and it seems like a hobby for prisoners wasting peoples time
897523 but i hope that he gets another hearing if it happens i will be there i want to go and see what he thinks a fair trial is but if i get close to him he will probably run a mile when he sees me i will look at him and see if he looks at me if he is guilty he will not enter the room
897524 i was given a seat with the families in the main court room but i did not want to sit next to the men and women whose daughters had been murdered so i sat in the annexe with the media
897525 it was unbelievable what he was coming out with about his sexual habits especially when they said he was going golfing and then going to a massage parlour and paying them 60 but that he could get it cheaper from girls on the streets
897526 i just could not believe that he was doing that just think if i had been sitting in that other court room with the families when he was spouting all of this
897527 he stood up in court and said he was driving around the red light district in the early hours of the morning because he could not sleep but that is rubbish as far as i am concerned he also said he was laying the girls on his jacket on the floor of the bedroom having sex with them but i do not believe that for a start
897528 it could be possible that he did the norwich ones girls were killed in norwich that have never been found and clothes from the girls murdered in ipswich have never been found so if someone can hide bodies that can never be found then they can hide clothes
897529 if he admits to me that he is guilty of the ipswich murders then it is possible i suppose but what you are saying is that i have sat here in my home talking to somebody who has committed murder two or three times if he had murdered those girls from norwich how can he come and sit here and watch tv and come to the cricket with me i cannot see it
897530 what i said was that i would probably feel the same as the victims families if my daughter was killed and some of them said he should be hanged but i also said that that could be the easy way out maybe life in prison is more of a punishment
897531 everybody treats me well people seem to go out of their way to be nice i get fussed a lot of the time maybe it is because people feel pity for me
897532 i went to court to find out the truth and i have got to accept how it finished
897533 he is gone i have got to believe what happened and that there is nothing i can do to change that but i will never believe he was capable of doing it unless he tells me himself
897534 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
897535 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
897536 theyre so easily spooked the labor government have such a lack of confidence in themselves
897537 peter costello made clear that hes not available for the leadership and that remains the case he did that the day after the election
897538 he flagged he was thinking about the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family and im sure thats what hes doing
897539 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
897540 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
897541 he hasnt got blokes knocking on doors and if he has he has studiously avoided knocking on my door
897542 there were very few people making comment to me about peter costello and why he isnt making a decision
897543 if he wants to put his name forward for the leadership and launch a challenge theres a process for that if he does decide that he needs to let the partyroom know that and we will decide who the leader is

897573 the timing of the lecture where chief justice pius langa spoke which was attended by judge chris nicholson the presiding judge in the zuma application and his two assessors coupled with the timing of the ruling of the constitutional court on thursday and the apparent mobilisation of the judiciary is worrying for us
897574 the constitutional courts judgment was vindictive because when langa says judges must be harsh on those who are trying to evade the courts he was actually setting a precedent and this compromises peoples rights
897575 it is not merely coincidence that this lecture was held on the eve of the trial what was pius langa coming to do give instructions through a lecture

897587 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
897588 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
897589 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

897601 if we can provide that well help them have a better quality of life through access to health care
897602 when you ask the fox to take care of the chickens in the henhouse thats an issue
897603 otherwise its not really indigent health care its indigent sick care
897604 for fall 2008 the chicest bevvy on the block will undoubtedly be coke light in bottles designed by cavalli
897605 any unwritten information that is not commonly known by others within a company
897606 its amazing what sorts of things happen all around without ever going noticed
897607 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
897608 real estate has beaten down no doubt but probably from an investment point of view its not showing any sort of breakout but from a trading point of view i think so i think it is unfortunate that two stocks make the majority of the index but one of them is really breaking out which is dlf even from a recent low of rs 350 above rs 500 thats still close to a 50 pullback from the lows so dlf is bringing the trading strength back in it
897609 since dlf has already moved maybe you will probably want to look for something else i think the second best would obviously be unitech again because of the weightage it has in the index so go with unitech it has consolidated a lot in the rs 150 160 range its just broken out on friday above rs 168 its broken above a trend line so i think it may go back and retest a little bit on the downside but range of rs 168 150 is an accumulation zone for me i think the stock is headed towards rs 190 210 levels eventually
897610 there are maybe more trading opportunities in the four wheelers not investment very similar to real estate one will get trading bounces of 3 5 but i am not sure whether you will get investment bounce backs the two wheeler is suggesting more strength and even the numbers reflect that so from an investment point to view i am more with the two wheelers but for trading maybe a tata motors its beaten down and one can get a trading move rs 398 374 would be a buying range and target is rs 429 439 but here i would definitely be very strict on my stoplosses and rs 370 would be a strict stoploss
897611 hdfc banks q1fy09 results were largely in line with our expectations on a reported basis the numbers are not exactly comparable as q1fy09 results are for the merged entity on a like to like basis the nii growth remained robust however growth in non interest income was muted as a certain area of business of the erstwhile cbop was discontinued resulting in lower fee income growth the merger related issues improvement in casa deposits and asset quality and rationalization of cost income ratio would take at least 2 3 quarters to be addressed and following that the full impact of the merger would be visible
897612 we have revised our estimates to include the impact of the merger and have changed our target price for the stock we now value hdfc bank at rs 1331 using the ddm model we have also changed the assumption of the risk free rate from 8 7 to 9 1 at this price the stock would trade at a p abv of 3 1x we reiterate our buy recommendation on the stock
897613 kamanwala housing construction is a real estate company located in bombay it is doing most of the projects in bombay only this company was not doing well till about the year 2006 the company saw a turnaround in performance in financial year 2006 07 wherein the revenues of the company grew six fold from about rs 12 crore to rs 80 crore to rs 85 crore and the pat increased from about rs 50 lakh to about rs 12 5 crore that was the starting point for this company and from there on this company has maintained its performance and has given good performance qoq
897614 this company is doing projects mainly in bombay some of the projects which it is doing in bombay are one is the commercial project called pinnacle corporate park which it is doing at bkc bandra kurla complex this is about 75 000 sq ft and besides that this company is doing a residential project in malad west having a total saleable area of about 4 lakh sq ft and in the first phase it is doing about 2 lakh sq ft it is also doing a residential project in santacruz west which is about 60 000 sq ft it has also bought a building called vallabh terraces in opera house in bombay and it is doing re development of this building and will probably sell this building after the re development it is also doing a commercial and residential project in versova in bombay and also developing the famous filmistan studio into a residential cum commercial project
897615 it has about 8 9 lakh sq ft of area from bombay alone and besides that the company has bought land in new bombay also it has bought about 10 000 meters of land at a total consideration of about rs 15 crore it is going to develop a residential and commercial project there also to de risk the business model it has diversified to hyderabad also where in it has taken about 20 stake in a project which is spread over an area of about 35 acres
897616 for fy08 this company has achieved the sales of rs 96 crore the pat is of about rs 24 5 crore its got a small equity of about rs 6 4 crore which translates into an eps of rs 40 for fy07 08 in the first quarter also the performance has been maintained there the topline is increased about 92 to about rs 33 crore and the bottom line is up by about 37 to rs 4 25 crore you may say that when the real estate market is bad and most analysts are predicting that the real estate prices might correct in bombay why this stock the reason this is trading at very reasonable valuations it is going at a pe ratio of less than 2 5
897617 the promoters have been increasing their stake for the past few quarters they have increased their stake from about 40 to about 45 through the preferential route the one which gives about confidence of sustainability of earnings is that the company has recently declared a bonus in 1 1 ratio declaring a bonus in an industry which most people perceive not doing well that only gives and talks about the confidence which the promoters have when talking about the sustainability of the earnings in future so this stock is trading at a reasonable valuation and it is available cum bonus and dividend which is of 25 also the promoters increasing their stake at a market cap of rs 60 crore this stock looks undervalued
897618 metal is likely to be volatile that is one sector which we are bearish i think this rally in the market is going to be led by a commodity fall so any pullback on the upside this is the sector we are not going to touch major within the sector jindal saw hasnt moved up much so between rs 550 to around rs 490 an rs 50 band one could buy around rs 595 635 could be the target on the upside that is one stock which looks okay on a trading bet but if one is looking for investment opportunities within the sector then i think one will be disappointed after a brief rally this sector is going to collapse again that could lead the next leg of the market down so be careful on the upside
897619 positive outlook for coke and ferro chrome prices along with the re start of the pig iron facility should enable the company to deliver strong financial results in fy2009 additional contribution from the 300 000 sponge iron and 50 mw power plants are expected to flow from q2 fy2009 onwards thereby significantly enhancing the revenue and earnings outlook for visa steel
897620 moreover the upcoming captive linkage for raw materials will improve operational efficiencies
897621 the pricing power of the cement companies have been going away because the capacity addition is much more than the consumption growth which we have been seeing or the demand growth which we have been seeing so thats a reason that all the performance of cement companies for june quarter has not been to the expectation on the other hand the costs of production for the companies are also going up in case of acc though the turnover is marginally up whatever the expansion in bottomline can only come by increase in the capacity utilisation or in the form of the higher turnover so i think overall the cement sector may not give a good performance for the time being a hold is given on the stock but above rs 600 one can think of existing from the stock
897622 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
897623 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
897624 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
897625 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
897626 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
897627 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
897628 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
897629 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
897630 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
897631 o modo como tem ocorrido o lan amento dessas candidaturas reitera a fragmenta o do movimento comunit rio
897632 na poca nadinho deixou bem claro que estava indo para o dem porque o prefeito cesar maia prometeu recursos para obras na sua comunidade
897633 o poder p blico entra de cabe a e faz das comunidades a sua principal forma de atua o inclusive com um controle da c mara onde parlamentares votam recursos oficiais para manter seus currais eleitorais
897634 na primeira gest o do prefeito cesar maia foram estabelecidos crit rios t cnicos para definir que reas seriam contempladas pelo projeto depois o que passou a vigorar foram as barganhas com lideran as comunit rias
897635 a autoriza o para candidatos de fora fazerem suas campanhas nas favelas negociada de v rias formas pode ser assist ncia social ou obras mas h quem cobre em dinheiro entre r 350 e r 35 mil
897636 as comunidades est o cansadas de candidatos copa do mundo que s aparecem de quatro em quatro anos em acari por exemplo participei da organiza o de um plebiscito em que foram escolhidos os candidatos da rea vejo isso como um ponto positivo
897637 o mais interessante que candidatos de mil cias costumam ser de partidos da direita enquanto nas reas onde h tr fico h uma identifica o maior com os de esquerda
897638 l deres comunit rios cada vez mais deixam de ser cabos eleitorais para tentar se eleger fato que j incomoda bastante os pol ticos tradicionais porque est o perdendo seus antigos currais
897639 its one small paragraph in a much much bigger bill
897640 but it means a lot to doctors in guilford county and their patients
897641 i dont want to get too excited because there still is some chance gov easley would veto it
897642 we never opposed the concept of tax free drug samples in our tax department
897643 but we just wanted to be certain we complied with the state department of revenues directive and state law i think theres a lot of momentum for this new bill to become law we will certainly do whatever state law says
897644 weve had just slews of calls as you can imagine
897645 the passing of this senate bill its very positive for the patients and very positive for the medical practices of guilford county were very pleased
897646 uninsured and underinsured we have untold numbers of people whose lives could depend on free samples
897647 it is my hope that because the amendment was actually more of a clarification and especially since it was spoken about as a clarification on the floors of the house and senate that eagle should not have to pay that tax because it was never the intent
897648 this is something that will be discussed at length by the state department of revenue
897649 one small amendment among something like 13 pages worth of bill
897650 i didnt know that was out there and im glad we have abolished it
897651 come dec 1 i think its pretty clear where the law stands
897652 i hope we are done with it but with the electronic world were in today i dont know if youre ever done with these video poker situations so well just have to keep a watchful eye on that
897653 the oil sector has been a clear out performer maybe because of strength of reliance and a huge recovery in ongc and oil marketing companies but they have run up already essar oil which was a star performer in the last bull run did not give up much on the downside from rs 300 to just about rs 160 on the downside is currently around rs 200 i would like one to buy it between rs 200 and rs 180 levels for a target of roughly rs 215 on the upside a pure trading bet but that looks the best as of now because it is currently breaking out around the rs 198 levels

897659 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
897660 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
897661 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

897663 video games in 2006 are the cultural equivalent of rock music in 1967
897664 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
897665 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
897666 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
897667 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
897668 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
897669 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
897670 this is not a complete list of the works i consulted
897671 can you make time in your life to enjoy a nonpareil writers reveries his cascading engagement with worlds weve lost

897674 wanted for example to investigate why one should hold fast to a religion not because it was true but because it was the faith of ones fathers was faith not faith but simple family habit maybe there was no true religion
897675 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
897676 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
897677 if you could save me from the ranks of the freaks who suspect they could never love anyone
897678 i thought my life would be different somehow i thought my life would be better by now
897679 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
897680 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
897681 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
897682 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
897683 kept him from being a bad man and part of what made him a stupid one
897684 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
897685 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
897686 when i was at georgia tech we played georgia and i loved that game thats what gets the crowds going
897687 anytime you play a border state theres going to be a rivalry and thats good for your program virginia is always a big game but their rivalry is with virginia tech
897688 i was thinking about a fighting terp decal id like to have an academic one and a football one for example if you dont get to class then i take the academic one off
897689 maybe sitting in the omelet line for 30minutes will motivate them to go to class a little more
897690 were one of the last to get going here but i think its going to be really nice
897691 were going to lower the field and put fieldturf in and make the seats behind the bench a little more premium and then were going to redo our locker room
897692 this year what im trying to do is invite our lettermen to join us in terrapin alley let the lettermen walk before us and let the people recognize some of the players who have been here in the past
897693 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
897694 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
897695 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
897696 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
897697 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
897698 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
897699 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
897700 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
897701 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
897702 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
897703 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
897704 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
897705 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
897706 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
897707 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
897708 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
897709 you know all those songs youre yelling out yeah we actually played those
897710 watch the migrants smoke in the old orange grove and the red rocket blaze over cape canaveral
897711 in the morning when the sun rises look in the water see the blue sky as if heaven has been laid there at our feet
897712 theres money lenders inside the temple that circus tiger is gonna break your heart something so wild turned into paper if i loved you well thats my fault
897713 but even western medicine it couldnt save danny callahan that bone marrow a bald little boy
897714 i dont wanna die in the hospital i dont wanna die in the hospital i dont wanna die in the hospital you gotta take me back outside
897715 help me get my boots on help me get my boots on help me get my boots back on
897716 gone gone to new york city where you gonna go with a head that empty
897717 bored as hell like a little baby at the bottom of a well
897718 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
897719 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
897720 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
897721 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
897722 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
897723 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
897724 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
897725 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
897726 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
897727 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
897728 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
897729 in addition to reducing mortality we during that same period had no instances of congestive heart failure or patients in cardiogenic shock and normally it ran 10 to 20 percent
897730 decisions are being made in the field rather than having to go through the emergency department to have all that repeated
897731 i didnt know it was actually turning in the lock
897732 maybe ill try to park it off campus and take a bus
897733 its a challenge for the other end of the spectrum
897734 there is no want of power in god to cast wicked men into hell
897735 you look and act like you just stepped out of the 18th century
897736 like ive never done it before im not a cookie cutter
897737 we had get deep into the woods moore says during a day off wearing regular work clothes and cowboy boots
897738 if i have to single out one that im more alike in character and look alike its probably gen daniel morgan
897739 well he lost something off the back of the trailer
897740 maybe whats so funny about peace love and understanding holt told scoop
897741 its the things behind the scenes that literally keep us propped up
897742 sometimes on rare occasions we try to get things right
897743 if we absolutely had to get things right about the city we could go to juanita
897744 the setup in the managers office doesnt give the mayor or the council enough support in a town that is going from a small town to a big city
897745 w the new film from oliver stone about our president george w bush
897746 what are you cut out for partying chasing tail driving drunk who do you think you are a kennedy youre a bush act like one
897747 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
897748 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
897749 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
897750 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
897751 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us
897752 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
897753 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
897754 if it keeps raining we win it didnt and we got seventh
897755 it seemed like our car was an eighth to 10th place car the majority of the day
897756 after the red it seemed like our car came into it a lot more the longer we went there we finally got running with the guys that ran up front all day
897757 that was a great feeling to be doing that again when you get in a slump like weve been in this year when you have had nine years of success its easy to take it for granted days like today remind you how much you appreciate having a good day
897758 i can promise you that we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were done to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me
897759 you dont want to mess up the other three teams but were still working on it and i think well get it done in the next couple of weeks
897760 i dont think any of us really plan for it because were all coaches first
897761 you need to be a problem solver so that the players and coaches can just focus on playing
897762 weve come into august before without a good feel on our starters
897763 because in football theyve always said if you got one you got none
897764 i want us to mesh better as an offensive line
897765 trey bailey has been taught by steve and is a great player very athletic now were all ready to get out there
897766 you never know who will get the ball im rooting for him hopefully he can pull out rookie of the year as well
897767 hes a really bright guy but sometimes he almost gives you the appearance of being too cool for school
897768 we need him to grind a bit and to be less of a rock star one of my coaches used to say that some guys are artists not painters we need alex to be just a worker
897769 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
897770 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
897771 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
897772 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
897773 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
897774 os crimes as not cias o medo tudo isso confina as pessoas e altera comportamentos preciso tratamento porque sair sozinho desses traumas dif cil
897775 um deles apontou a arma para meu marido e levou tudo
897776 ele presenciou tudo e ficou questionando por que os assaltantes fizeram aquilo se estavam com fome se eram maus
897777 eles n o podem evitar que sejam v timas mas encontram no medo antecipado a defesa para a viol ncia
897778 a maioria nem sabe que tem trauma j que os sintomas s o comuns a outras doen as um paciente descobriu depois da terapia que a sudorese suor excessivo que tinha em uma das m os surgiu do trauma de ter sido tocado por um bandido

897786 i was planning to play in japan but maybe now i change my plans and play in america
897787 the survey results show just how big a problem lack of sleep can be for some people and the havoc it can wreak on our personal lives

897791 i can only promise that we will only start work if we have complete permission of the court and the people
897792 my sister has totally lost it she is also a victim and cannot understand that she does not get any help from anyone
897793 by changing how people think and how they behave we can change how they invest in sustainable buildings
897794 we were expecting the prime minister of canada to do the right thing the right thing was like the chinese head tax
897795 an important evolution in canada s relationship with our first peoples
897796 all of the genetic components are exactly the same in mice as in people
897797 as fellow mammals humans share many physiological anatomical and metabolic parallels with mice
897798 im an artist so i did this picture of the kind of transitional species i would like to see if i did see it i would believe in evolution instantly
897799 everything good has a little bad in it and everything bad has a little good in it
897800 tenemos el arte para que la verdad no nos mate
897801 master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind
897802 neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him
897803 you are right it was satans fault i am sorry for blaming you
897804 i know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee
897805 that ancient figment concerning the intercourse of angels with women is abundantly refuted by its own absurdity and it is surprising that learned men should formerly have been fascinated by ravings so gross and prodigious the opinion also of the chaldean paraphrase is frigid namely that promiscuous marriages between the sons of nobles and the daughters of plebeians is condemned moses then does not distinguish the sons of god from the daughters of men because they were of dissimilar nature or of different origin but because they were the sons of god by adoption whom he had set apart for himself while the rest remained in their original condition
897806 whatsoever the lord pleased that he did in heaven and in the earth in the seas and all the deep places
897807 boyd for some reason wont accept the fact that the infirmities in this world are from god
897808 it would only make sense that god sent them because man broke gods covenant god is the judge strikes man down with a curse death disease etc are all curses of the covenant
897809 my contention is that natural evil can only be adequately explained if we accept that fallen spirits have to some degree corrupted nature
897810 if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal
897811 how can you be a christian and be a muslim at the same time
897812 i dont think its possible to be both just like you cant be a republican and a democrat
897813 jesus christ is the son of god and redeemer of sinful humanity
897814 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven
897815 i contend that animal suffering is an evil that needs to be accounted for by theists who believe that god is all good and all powerful
897816 governs all creatures actions and things from greatest even to the least
897817 is an evil that should be avoided and remedied when possible
897818 if we accept that god is the creator of nature and if its true that nature sometimes often makes animals suffer then it seems we have to either a hold that god is responsible for animal suffering hence not all good b hold that god is all good but animal suffering is necessary or c hold that free agents are responsible for animal suffering
897819 i am not sure what exactly boyd would say of that passage but he just might say that that passage is relating to us gods perfect knowledge of the present
897820 i love to hunt and fish and i have inflicted suffering on many pikes and walleyes was that evil
897821 animal suffering is necessary only in respect of gods general decree of providence
897822 change his mind terminoligy i think gods initial secret decree came to pass you mistake gods revealed decree for his secret decree i e what god says to his people vs what he has decreed from all eternity
897823 i do not doubt your sincerity for the lord or service to god
897824 i have met people who have told me that calvinism has turn them off towards god and theyve left the church i e calvinism has led some people towards hell hmmm wait that just means they arent predestined right likewise why worry about people being led to hell at mr boyds church if they dont have any choice in it anyway
897825 i love adolf hitler he so sound in his thinking and love for his country
897826 jesus could blast others like the pharisees because he knows their hearts we dont have that luxury nor do i believe that weve been put on earth for this task
897827 obviously if you see nothing wrong with it after prayer then disregard this note i could totally be wrong
897828 there is a way which seems right to man but its end is the way of death
897829 i challenge you to find a biblical definition of the gospel of christ and see if various churches you dissagree with theologically are preaching this gospel if not then i would agree that is a false gospel but if a church has some funny ideas about baptism or sacriments or hierarchy and is still preaching christ cruisified for the forgiveness of sins alone then let them alone
897830 i do not doubt your sincerity for the lord or service to god
897831 a groundbreaking survey from an unlikely source backs up what family groups have been saying about kids all along and reveals teens are on the right track when it comes to their role models family and sex this is truly good news
897832 identity of 129 deceased has been known and their bodies were handed over to their relatives efforts are on to identify the remaining 17 bodies
897833 the punjab government is providing all kind of assistance to the relatives of victims for transportation of bodies from bhai jaitta civil hospital here
897834 for us smoking in any public place is an offence i have no idea if there is going to be any special drive in october
897835 since the order has to be implemented we are trying to inform them in advance smokers will find it irritating and difficult to accept initially many might even prefer not to visit bars but things will eventually settle down
897836 they were repeatedly asked not to telecast provocative and inflammatory content
897837 the administration had earlier issued notices to the channels but they kept on transmitting highly objectionable and provocative material
897838 but since the two channels are also cable service providers without signal separators the transmission of other channels was disrupted
897839 earlier the kite strings were coated with glass powder but now kite makers coat them with metallic powder as it makes it easier to
897840 there are technical problems in enforcing rules how can one identify the person whose kite has affected transmission lines in most instances the kite which trips the line is from a broken string and there is no way to lay blame on any particular person
897841 a lot of 220 kv sub stations in east delhi get affected when kites trip power lines wherever there is some open space the problem becomes more acute
897842 they were repeatedly asked not to telecast provocative and inflammatory content
897843 the administration had earlier issued notices to the channels but they kept on transmitting highly objectionable and provocative material
897844 but since the two channels are also cable service providers without signal separators the transmission of other channels was disrupted
897845 where is the popup notification that says hey man im going to expire in 30 days you best buy a license
897846 it has more out of the box than anything else out there
897847 does a company have an ethical obligation to hire poor talent based on nationality rather than top tier talent of a foreign nationality
897848 whats the value to me will this add value faster than cost
897849 oh just find a couple of programmers and chuck them on the project
897850 im an architect now so i dont need to write code
897851 why it that senior non technical people at my company can say things like
897852 why is it that seemingly a good chunk of the community doesnt want to be called an engineer what connotation does the title engineer convey that makes people like me and others reject the title
897853 once i had to maintain a system that was garbage it didnt use
897854 one i had to maintain a system that was garbage
897855 i cant figure out whats going on in this system and the developer is long gone and im terrified that if i make one change here that the entire system will collapse
897856 poet who works only slightly removed from pure thought stuff
897857 very good professional programmers are 10 times as productive as poor ones
897858 oh you want an invoice billing system thatll take 500 hours
897859 some software development may not be done by some people based on
897860 part of the issue is that programming systems are defined by the users needs which are infinitely varied across companies
897861 i dont think software development will ever be able to be defined as engineering in the traditional sense
897862 in the other disciplins you simply cant ship a product that isnt finished but we do it all the time
897863 why is it that the community cant agree on a few ways of going about software design that are best
897864 engineers whether software or otherwise can be expected to make extensive use of mathematics in the analysis of their products including programs those who refuse to do so are technicians not engineers
897865 i am going to build a homepage in html today
897866 by the end of this week i will finish a project that interfaces with the database
897867 i know a detective who works cold cases in los angeles he works in a windowless office with his desk pushed up against his partners he has a glass top on his desk with such a basic setup in almost any other office in the world one would almost invariably find photos of loved ones children wives families under the glass top smiling faces reminders of what is good in life inspirations to do the job well but not this detective he slips the photos of dead people under his glass photos of murder victims whose killers he still hunts they are reminders of what is bad in life reminders of the job unfinished and inspiration to keep going and to do the job well

897872 trying to make a patchwork quilt look seamless a novel is made up of scraps of our own lives and bits of other peoples and things we think of in the middle of the night and whole notebooks full of randomly collected details
897873 isnt it odd how the memory has a method for dealing with lifes terrible and traumatic experiences stewart
897874 who is tentative it should be a lot of fun
897875 the cia intercepted a telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
897876 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who should be replaced and who should be appointed to which position
897877 karadzic was personally engaged in all activities of the sds in america they went crazy realising karadzic was making a fool of them the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic
897878 hes been spreading it for 12 years through his friends now hes making it personally it would have been morally reprehensible and illegal to do such a thing we made no such deal
897879 some insurers can make a decision in the same day or right on the spot
897880 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
897881 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
897882 would be able to know that you have a very high near intractable cholesterol problem
897883 though most people tell the truth most of the time there are people out there who dont who leave out something thats incredibly relevant who may even be able to defraud a company
897884 thats important because ultimately the people who tell the truth have to pay for those who dont
897885 that device had a real potential to put that family in jeopardy
897886 its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments
897887 these are odious assaults on individuals and on the principles of free inquiry by which we live
897888 today mr saeed jalili will talk over the phone with mr solana
897889 when it comes to our inalienable rights we will press ahead
897890 how about something regarding food or perhaps something phonetically similar but not the exact spelling
897891 ah its an antiquated expression for a thick stew which in modern german is eintopf
897892 jag har spelat desperat ett tag nu r jag uppgiven singel
897893 i just wanted to let everyone know that i am now back in the united states and arrived home safely
897894 overall my mother and i had a fantastic experience on this trip and we are looking forward to sharing those memories with everyone soon
897895 also it appears that jetstar has located our luggage and will be sending it back to our home when the luggage will actually appear no one knows
897896 i just wanted to let you know that my mother and i have just finished seeing the great wall it was a terrific experience and i cannot believe how steep the wall is to walk up unfortunately it was raining while seeing the wall so it hurt our experience a little bit
897897 we also just ate at a very nice restaurant called the peking duck i would have to say it was our best meal on the trip a chef comes out in front of your table and cuts up an already cooked duck and serves it to you
897898 france was visited by 92 5 per cent of the students germany and austria by 80 per cent great britain by 65 5 per cent sixty per cent went to italy 22 per cent to scandinavia 27 per cent to spain about 14 5 per cent went to one or more of these countries egypt greece israel portugal turkey yugoslavia
897899 but it was also a challenge because we had 12 different flights to meet
897900 we didnt tour much of the city but we were impressed
897901 they are one of the seven wonders of the world and lived up to their reputation
897902 they imported workers from iran to inlay the precious stones into the marble it was a beautiful structure
897903 we mostly traveled to agra and jaipur we saw how they made rugs and jewelry there in agra we saw the red sandstone fort they stayed in when being invaded by the moguls
897904 it is one of the natural wonders of the world and to see all that plant life and underwater fish and sea turtles was amazing
897905 it was one of the most unique cities we visited it was modern and the sites at tiananmen square and the forbidden city were memorable
897906 it was massive and it takes you over an hour of driving to reach it it is an engineering marvel it was built on a mountain
897907 the u s state department expects the number of applicants to swell to 4 million by june 1 2009 thats when u s travelers cannot re enter the country from mexico canada or the caribbean without a passport a new passport card or an equivalent document
897908 according to official statistics 760 000 persons flew between europe and the united states and canada in the first six months of 1960 in the same period 390 000 passengers went by ship
897909 compared with the performance in the first half of 1959 air travel increased by 100 000 passengers or 15 per cent while ship travel rose by 14 000 or 3 7 per cent
897910 shipping sources noted that a reduced flow of immigrants from europe and a curtailment of travel by united states military personnel on united states flag liners held down gains in ship travel from europe
897911 aviation sources attributed the rise in air travel volume to the greater employment of large capacity jet aircraft and to an increased demand for travel caused by greater economic prosperity
897912 the average capacity of a trans atlantic airliner rose from forty four to fifty six persons this year aboard a passenger ship it increased from 496 travelers to 563 travelers this year
897913 to engage in a constructive dialogue with the authorities to improve the human rights situation of people of myanmar burma
897914 third class railroad passage together with whatever nostalgic stigma still clings to it will be abolished tomorrow in britain and the rest of europe after 112 years of existence
897915 before the gladstone act full fare passengers traveled in comfort while the rest rode in open fence flatcars this situation arose because
897916 third class fare in those days was a penny a mile it is 1 88 pennies a mile now equivalent to about two u s cents
897917 s econd class has been virtually vacant for some years
897918 this territorially vast social promotion of a major segment of the traveling public will be virtually unnoticeable the accommodation passengers and fares will remain the same except in class designation
897919 railway officials have been at a loss to explain why the change is being made since it will result in no visible or practical difference
897920 some said it was in keeping with modern egalitarian trends but others suggested that since there are in practical terms only two classes it was more logical to call them first and second instead of first and third
897921 the jolie pitt family and getty images have agreed that all proceeds will be used for charitable purposes
897922 someone who lives 10 minutes away can have more channels than me and we still pay the same amount
897923 we want to make sure its the best customer experience possible from area to area
897924 the average increase by pln 150 is not enough because gas energy and food prices are growing much faster thats why we want additional pln 200
897925 last year each of our employees got three bonuses amounting to a monthly wage in fact the monthly increase amounts to pln 460 and not pln 150
897926 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
897927 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
897928 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
897929 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
897930 we warned folk to only deal with authorized ticket suppliers
897931 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
897932 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
897933 we have project teams working on a global basis and to help them collaborate effectively we use google apps
897934 green homes are shining through as the bright spot in an otherwise gloomy housing market
897935 this twin crisis of peak oil and climate change is spurring innovation experimentation and excitement
897936 these big challenges are what the u s is best at frankly
897937 by providing guidelines and strategies in essence our job is to keep saying yes its possible heres how
897938 there are a zillion different codes and standards out there
897939 we want to make it much easier for people to adopt our goals
897940 if the fcc were found to have erred in not establishing clear rules it could spur a future fcc to adopt rules that cable and the telcos would find far more troubling than todays order
897941 discriminatory based on race sex religion nationality disability sexual orientation or age
897942 there are too many people who have been there too long and we need new management from outside
897943 more than 50 of our processes are now in some type of software as a service or cloud environment
897944 the trade off is that the platform service is much more built out so you lose some flexibility
897945 it went from 5 or 6 per gigabyte to about 2 or 3
897946 our differentiator is software development its not storing data on generic disks
897947 if wed been down that afternoon it would have been horrible but not catastrophic
897948 as a midsize business i cant afford that kind of infrastructure support myself while driving innovation
897949 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
897950 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history i pay homage to his memory
897951 stefano gab es bez glich der probleme von felipe eine vorwarnung
897952 null leider gab es keinerlei vorwarnungen wir sahen nur pl tzlich den rauch vor uns was ziemlich schlecht f r uns war es gab kein signal keine information und keine warnung durch die telemetrie
897953 wisst ihr denn welche art von problem das war hatte kimi hnliche sorgen
897954 wir haben ihm am ende gesagt er soll es ruhig angehen lassen wir hatten das gef hl dass sich am heck ein mechanisches problem entwickelt daher wollten wir kein risiko eingehen und nur noch das auto nach hause bringen nachdem wir in der gleichen runde gesehen hatten was felipe passierte
897955 wir m ssen uns sicherlich vor den n chsten grands prix weiter verbessern
897956 was passierte dort am heck von kimi und wann habt ihr ihm gesagt er soll etwas langsamer machen
897957 wir haben ihn darauf hingewiesen genau in der runde in welcher felipe ausfiel wir bemerkten dass im mechanischen bereich an seinem heck etwas nicht richtig funktionierte also sagten wir ihm er solle das auto einfach nur nach hause bringen
897958 wie viel einfluss hat die jeweilige streckentemperatur wenn es um das kr fteverh ltnis zwischen ferrari und mclaren mercedes geht
897959 ich wei es nicht genau es ist leicht den schluss zu ziehen dass wir unter diesen bedingungen gut sind und die anderen immer und berall gut sind wir m ssen uns sicherlich vor den n chsten grands prix weiter verbessern die kommenden rennen k nnen auch in bezug auf temperaturen situationen und wetter knifflig werden wir m ssen unsere autos vielleicht wegen der reifen etwas anders abstimmen vor allem nachdem wir gesehen haben welche probleme wir in hockenheim hatten
897960 warst du berrascht als massa zu beginn des rennens ganz nach vorn kam und sogar eine l cke auf die mclaren mercedes herausfahren konnte dachtet ihr hamilton w rde sp ter stoppen als massa
897961 man wei das wirklich nie genau bevor die stopps kommen
897962 wir haben felipe st ndig ber den abstand zu hamilton informiert wir hatten erwartet dass er ungef hr zur gleichen zeit wie wir hereinkommen muss vielleicht eine oder zwei runden fr her oder sp ter wir haben genau das als grundlage f r unsere strategieplanung genommen ich muss sagen dass ich f r felipe tief traurig bin weil er wohl das beste rennen seiner karriere gefahren ist es war fantastisch weil er angegriffen hat als er angreifen musste er hat das rennen absolut kontrolliert also tut es uns f r ihn sehr leid
897963 er hat das rennen absolut kontrolliert also tut es uns f r ihn sehr leid
897964 worauf konzentriert ihr euch bis valencia auf die probleme mit der zuverl ssigkeit oder die von kimi angesprochenen sorgen im qualifying
897965 ich denke auf beides und nicht nur auf diese zwei felder werden wir uns konzentrieren nat rlich k mmern wir uns um die zuverl ssigkeit denn solche dinge d rfen nicht vorkommen vor allem nicht zehn kilometer vor dem ziel solch ein problem d rfen wir einfach nicht haben weil wir f r so etwas einen zu hohen preis zahlen zum zweiten ist die qualifikation extrem wichtig der gro e unterschied war einfach dass es uns einerseits gelungen ist dass wir nach vorne kamen und so unseren speed fahren konnten aber der andere war im vorderen mittelfeld hing dort fest und konnte nichts machen obwohl er sicherlich auch den richtigen speed gehabt h tte
897966 hat sich der status von felipe durch seinen erfolg in frankreich und dadurch dass er danach die wm angef hrt hat ver ndert ist er st rker geworden
897967 to engage in a constructive dialogue with the authorities to improve the human rights situation of people of myanmar burma
897968 if this happens i will be disappointed but a stake in the company of 30 per cent or so still is very useful for us

898009 theres only five countries that release more carbon annually than the global shipping fleet
898010 the idea of not regulating the shipping fleet is like not regulating japan
898011 the first step in any regulation is an open comment period
898012 while it does indicate many important facts it in no way comes to a conclusion that significant action needs to be taken now

898100 as a result of the war corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed i feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before even in the midst of war god grant that my suspicions may prove groundless
898101 you will yet find there is a constant effort to induce the general government to go beyond the limits of its taxing power and to impose unnecessary burdens upon the people many powerful interests are continually at work to procure heavy duties on commerce and to swell the revenue beyond the real necessities of the public service and the country has already felt the injurious effects of their combined influence
898102 there are no necessary evils in government its evils exist only in its abuses
898103 it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes

898118 some will have you believe that the wage gap for women is a myth that we already have laws in place to make pay discrimination on the basis of gender illegal
898119 but just because something is illegal does not mean that it does not continue to happen
898120 isnt needed to protect women from wage discrimination such protection is already found in the law
898121 at the end of the day this bill will invite more lawyers to file more lawsuits because it offers them a bigger payday
898122 the bill before the house treats pay discrimination as systemic
898123 this bill does little more than dole out favors to the democrats trial lawyer allies with no new benefit to protect workers

898125 dua minggu lalu saya berjumpa rakan yang menyatakan terdapat klip video aksi pasangan kanak kanak lelaki dan perempuan cuba melakukan seks
898126 saya yang tidak mempercayai kata katanya kerana menyangka ia hanya gurauan kemudian terperanjat apabila menyaksikan klip video itu
898127 setahu kita kebanyakan klip video membabitkan remaja tetapi kini kanak kanak yang langsung belum mencapai tahap baligh
898128 pendedahan kanak kanak terhadap bahan seperti itu akan menyebabkan mereka tertarik untuk mencubanya kerana mungkin ia sesuatu menyeronokkan
898129 yang menjadi kerisauan saya juga ialah kanak kanak dipergunakan pihak tertentu untuk mencari keuntungan
898130 tengok kebanyakan remaja kini yang berpakaian menjolok mata ibarat tak cukup kain nak pakai itu sudah cukup membuktikan bahawa ibu bapa sendiri tidak kisah mengenai anak mereka dan apa yang dilakukan
898131 apa perlu yang dihairankan jika kini kanak kanak seawal usia lima tahun pun sudah mula menonton dan menggayakan aksi terlampau terbabit

898170 martys creative front page layouts and the way he used photographs were a gift to successive weekend editors and millions of sunday readers
898171 his wry humor every day he was here was a gift to everyone who worked with him
898172 marty was a calm quiet presence one of the most modest and nicest people in the newsroom and one of its most talented
898173 anyone who ever did a stint as weekend editor always knew that with martys reassuring presence nothing could go too badly wrong even as the bulldog deadline approached no one in this newsroom ever saw marty lose his cool
898174 he had that signature blend of high standards and collegiality that defines the editing craft
898175 then and since his news judgments have been solid as a rock
898176 if hes got a manual rather than an auto you have to teach him how to drive it and look after it then fucked if i know how theyre supposed to work

898189 it was a performance where we had a lot of good things and a lot of things to be pleased about
898190 we had some mistakes and as i told the team football is still that way the team that doesnt beat themselves has the best chance to win
898191 all in all we had some things to be encouraged about we had some penalties we have to get straightened around and we had some errors but we had a lot of good individual performances
898192 we could have done some things better but we were in the game and they made more plays at the end
898193 a lot of young players stepped up and played well i thought our offense moved the ball and our defense gave us a chance at the end all of those things are really good qualities that you look for in the first game
898194 you want to see how guys are going to react to being in their first game in the nfl i thought overall we showed well the first offense moved the ball well we moved the ball well sorg played well think there are a number of things to build on
898195 aside from the final score i think we had some things to be pleased about
898196 except for a couple of bad plays which you cant have in this game we had a lot of good individual performances
898197 its a learning experience mainly for the young guys to see how they adapt and how they play under pressure the young guys did a great job especially on the defensive front getting to the quarterback
898198 thats our focus we have to get to the quarterback and we did a great job of that
898199 this is a very important step in the evolution of chinas relationship with the world
898200 we were looking for 12 to 15 plays the only thing we didnt do was finish it in the red zone but we made some third downs we protected well jim got rid of the ball and was accurate it was good to see
898201 things were a lot smoother out there than i thought they were going to be
898202 going no huddle gives you a lot of time to see what the defense is going to do and make some adjustments i thought the first drive was a good drive i would have liked to have put it in the end zone for seven and i think that the red zone is where two of my incompletions were so thats obviously something ive got to work on but for the first time stepping in and going out there it felt pretty good
898203 i think he did great i think he managed the offense very well he played to what they gave us we ran the ball we threw the ball i thought he did a great job
898204 it gives him an opportunity to play with some fellows that hes had limited opportunity to play with in the past
898205 when hes had a chance to play he has played pretty well up in seattle he did a great job we just didnt stop the seahawks he did more than his share that day and other times when he has had a chance to play with the first group hes played well
898206 hes going to have an extended opportunity to play with them and im sure hell do fine
898207 i thought i was going to play a little more than that tonight but im sure they had a plan
898208 ill follow what they say but when i got on the phone with associate head coach jim caldwell i didnt expect him to say i was out i was kind of hoping to get another series maybe two
898209 i was thinking to myself what does peyton normally do when he comes out of the game i got the hat and i got the sunflowers seeds and i got the little thing so i could hear the plays
898210 it felt kind of awkward at first but i got used to it
898211 every dollar residents pay for trash pickup will be used to put more officers on the streets
898212 if you notice every run i had the line did a great job there was always a hole for me to get through im not going to be able to get any yards if the lines not blocking they did a great job so they get the credit definitely
898213 weve seen that from mike for four years of college and weve seen it every day in practice
898214 he just continues to run hard and block well and catch the ball do the things you need to get done
898215 thats the only thing i can handle is how i play on the field i have to go out there and try not to make mistakes and do the best i can its up to the coaches and mr colts president bill polian after that
898216 i think the more you play the more confidence you get you see five six year vets in the league they have confidence as a rookie the more experience i get the more its going to help me out as a player
898217 you have to do it every game it doesnt matter if i play great this game and the next four games i go out there and dont do anything i just have to come out here and be consistent and do the best i can
898218 the infectious disease doctor has signed off on that theres no structural damage to the knee so thats the only serious problem that has been eliminated so now youre on to the rehab process
898219 hes working on range of motion its just a process
898220 came through the first week of practice in really good shape and good spirits
898221 we just need to work through it every general manger in the league sings the same song at this time of year were all worried to death about injuries
898222 this last week hasnt been good for us but you have to fight your way through it and hope that the guys who are out are out for a short period of time and not a long period of time
898223 i dont even know what his physical status is right now i dont believe hes ready to play football at this point youd have to determine where he is football wise first
898224 he was ready to go back in the game the first group was out at that point but hes fine
898225 we want to see who jumps out and makes plays in the ballgame we want to see how all the new players perform under pressure and particularly who distinguish themselves and who jumps out from the vast majority you might say its the same every year there are always surprises a player who you didnt think was doing so well in camp the lights go on and he does particularly well its always a very interesting process and i look forward to it
898226 the k plussa reform started in spring 2007 has proceeded even better than expected there are now over half a million cooperation cards and the plussa special offer benefits granted in addition to the points will total over 200 million ahead of time during this year
898227 the plussa special offer benefits always amount to at least 10 we want to provide plussa customers with more and better benefits at checkouts as over 60 percent of cardholders prefer discounts granted at the checkout this came out in a survey conducted by tns gallup for the op pohjola group and the k group
898228 new cards have been issued at a steady rate more than 5 000 cards per week even during the summer there is an obvious demand for this kind of a card
898229 we believe that the growth rate will remain the same in the future
898230 it seems that the combination card increases the number of card payments at store checkouts and accordingly decreases the use of cash
898231 using the card gives customers two kinds of benefits plussa points and special offers at the own and plussa network stores and op bonuses for purchases paid with the visa card

898290 college may actually encourage rather than deter social deviance and risk taking
898291 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
898292 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
898293 having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire
898294 its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
898295 for the first game i dont have anything to be disappointed about
898296 i was excited to have a big turnover for a touchdown at the end that shows the guys playing it all the way through
898297 its kind of that time of camp where you have the nicks and bumps and bruises and were going to take good care of our guys so were pretty conservative with this stuff
898298 man im back im back feeling good getting back out there running around its awesome its awesome just to be back that training room is no place you want to be
898299 but at the same time i have to be healthy to be able to compete and that was my main concern
898300 im going to go up in there and say let me go let me go because i feel good i didnt feel no biting or anything
898301 im happy for those guys because i was in that same boat last year
898302 out there making plays it gets me fired up a little bit inside like hey i can make plays like that thats just my competitive streak
898303 i was concerned at the three eighths pole and it looked like we were beat turning for home
898304 but he got down on his belly and he won though
898305 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out today he showed hes a warrior
898306 i think right now rick will evaluate him and well plan a sensible campaign
898307 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
898308 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
898309 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship
898310 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
898311 ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us
898312 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
898313 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
898314 it wasnt that hard of a hit we almost did a 360 and landed right side up as it went up i thought holy crap because it was totally unexpected usually thats the safest place on the race course you hit hard but usually you dont go over
898315 you push these boats hard enough and its going to happen
898316 i was trying to keep it safe down the straightaways and not do anything stupid
898317 i got a good start i got out in front but with those two boats it would be pretty tough to beat them from the outside i hit a roller it got unhooked air got under the sponsor and off we went
898318 were not supposed to go under 70 mph before the start and bernard and david werent going that fast this boat is fast enough to win thats why i feel bad for the guys on the crew who gave me a great boat
898319 it stinks because we were probably going to win that heat and pick up points on david
898320 we lost the points but were just glad that bryant is ok
898321 i wanted to go out and have some fun but were glad to get in who knows what could happen in the final i just want to keep clean and let the other guys take themselves out
898322 you just keep working you come back and relax and drive we had a plan and we executed it
898323 it would not make sense to run in the derby if he didnt run well today
898324 the coaches tell us be the class that turns this around within ourselves the guys we talk about how we can make an impact or try to make an impact anyway possible so its among us
898325 if we can bridge that experience gap at receiver and running back then both of those positions can be strengths for us
898326 as good a group of receivers as ive been around in my 20 plus years of coaching college football
898327 its going to be a huge learning curve for all these receivers kavario and the running backs
898328 ive got to be smart enough to figure out whats enough and whats too much playing with this many young kids its going to be critical for our coaching staff to find the line where we are doing enough but not doing too much
898329 they got a chance to see the speed of the game at this level before they come out here this week and its all fast and furious and they are going wow
898330 they have seen it already so that was critical that they were able to do a little bit of that
898331 getting the lingo down the plays retraining your mind its difficult and time consuming
898332 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
898333 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
898334 it was a bad call by the referee there were three of us theoret villwock and steve david all going the same speed so why just call me if you penalize one of us you have to penalize all of us
898335 whether it worked or not was dependent on whether the referees actually adhered to the rules
898336 im happy to say they did its a judgment call and when were this close those calls have to be made
898337 in a perfect world if i got my wish i could get 61 wins and be even with chip and let bill be bill
898338 whether i ever get that close who knows bill was one of the most exemplary people in this sport if i won more than him i dont think it would have any meaning to me
898339 weve really struggled we got a gift with the wind so we hone our combinations in the rough water when there are seven boats on the water its a lot like those rough windy conditions
898340 i was pulling up to him when i heard there he had a one minute penalty
898341 its not a good idea to drive the boat hard when the owner is screaming one minute penalty one minute penalty in your ear i could have won
898342 we had an awesome boat we had a great start and the race was done right there
898343 to get the victory and have it taken away from you is a shame
898344 the fans need to know that the guy out front is the one who wins
898345 theyre great shoppers definitely easier than women they buy jewelry in sets and take one minute max to shop
898346 the one who was supposed to be the last one we called red after a stoplight
898347 i dont particularly like the fact that scout com have people getting rich off kids selling information
898348 i have a question is saying secluded and muskoka redundant
898349 america wont see another transfer of power that big until nov 4
898350 the only over under left for him is the choice of bunk beds
898351 if you see a bunch of people under 5 foot 9 thats us
898352 any offensive lineman likes to be aggressive in their play and their attitude and everything else thats the way coach solari coaches thats the way that i coach
898353 linemen respond to that its the way the games played up front and i feel like you have to coach that way
898354 you know what i like there you took the inside
898355 i didnt know coach solari before i came here and weve really gotten along great and are working well together
898356 i think were very similar in the way we do coach and i think the players probably appreciate that because youre not getting one guy thats completely different than the other
898357 its just natural its kind of a person coach that coach holmgren looks for its a good teacher
898358 with the new guys im not as hard on them as i am on my old coaches im trying to get off on the right foot
898359 what i told solari is youre going to have to learn all our stuff and were going to run our stuff but then if you see something or absolutely think something is better then were going to do that too
898360 he said hey you just run all your routes at the same speed
898361 the point being that he sent me a letter back and responded right away and when i was playing in college i thought that was the best i got it back within a week and a half i was impressed by that
898362 the quarterback coach for me you have to have an iron jock you know what i mean
898363 you have to spend a lot of time because theres so many details that go into getting it right for an nfl offense
898364 and you have to make sure before youre with the players and before you present anything to them youre all together you have all the details and youre ready to go
898365 the new fellows we have as coaches on the staff i couldnt be happier
898366 they are really good guys quality people and excellent football coaches i mean excellent football coaches
898367 a whole lot of groups out there that nobody has ever heard of
898368 we should remember that without the gujarat muslims there would have been no gandhi and maybe even no india his first funders his first promoters the office bearers the activists of the natal indian congress the leaders of the satyagraha movement were all muslims and parsis and later on south indians so i think gandhi would have reminded us that we are country that is a wonderfully diverse and rich mosaic we dont know who is behind the terror attacks they could be indians or foreigners whichever be the case gandhi would have counseled restraint and would have reminded us of this unique diverse fabric
898369 gandhi would have told us to understand pain and to be empathise with those in pain that understanding of pain is missing in our present day political and social leadership unless you have a theory of pain you cannot have a theory of healing and thats where i think bapu was so good
898370 if he were in ahmedabad now a hindu ahmedabad and a muslim ahmedabad could not have been created on such impermeable terms in the first place if gandhi had been a living presence in ahmedabad we would not have been talking of two ahmedabads in the first place
898371 the fact that we speak of two ahmedabads is also proof that gandhi is no longer available to us as a social imagination in ahmedabad
898372 foreigners must respect chinese laws while in china and must not harm chinas national security or damage social order
898373 foreign students like to stay out all night on the weekend but in more intellectual and traditional chinese households there is no way the kids would go out like that

898381 theres an obligation on the environment agency to have to review these combined sewer overflows
898382 the problem is that the sewer system was designed for a climate which is different from the one we have got now
898383 the combined sewer overflows are starting to discharge a lot more often than they should their environmental impact is greatly increasing
898384 it amounts effectively to a licence to pollute because there are no restrictions on how much and how often these pipes can discharge
898385 we have identified around 3 500 remaining temporary consents for cso discharges
898386 these are mainly for storm overflows that are operating without causing problems
898387 as youd expect our priority has always been to focus on those consents that are a problem
898388 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along

898393 the quality of the content and the information is paramount

898655 this has been a really horrible year with all of the injuries and stuff
898656 this puts it all in perspective we have lost one of the greatest figures in the city of atlantas history
898657 i thought he was doing a lot better i thought he had more energy this week and seemed more like his old self its like losing a family member
898658 tomorrow a baseball game will be played by a lot of young men with heavy hearts
898659 this has been a really horrible year with all of the injuries and stuff this puts it all in perspective we have lost one of the greatest figures in the city of atlantas history
898660 i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits
898661 weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
898662 back in our lean years when we werent very good he was able to entertain with sarcasm
898663 then when we turned things around and starting winning every year he made the transition and had the opportunity to make the greatest call in atlanta braves history
898664 it was just fitting that he got to do that because he meant so much to this organization
898665 fly ball deep center field grissoms on the run yes yes yes the atlanta braves have given you a championship listen to this crowd a mob scene is on the field wohlers gets them 1 2 3
898666 i knew he cared about what i was doing and what was going on
898667 he was always good to me its a shame we all lost a friend today
898668 he loved the braves and he loved his job he wasnt ever going to let anybody or anything tell him he couldnt do his job anymore
898669 do you have a seat do you have a seat
898670 do you want to know how i got my scar
898671 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea
898672 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
898673 i had to walk away but we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
898674 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
898675 we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail ninety nine percent of the time it works out for us
898676 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
898677 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
898678 im not going to bring a guy in that throws 85 miles an hour to hit somebody i guarantee it
898679 ill bring octavio dotel ill bring matt thornton then i will tell them to throw at them thats the way i do business
898680 is not about producing more oil its really about producing more profits for big oil
898681 i would oppose drilling off the jersey shore or anywhere else that would pose a danger to the jersey shore
898682 there are hundreds of millions of acres available for drilling on shore in the united states and lots of acreage offshore in the western gulf
898683 we should be drilling there now to help relieve the pain for people driving their cars and paying so much at the pump
898684 i havent seen any information to date to lead me to conclude that the overwhelming cause of the high gas prices is anything other than high demand and flat supply
898685 i will have an open mind on the issue of adjusting the tax treatment for oil companies
898686 this movement is the most important movement in britain today
898687 we are here to give a message to the government and our message is very clear we have just 100 months in which to effect a massive transition away from a fossil fuel economy
898688 the governments addiction to fossil fuels is not only destroying the environment but also peoples lives now
898689 the police seem to be trying to stop kingsnorth climate camp going ahead and if this is the intention it is illegal and i will be drawing it to the attention of the european commission as well as the uk authorities
898690 we wanted to police lawful protest recognising that this is the right of people in a free country
898691 however equipment we seized from the site suggests that some protesters were clearly intent on unlawful action
898692 a new coal fired power station at kingsnorth will most likely prevent the uk from meeting its own c02 targets perhaps the police ought to be more worried about this corporate environmental destruction instead of people in a field
898693 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
898694 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
898695 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
898696 i believe party unity calls for the delegates to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
898697 you cant expect to build a pyramid and see everything change overnight it happens gradually
898698 the possibility of any emergency decreases including hurricanes and typhoons it seriously changes physical and psychological conditions
898699 they say no pills can help you like the pyramid
898700 bad things used to happen my husband drank a lot and we had no money
898701 now i live alone and life is better i feel healthier
898702 a brief description of the effect of the pyramid shape on things
898703 a brief description of the effect of the pyramid shape on the organism
898704 on the whole everything is pretty harmonious with the backdrop of some fatigue
898705 you are aimed toward material values you may make a good businessman
898706 most people want to resolve personal problems with their characters or see how their spiritual development is proceeding
898707 its difficult for me to really seriously judge but i do believe it has some cosmic force
898708 they say the pyramid charges everything here with special energy i was always curious about it
898709 the congress shall have power to coin money regulate the value thereof
898710 the thing we need is an architecture that combines the full programmability of the cpu with the kinds of parallelism and other special capabilities of graphics processors and that architecture is larrabee
898711 it is not a gpu as many have mistakenly described it but it can do most graphics functions
898712 it looks like a gpu and acts like a gpu but actually what its doing is introducing a large number of x86 cores into your pc
898713 larrabee does not require a special api larrabee will excel on standard graphics apis
898714 so existing games will be able to run on larrabee products
898715 and of that population two suppliers ati and nvidia own 98 percent of the discrete gpu business
898716 and the trend line indicates a flattening to decline in the business however intel is no light weight start up and to enter the market today a company has to have a major infrastructure deep ip intellectual property and marketing prowess intel has all that and more
898717 the kids are taking it pretty well my wife and i are very shaken up i also injured both feet in the escape
898718 there are instructions on how to make it on their web sites
898719 its one thing to be an activist its another to be an extremist
898720 its absolutely outrageous that you would bring this kind of an attack to a family all because of your passion over this cause to me its indicative of people who have a complete inability to articulate their point in a constructive manner
898721 trying to send a message to this guy who wont listen to reason that if he doesnt stop hurting animals more drastic measures will be taken its certainly not an initial tactic but a tactic of last resort
898722 is aimed at understanding how brain connections form during development with special focus on the visual system
898723 so we can learn how to fix these connections after damage due to injury or disease
898724 i feel bad that anyone would take that drastic a step to harm people
898725 the downstairs was so smoky that we could not see
898726 my wife and children all escaped out of the bedroom window using a fire escape ladder a neighbor and then the fire department came and put out the fire

898729 youre absolutely right that its harder now for people to stay happy
898730 im hearing about more and more people being depressed and adult suicide is slightly up across the state but i cant say for sure that its connected to the economy
898731 in times like this we need to focus on whats really essential and makes us happy in our lives like family and ethical and spiritual values
898732 conceivably we could become better people and better neighbors because we have to become more self sufficient

898747 you have had minimum wage go up again commodity prices continue to go up were in a softening consumer market where the consumer is less willing to accept the price increases than they might have been in the past the companies are having to eat the cost difference

898760 we are the plasma tv generation who are more celebrity health and looks conscious as well as more self empowered than a generation ago
898761 it had been a tough couple of years and i hadnt spent any money on myself even for haircuts
898762 i had changed as a person and the outside of me did not reflect the inside any more i had neglected myself
898763 having this transformation gave me back some of the self confidence i had lost
898764 made it the makeover happen as opposed to me making a list and putting myself at the bottom of it
898765 we see people on the television who have had their eyes done or their teeth capped or had a wardrobe makeover and we think why not
898766 shows like trinny and susannah have increased the awareness of image services and consequently they are being used by everyone from senior executives and grandmothers to brides to be even men and women going through separation it gives them reassurance and get up and go again
898767 i had lost 14 kilograms and none of my clothes fitted
898768 but i also felt it was time for something different everywhere i went i dressed in asexual dark clothing which was what they taught us in business school
898769 i looked at women like goldie hawn and thought grandmothers dont look granny any more
898770 i felt better about myself i looked better and i was dated off my feet sometimes it was two dates a day
898771 oh my god the difference between the preparations for this wedding and my first
898772 how you dress groom yourself and communicate ultimately determines your success in todays business or personal environment
898773 our research shows the respondents on average spend between 5000 and 10 000 and up to 200 hours a year on image enhancing services
898774 we have an increased awareness of areas of our lives that arent perfect so more people are willing to pay for this kind of help
898775 our parents tended to run up the white flag about 40
898776 a biokineticist will be helping him with an exercise routine and a psychologist will deal with his emotional side as often after surgery some patients experience depression
898777 it will start fairly soon as long as no pressure is placed on his chest for the moment he will be able to walk or use an exercise bike
898778 many patients feel a major improvement after surgery because their deterioration had been quite slow they need to be careful that they dont rush it
898779 we have had people who have had bypass operations who have run marathons and done the argus cycle tour
898780 asi es la vida en l liceo ahora en vacaciones
898781 a tropical cyclone now centred within about 800 kilometres of hong kong may affect the city
898782 a tropical cyclone now centred within about 800 kilometres of hong kong may affect the
898783 i used to never fill out a time card now i fill out three of them
898784 i was in a state of depression for i dont know how many years
898785 it just destroyed me it was unbelievable i was in a very dark state
898786 one violation was we signed deandre hackett and he was playing in a basketball game and it was a violation to go and watch him play
898787 an assistant keith borges said it was a violation to go and watch him play and then rob phenicie said ron whos going to know were northridge i said youre right lets go and watch it now its just a letter of reprimand we didnt even talk to them
898788 ron got himself into trouble but i think the chancellor was looking for a way to drop the program and the administration was looking for it
898789 they brought a financial guy in who was doing the investigation and he didnt know whether the ball was pumped or stuffed they had a lot of the wrong people making the decisions
898790 ego i dont know if i have an ego anymore our rules of thumb here and theyve worked are stay humble stay hungry
898791 i went two years through personal counseling with anger management depression it was tough i never thought it was real i wouldnt go fishing i wouldnt do anything nothing
898792 thats why you finish strong get beat like a drum but finish strong
898793 theres too many good receivers out there right now thats unethical
898794 the one saving grace through this whole thing is ive been able to spend more time with my son
898795 i am the field trip dad no doubt about it all the kids know me
898796 i thought id be back at northridge putting together a i aa power or a division i coordinator
898797 i knew i would be in one of those two places
898798 when youre intentionally stating oh thats just a stupid rule im going to go forward then it becomes more serious
898799 i think that became part of this this was a coach that knew the rule but said it was a stupid rule and was moving ahead and violated it
898800 the stuff he did on the scale of national attention doesnt even make a blip on the radar
898801 if you go to indiana nobody even remembers that cal state northridge had a football team and ron ponciano was the coach
898802 but any administrator is going to look at a coach that had a violation more than a coach that did not so hes in that group but hes not above everyone else hes just part of that group
898803 i heard nothing but good things about him as a football coach
898804 i think he would be a real good choice particularly for a program in the west because he has so many connections
898805 hes a tireless worker a good coach he certainly should be at a division i school if that is what he desires ive called him a number of times to speak with him about players especially at the junior college level
898806 i dont know how many people ron knows out there
898807 i think its really important that you know people and you network properly
898808 look at neuheisel at ucla and other people around the country that get jobs i think ron knows the ground rules and if he was hired by somebody and they said look these are the ground rules and if you violate any one of them youre out of there hed be a good soldier
898809 even though its still tough and i think about it daily i think i still did the right thing and have nothing to be ashamed of in my opinion
898810 we believe that the impact on japanese banks of their exposure to the government sponsored enterprises is minimal since they do not own equity
898811 this matter is not simply about jacob zuma it is about the principles and practices upon which we intend to build a new society one that is democratic just and equitable
898812 their hours and years of steady and often times of solitary practice when no one was watching and no one was cheering has paid off
898813 representing your country at the olympic games is one of the highest honours that can be bestowed upon a sportsperson
898814 winning an olympic medal is incredibly difficult and requires a combination of factors including aptitude dedication support and good fortune
898815 some of the fans will love you and some will hate you but im in a good position and most fans love me for me what happened this summer is over
898816 you have to come on the pitch enjoy your football and show them you have desire to play for their team
898817 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
898818 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
898819 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
898820 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
898821 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
898822 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
898823 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
898824 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
898825 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
898826 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
898827 if modernity is the problem whats the three step solution
898828 a service for friends family and co workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick frequent answers to one simple question what are you doing
898829 when the individual is our starting point we can find no way to satisfy the basic yearning of the human heart which has been created for communion
898830 after we have done our best to communicate to a lost world still we must never forget that the final apologetic which jesus gives is the observable love of true christians for true christians
898831 how can we possibly live faithfully in such a context
898832 always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have
898833 oh bastion of christendom how your days are past here you stand testament to all that is wrong with religion your dominant silhouette appearing to rise indomitably into the sky reminding us of all the ill you have wrought on our culture and nation
898834 that is a nice building i wonder how much it costs to tour the museum
898835 once the money hits your account a charge back will be impossible since the money is no longer in your pay pal account

898840 die damit bewirkte neuerliche erh hung der milchmenge ist angesichts der gegenw rtigen marktsituation mit niedrigpreisen nicht akzeptabel
898841 ich sehe auch die gefahr dass durch eine verknappung der deutschen produktion ausgel ste preiserh hungen zu mehr milchimporten aus anderen eu l ndern f hren k nnten mit der folge erneuter preissenkungen und sinkender erl se der deutschen bauern

898854 im afraid that further consumer electronics producers and their partners will disappear from poland why produce panels here if you can import them from asia and pay no duty the government is responsible for the economic policy and has means to encourage for investments with grants duties or subsidies for training of employees
898855 the plant will limit production through 2008 and adjust to new aims in 2009 there will be no layoffs at the plant the workers will be employed in other plants and take part in schooling to be able to start new duties

898864 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now
898865 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
898866 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight

898916 tony romo told me to continue to be patient and work on things
898917 they both were very inspiring and gave some helpful tips i think i can take away while not being on the field right away they kind of shared that eagerness and the competitiveness about wanting to get in there and want to play
898918 like all flash memory devices flash drives can sustain only a limited number of write erase cycles before failure in normal use mid range flash drives currently on the market will support several million cycles although write operations will gradually slow as the device ages
898919 its slowing down im starting to grasp the whole concept of the defense things have started going a little bit better
898920 its been a big jump youre playing with all pro guys guys that have been to the pro bowl super bowls experienced guys so its definitely a learning experience
898921 you have to respect guys like that guys with that level of talent who play like that and play at that high level all the time
898922 you have to respect it and learn from it thats what im trying to do
898923 we knew he had good ability he has a lot of toughness you wouldnt think that a guy from a small school like that would have and he enjoys playing the game and hell mix it up
898924 so thats the surprising thing that you know about him and we like about him i think hes a good young prospect and hes going to do pretty good
898925 you want the truth no im not surprised because he can play

898934 what can we do to the o s to enable developers to create the apps they want for their customers
898935 how can we make the development tools easier to use to lower the cost of delivering that software in a timely fashion
898936 why cant microsoft be more like us and push native code on their developers
898937 because we cant sell you new software if you dont
898938 you need hundreds of lines in c and in net its 3 lines of code

898945 if you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people
898946 they proved it this was just a practice i cant wait until we get to the games
898947 we have the coaches calling out the plays but theyre not going to be in the games
898948 so i get into the huddle and try to listen to the quarterbacks rhythm
898949 youve got to learn guys tendencies and get used to guys
898950 but its pretty easy with this group because they all know how to play the game they all know how to move without the ball and so its pretty easy to find someone out there
898951 we have films from all over the world that our audiences will definitely enjoy theyre not just going to be popcorn entertainment we have some very thoughtful pieces that will inspire and hopefully encourage audiences to take action
898952 throughout his exceptional career mr jenkins has brought a unique and independent voice to the film industry through a vast body of work that reflects the values associated with george m cohan and celebrated with this award
898953 his focus is different and hes not going to play football anymore hes just going to stress his academics and graduate in december we respect his decision we know its been a difficult one for him and one that he has thought a great deal about were disappointed to see him leave and wish him the best
898954 we cannot wait for the study results to begin to prepare for the optimal use and delivery of prep
898955 instead we should look ahead to consider all of the possible outcomes of these trials and make real plans for making prep available to those who can benefit from it as quickly and safely as possible if it is proven effective
898956 obviously i am upset and worried for my familys safety in the future
898957 once we rebuild our house and move back in i dont know what more we can do
898958 i dont think the university can do too much to prevent these kind of attacks i would like to see the citizens of santa cruz and our elected officials including the mayor step up and condemn this kind of violence
898959 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
898960 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
898961 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
898962 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
898963 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
898964 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
898965 of course the u s government should pay compensation its the u s militarys fault
898966 we feel detailed investigation should be done by the u s government itself
898967 u s forces napalmed numerous small buildings and strafed children women and old people in the open area
898968 there were many similar incidents refugees gathered in certain places and there were airstrikes
898969 everybody came out of their houses to see these low flying planes and everyone was hit
898970 the u s air force regarded all people in white as possible enemy
898971 civilians in villages cannot normally be identified as either north koreans south koreans or guerrillas
898972 i ran forward and all i could hear were people coughing and screaming and some were probably already dead
898973 so many people think that bullying is just a rite of passage
898974 kids have feelings too and so thats what we try to do is help them channel and be able to discuss and find a solution that works for them
898975 thats the key to the whole thing that violence is never the answer
898976 ive always liked the comedy part of it and that kind of stuff
898977 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
898978 i had spent from 1968 to about 1997 never having talked to another manchu
898979 all of a sudden you had someone to talk to about the experiences
898980 one of the favorite expressions was baby killer i have consciously tried to forget most of it it wasnt my job to go over there and kill babies
898981 its been a long time but your service is no less appreciated in this nation than that of the men who stand before you
898982 the enemys the same almost its not fighting like it should be they just blow our stuff up and run off i always knew when we went over that the vietnam guys would be behind us because they know what its like to fight an enemy that doesnt fight right
898983 as soon as i heard they were coming home i told my wife i said im going
898984 said johnny guidry 60 who flew in from raceland la
898985 they needed closure just like i did they needed a response from their people they needed a response from their older brothers like we are and yes a welcome home
898986 i think the american people have realized they blamed the wrong people in vietnam
898987 theres been a realization that if you are unhappy with the war the fact is the military guys go because they were told to go
898988 why couldnt anybody from the community have shown up you dont need a son or a dad or a husband coming home to come out and welcome them home
898989 it was one of the most horrible experiences of my entire life
898990 i came home pretty much just a mental wreck i would wake up sweating and fighting in the night and my first wife didnt know how to deal with that to tell you the truth i didnt either
898991 i could see a lot of similarities between the two wars there was a country split over the rightness or wrongness of the war but i wanted to really talk about the experience of these guys individually and how most all of them found themselves there not because you know they didnt sign up to go fight the communists it was the kennedy era the whole ask what you can do for your country thing they were doing what was asked of them
898992 unfortunate sons a true story of young men and war
898993 i had spent from 1968 to about 1997 never having talked to another manchu
898994 all of a sudden you had someone to talk to about the experiences the years that had gone by someone who you knew would understand what you were talking about
898995 old man look at my life im a lot like you were
898996 it was a very very challenging fight heavily entrenched insurgents a very dangerous place theres just no other way to put it we worked very hard there for about nine months and the soldiers made a tremendous difference it became a much safer place
898997 we know a lot of vietnam vets suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and one of the reasons they suffered so much was because when they got home people didnt recognize what theyd done in a good way their buddies werent with them and most guys just buried it and thats the worst thing you can do
898998 so ive talked with some of these older guys and i think they can help i know they will try
898999 one thing has not changed and never will the bond that grew out of our shared experiences after what all of you have been through together i am sure you feel it too and i am sure that 40 years from now you will still feel it when you look back on those days
899000 did they get it do they understand what it means to be thinking about it every day after 40 long years for gods sake hold on to each other
899001 in the flurry of backyard barbecues and visits to old friends now in the years ahead when youre building your families figuring out how to send your kids to college getting laid off from your job dont forget these strong young men standing beside you you will need them
899002 i wanted them to know that im grateful for their service
899003 you know we never came to a consensus that this is how we as americans feel about the vietnam experience we just stopped talking about it
899004 but for us its still there whatever we did we didnt deserve to be ignored
899005 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
899006 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
899007 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
899008 is the living memory of a nation it sustains within itself and safeguards a nations bygone history
899009 but woe to that nation whose literature is cut short by the intrusion of force
899010 i would say its self explanatory and clear that you shouldnt extort patients
899011 i work on womens issues social affairs and workers rights
899012 he said lets make a deal you give me information and ill make it easy for you to go israel
899013 contingent on an applicants willingness to submit any information except for reliable information on his medical condition
899014 it has these tremendous snowfalls so you get these tremendous avalanches
899015 its one of those mountains where once youve climbed it you dont ever go back
899016 for every step you go up it tries to bring you down
899017 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
899018 if theres no fixed rope they could still descend they could still rappel
899019 they have to remember the summit is optional to get down is mandatory
899020 way north scientists at the national snow and ice data center say strong southerly
899021 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering
899022 if the camps had really been stupid and wasteful and tragic that meant that the soviet union was stupid and wasteful and tragic too
899023 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
899024 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
899025 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence
899026 i feel that yeltsin permitted an enormous devastation of russia
899027 millions of people associate the name and work of alexander solzhenitsyn with russias fate
899028 his academic research outstanding literary work and in fact his entire life have been dedicated to the fatherland
899029 kids grab the towels and the sun screen were gonna indulge in an all day relaxathon at the pool

899033 people feed their dogs junk food and give them no exercise
899034 obesity can result in arthritis skin problems and high cholesterol
899035 the owners are working and leave the dog alone at home due to which it suffers from separation anxiety at times if there are two dogs in the family and one gets more attention the other feels neglected
899036 a dog with no biting history starts biting or running randomly in circles the problems are generally treated psychologically as medicines arent available
899037 the salts are the same we just have to keep the dosage in mind
899038 generally we try to treat them psychologically we resort to anti anxiety drugs only sparingly
899039 determining the final two men and two women wholl be competing in the final hour
899040 the gladiators are not going to be taking any prisoners
899041 i think it turned out really well i think people will be satisfied in the end you never really know whats going to happen some competitors come in and you think theyre going to be strong and theyre not up to your expectations and luck has a little bit to do with it
899042 ive been blessed to have a really easy pregnancy but now that its getting toward the end im feeling antsy
899043 what we now think of as the television and movie industry youre not even going to recognize it in 10 years in terms of what is made how its made how people consume it thats why there is such an upheaval
899044 people are going to consume their entertainment on the internet there arent going to be network programmers nobodys going to put a schedule together and decide when youre going to watch something youre going to decide that
899045 commercials arent going to get seen either theyre going to have to find another way to get revenue and advertise its a revolution and both sides in town are a little perplexed by it and are trying to look out for whats going to happen but i dont know if anybody has the answers
899046 ive seen parts of it and its quite good they have to maintain their standard after all
899047 it was the same kind of feel as doing talladega nights once we do what is scripted then it opens up quite a bit cut is not yelled so you keep going until youre ad libbing all over yourself it can be anxiety ridden but with the right people and the right director it can enhance whatever theyve got on paper
899048 ive been offered at least three reality shows a week for the last three years
899049 but if im going to do a reality show then ive got to be able to change things have people learn from it i could have made a lot of money but its not what i wanted to stand for
899050 an essential part of growing up adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
899051 the research shows that children need to experience challenging play in order to develop important life skills and to better manage risk and challenge in their daily lives
899052 however opportunities for children to take such risks are limited this is due to our risk averse culture and an increase in health and safety constraints it is clear that we need to address the current cotton wool culture and to provide children with more opportunities for adventurous play
899053 i dont know if gareth barry will leave aston villa at the moment i am not on this case i like gareth barry and i like two or three other players but i dont speak about names
899054 xabi is a very good player and it will not be easy to sell because of the value of alonso in the market will be really high

899062 that would be a very substantial addition and would make monta a de oro one of the largest state parks
899063 altogether we should have the money we need to make the entire purchase
899064 the opportunity to make all of this work is here and now
899065 its really always been our intention and understanding that it would become part of the state park
899066 were looking make a gift to the state but wed like to recover some of the property taxes and other expenses weve incurred over the years
899067 we would have to create a staging area without opening the park to cars but those are not high cost items
899068 the absence of written policies procedures protocols and expectations was the critical deficiency

899070 i feel like i havent lost a step since last year
899071 i feel a little bit quicker a little bit more explosive maybe even a little faster
899072 i think hes a little more powerful than people give him credit for because he looks kind of slight
899073 but he weighs 193 pounds so he can run with power thats something hes going to acquire more and more of as he plays like marshawn did marshawn used to be a sideline guy and then he acquired power jahvid im sure will grow into the same type of role
899074 i mean im a lot stronger i feel like im even faster maybe ill have more weight to throw around but it feels the same to me
899075 it may be as a returner it may be in the backfield it may be in the slot catching balls hes a very versatile guy in that way
899076 officials told us if liu could not win a gold medal in beijing all of his previous achievements would become meaningless

899085 this has been a really horrible year with all of the injuries and stuff
899086 this puts it all in perspective we have lost one of the greatest figures in the city of atlantas history
899087 i thought he was doing a lot better i thought he had more energy this week and seemed more like his old self its like losing a family member
899088 tomorrow a baseball game will be played by a lot of young men with heavy hearts
899089 this has been a really horrible year with all of the injuries and stuff this puts it all in perspective we have lost one of the greatest figures in the city of atlantas history
899090 i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits
899091 weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
899092 back in our lean years when we werent very good he was able to entertain with sarcasm
899093 then when we turned things around and starting winning every year he made the transition and had the opportunity to make the greatest call in atlanta braves history
899094 it was just fitting that he got to do that because he meant so much to this organization
899095 fly ball deep center field grissoms on the run yes yes yes the atlanta braves have given you a championship listen to this crowd a mob scene is on the field wohlers gets them 1 2 3

899107 my basic explanation is that most of the oil reserves in world are controlled by state owned oil companies
899108 its the explicit policy of opec to keep supplies tight and prices high and other countries like russia agree so exxon becomes kind of a free rider to that problem
899109 the historical perspective is that the oil companies always blame the environmentalists the environmentalists and consumer groups blame the oil companies and no one points the finger where it belongs which is opec
899110 we sent a helicopter to rescue six people including four dutch and two italians
899111 they are at different spots at altitude of about 5 500 metres
899112 many countries now have realized that the shame that falls upon them from a positive test at the games themselves is something they want to avoid so they put their athletes through rigorous testing before they leave
899113 its taken quite a while for the countries to put it into practice
899114 now its really kicking into gear in most parts of the world and that shows how big the problem is
899115 the chances of them getting away with it are fast reducing so its a very silly risk for them to take
899116 if they do get caught here they are either stupid or their advisers are very stupid the shame they bring upon themselves their family and their country is insurmountable
899117 kami selalu menunggu bupati supaya segala tuntutan rakyat nisel terealisasi
899118 kita tidak habis pikir kenapa sampai saat ini permasalahan sampah di nisel tak kunjung teratasi padahal kita selalu mempertanyakan masalah ini pada petugas pengangkut sampah namun mereka petugas pengangkut sampah red terkesan tidak peduli akan keluhan kami selaku pemilik rumah makan
899119 hingga saat ini dinas kplh tidak memiliki mobil pengangkut sampah sehingga kita secara langsung tidak terlibat dalam hal pengangkutan sampah selama ini mobil truk yang biasa dilakukan mengangkut sampah milik dinas kimpraswil sedangkan kplh sendiri sejauh ini hanya bisa menyediakan tong sampah kendaraan roda dua dan tiga pengangkut sampah

899174 research shows only one in three british drinkers have tried real ale which is a real growth opportunity for british pubs facing unprecedented pressures from the credit crunch falling consumer confidence high tax rates and increasing utility and raw material costs
899175 now is the time for campaigners and the beer industry to work together to get british people to try and to appreciate real ale
899176 our culture and heritage is intrinsically linked with ale as a great british product brewed and enjoyed sociably in community pubs for generations yet most people havent even tried it
899177 real ale is growing its share of the on trade beer market as consumers abandon global brands and search out natural often locally brewed ales with real provenance
899178 im really looking forward to visiting the gbbf and mingling with passionate ale drinkers as i really enjoyed brewing my own beer with the team at marstons and can thoroughly recommend a pint of nightwatchman
899179 the way forward is clear local authorities must be given the discretion to apply common sense and relieve rates on unused and underused property
899180 if disaster is to be averted that will need to be done quickly because the bills have already been sent out and the court orders for non payment are already being applied for

899187 when you were a kid do you remember when you dropped a coin that rolled under the table how you didnt even think about what to do you simply threw yourself to the ground and went crawling after your money it didnt matter if it was just a nickel or even a penny you chased after that shit and now as you grow older do you notice how the value of the dropped coin youre willing to chase after keeps getting bigger and bigger at one point you stopped crawling after pennies because after all it was just a penny soon after nickels werent worth bending over for in no time at all dimes are more trouble than theyre worth with age comes the realization that the time effort and energy required to retrieve dropped money requires careful calculation is the quarter that just fell out of your pocket worth the risk of straining your back while bending over to pick it up what can you get with a quarter now a days anyway today i dropped a dollar bill while pulling my ipod out of my pocket as i stood there watching my money gently tumbling down the sidewalk in the breeze it then occurred to me that i must be an old man now because i had no desire to go after it then suddenly in a desperate bid to reclaim my childhood i went chasing after my dollar just as i bent over to pick it up my 180 oakley sunglasses one of those ridiculously expensive purchases you try not to regret fell out of my jacket pocket and got a nice scratch on the lens standing there with a dollar in one hand and my ruined sunglasses in the other i threw the dollar bill into the air and walked away having learned a valuable lesson sometimes youve just got to tell your inner child to go fuck themselves

899219 one thing that seems to get peoples attention is if you scream fire

899233 i sometimes think she doesnt know what shes doing and doesnt care
899234 i had worked there for 19 years and never received anything but positive performance reviews
899235 i never received an oral warning about anything then i was fired without warning contrary to university policy and almost certainly in violation of federal law
899236 shulers problem arose not because he blogged nor because he did so from his workplace because its clear he didnt
899237 his problem came from the fact that he wrote critical well received insights targeting a number of very powerful figures in alabama starting with u s attorney alice martin and prominent republicans with which she is aligned and including a number of major figures in the alabama media
899238 mr shuler has made in writing and in person numerous allegations against various individuals to my office which if memory serves deals with civil litigation
899239 many of his allegations are set forth on his blog
899240 the us attorney when receiving complaints refers them to an appropriate federal or investigative agency as we do not investigate cases
899241 his complaints were forwarded to the us postal inspection service as i advised him in my email as he asserted the mails were involved he was also advised to contact the alabama bar association he met with an assistant us attorney and presented no evidence of an offense only has opinions and was referred to agencies that could conduct an independent investigation i have no knowledge of him contacting those agencies
899242 there has been no contact by the office to mr shulers employer
899243 how would you define an outlaw i would say its a person who operates outside the law and gets away with it
899244 by that definition alice martin u s attorney for the northern district of alabama is an outlaw comforting thought for those of us who live in martins district
899245 is it possible that alice martin is the worst u s attorney in american history
899246 schnauzer does your employer uab know you blog at work
899247 you were verbally counseled on april 15 2008 for failure to seek authorization for time off and for failure to document work time in our billing system during this counseling session you displayed belligerent and threatening behavior towards your supervisor and received a written warning for your actions
899248 ive never had a client claim i overbilled them or falsified their billing in any way
899249 pam powell approves our billing and she reviews our timesheets if i had done anything wrong in timekeeping it would have been with her blessing
899250 a representative from uab it testified at the hearing that his investigation showed i had never written anything on my blog from uab equipment
899251 i have printed news items things to keep for my story ideas file and they are claiming that was non work related activity in fact keeping up with such news items is a part of my job description
899252 i spend most of every work day writing my own stories conducting research for my stories or publications copyediting my colleagues stories proofreading projects that are either my own or my colleagues
899253 i constantly use the web to check or verify information its a critical aspect of my job and of my coworkers jobs not only is this activity work related it is required of my job
899254 no as i said before that is inaccurate but we cannot comment further on this personnel matter
899255 in the end the shuler case is definitely about the first amendment and whether it will be a dead letter in alabama
899256 there are certainly a number of folks at uab who obviously wish it were dead they may be in for a very unpleasant surprise
899257 i am disgusted obama will not receive my vote in november regardless of whether it means mccain wins at least hes being honest with us once again dems picked the wrong guy in the primaries time to leave the party i guess
899258 can i get my money back this candidate appears to be defective
899259 i do not believe barack obama i will go further i do not want to believe him because the alternative is worse because if obama believes the bs he said about the fisa capitulation bill then he is not fit to be president if barack obama really believes this about the fisa capitulation bill then he is as dangerous as george w bush
899260 while this legislation does strengthen oversight of the administrations surveillance activities over previous drafts in many respects the oversight in the bill continues to come up short
899261 even as we considered this legislation the administration refused to allow the overwhelming majority of senators to examine the warrantless wiretapping program this made it exceedingly difficult for those senators who are not on the intelligence and judiciary committees to assess the need for the operational details of the legislation and whether greater protections are necessary the same can be said for an assessment of the telecom immunity provisions on an issue of such tremendous importance to our citizens and in particular to new yorkers all senators should have been entitled to receive briefings that would have enabled them to make an informed decision about the merits of this legislation i cannot support this legislation when we know neither the nature of the surveillance activities authorized nor the role played by telecommunications companies granted immunity
899262 its interesting to consider how clinton would have voted were she the nominee and theres no way to know now
899263 kudos to clinton its ironic so far i suppose that clinton is of late a more reliable ally than obama at least on this issue
899264 its time to put the obama caved on fisa talk to an end
899265 the fisa bill is obviously imperfect but i do not believe that a serious presidential candidate can afford to vote no on legislation that is intended to help prevent terrorist attacks if obama were to oppose the bill as a whole he would be handing mccain who didnt even bother to show up and vote today a huge opening to scare voters and paint obama as weak on terrorism
899266 democrats must always stand against republicans on national security because republicans have proven miserable failures on national security and yet still try to politically intimidate democrats by painting them as weaklings yearning to surrender
899267 the netroots went with the equivocator barack obama brazenly lied to them about his intent to filibuster fisa and they support him anyway and now they have to go give him some more money so that he can lie to them some more

899272 we went to vote because if you dont the zanu youth today or tomorrow move door to door and check your finger to see if you voted if not they will beat the hell out of you or demolish your home so to be safe you need red ink on your finger god its terrible what they are doing i wish it all comes to an end
899273 things are quite difficult now in terms of food and the z value but you are helping a lot to our people in terms of the food pack project and the wages that we are getting which are inflationary adjusted and is helping a lot so many people are being helped
899274 the run off election dates are now fast coming and the political violence is now increasing at an alarming rate political bases are now very common in our community where the youths are operating from mobilising support in what ever form we are still managing to work but i think as from tuesday next week it wont be possible to work anymore that whole week up to friday the election day it will be rallies all over the place i was in mbare this morning it was all rallies now in chitungwiza you have to drive your car with his poster on the dash board so the trick is you put it under the seat and when you see them ahead you just pull it and throw it on the dash then you can pass i think we will be able to go back to work on the 4th of july i think by then we will be able to see where the wind is going
899275 ive been struck by the speed and decisiveness of his move to the center
899276 reinforces that if we act responsibly we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe
899277 if obama doesnt do what moveon wants it will show some degree of independence
899278 hes a good politician hes doing all he can to make sure people know he would govern as a post partisan moderate
899279 in a way that provides them a motivation and incentive to vote
899280 is to get people to see how liberal he is
899281 an ex post facto law which would clear the phone giants from responsibility for their systematic aggressive and blatant collaboration with bushs illegal and unjustified spying on americans under this flimsy guise of looking for any terrorists who are stupid enough to make a collect call or send a mass email

899292 in the early 1970s we discovered bluefin tuna north of the canso causeway
899293 a friend had all the gear to catch it we went out and within an hour we had a strike it took 3 hours but we landed an 800 pound bluefin
899294 because it was caught with sporting equipment the federal government legislated that all tuna fishing be done with sport gear its still on the books but im not sure if its being observed because it was fished with sporting gear it meant less depletion of stocks our fishermen even charter their boats to sport fishermen from the states and elsewhere who then give their catch back to our people to sell
899295 i got harvesters interested and the industry ran for many years until disease set in and we lost the product on the eastern shore there are still a few spots in cape breton but the catch is nothing to speak of the last couple of years japan is the only market for sea urchins where its used in high grade sushi
899296 i put out a call for interested kids 12 and under and thought id get a dozen or so fifty seven showed up we formed a league and by the next year had sponsors uniforms and 700 to 800 people attending our games a couple of years later there were lots of coaches so i dropped away
899297 we called it a return to tradition and had a great event with dances pageants suppers and dinners boat races sporting events concerts fireworks and childrens events weather put a bit of a damper on it this year but we still had great attendance
899298 ive never seen a fine weather day on nov 11 but the veterans really look forward to the beef stew i make
899299 its because of the people i like to keep from being bored and feel i have to entertain others so they wont be bored i hate to see potential wasted
899300 if you dont step in and help with the development of people the potential goes to waste
899301 most people hate to do it but they sure enjoy the results
899302 you could tell from their body language as they were being introduced that they were uncomfortable being honoured
899303 volunteering is an attractive social arena all volunteers have something in common and they are happy to be together sharing it and providing activity for others
899304 i didnt have a husband and two kids at home but
899305 i dont think ill ever say retirement thats too final
899306 every opportunity throughout those 40 years anne has made a commitment to her community
899307 a series of eight different gardens including a cottage flower garden one with herbs for cooking and medicines and dying fabrics heathers and heaths grains vegetables fruits and local plants plus a woodland trail
899308 forges and gardens were an integral part of community and family life for the early settlers of the cape breton highlands
899309 he took out a big can of pepper spray and sprayed the whole can in my face all i saw was a big bulk of red stuff coming toward me like sand and he ran for the door
899310 its like needles this burning feeling the eyes just burned all i could do was put cold water on it
899311 we do log peoples names for the basic reason that if they use it illegally and if the police come by and want to know if they bought pepper spray we tell them
899312 it didnt even cross our minds that people would use it for anything else
899313 i think it would be naive for any intelligent person to think that people are buying bear spray for bears
899314 they have to make sure a person understands why they are buying it what they plan to use it for and also have to make sure that they advise the purchaser that if you use it for any other purpose then you are using an offensive weapon
899315 we still have access to it we just dont want to have quick access to it here for someone who is just buying it as a lark
899316 ever since it became available in halifax there were increases in the abuse of bear spray so kids were using it in the street it wasnt the bears who were getting hurt it was the people who were getting hurt so we decided here not to carry it
899317 what would have happened if i hadnt turned back and he had attacked me
899318 they could be charged with assault with a weapon or possession of a prohibited weapon
899319 the hands got a lot of pepper spray in em
899320 theyve swelled up and they burn so every few minutes i dip my hands in the cold water
899321 i dont think anyones going to stop it theyre selling it as a bear spray not as a weapon so hunters will buy it
899322 will be the first step in a process spider man will continue i cant tell you every person who will be involved
899323 it would be great to have everybody back but no one is going to sign on the dotted line until we have a script these are the questions being discussed now the one thing we have answered definitively is there will be more spider man movies we just havent answered what shape they will come in and sony hasnt given us a release date
899324 almost forgot you dont like strawberries on a strawberry cake
899325 you dont have to stay with me anymore i dont want to bind you down with guilt i know your heart yarns for xin yi and thats where you should be you can go
899326 do you think i would leave you and go after chen xin yi in this state i know youve always been insecure you would wear your heart out for something you want youve danced till your ties bleed for your mothers smile youve lowered your pride to lie to chen xin yi in order to keep me by your side but did you know some things once you own it it will stay with you me for example even if we are no longer boy and girlfriends i wont pretend i didnt know you same with dance you dont have to dance on the stage in ny to be the prettiest odette as long as you are dancing you will radiate beauty and confidence
899327 but i cant anymore i cant dance cant teach i didnt like kids before but watching them dancing with diligence makes me regret not having a baby with you when you wanted one and making you and chen xin yi lose your baby
899328 if you think you owe me something promise me one thing dance for me
899329 i didnt know you wanted me to come that badly
899330 who wants you to come i know i dont im leaving
899331 youve got yourself quite a temper over the two years i kinda miss the gentle and tame post it girl
899332 see youre hard to deceive you dont fall for the lies
899333 what you saw the other day in the hospital is a misunderstanding
899334 what misunderstanding ive seen it all dont tell me youre gonna say i need to check my eyes
899335 you dont need to check your eyes what you saw isnt what you think it is
899336 if what i saw wasnt the truth then what is
899337 what do you mean your feeling towards me is real
899338 even if you kill me ill still only love chen xin yi
899339 whats the use of loving her she doesnt even love you back
899340 you say you like me but does liking me mean you can play me like a toy
899341 im not toying with you i did what i did because i liked you
899342 then if i tell you to die would you do it
899343 dont worry when you get married ill buy you lots of good stuff
899344 wow youre really good how long have you been skating

899349 i went through a divorce its been about 2 years now saturday is what would have been 4 years of marriage over it well its like an anniversary of failure for me i was in a long distance relationship on and off for awhile i gave alot more i fell in love then it ended and not by my choice i have a 3 year old we have her 50 50 she helps me sleep at night some nights i wake up and i wonder why why am i like this some days i cant breath i cant breathe because i have anxiety it got to the point where running boxing and my general breathing techniques didnt work i dont think im going through a delayed reaction of pain i think ive just been stuck in the stage of sadness the sadness i think turned into depression i never went to a doctor and been diagnosed or anything but it was to the point where i didnt wanna leave my house and hang out sometimes i wouldnt answer phone calls cuz i just wanted to be by myself dating should i be marriage it scares me am i overly optimistic i work long days and keep myself extra busy so that when i get home at night i pass out so i dont have to think about my life and reality i go to new york in a couple of days getting away helps kristina on 6 7 hours of sleep at night im good kristina on barely 4 hours im running low on fuel here im still hurting
899350 ngf is excited to have a found a partner whose creative executions jump out of the mail stack in a positive and engaging way we believe drives unique personalization technology when coupled with our best in class mailing lists will generate golfer interest and action the partnership establishes a one stop resource for golf courses interested in moving the revenue needle
899351 the berger foundation understands the rotation adjustment for the 50th anniversary and is anticipating added events for the classic club that will add financial support for valley charities along with the bob hope chrysler classic event
899352 we are looking forward with great anticipation to our 50th anniversary tournament
899353 we are excited about the courses in our 2009 rotation and we know they will offer excellent competitive conditions for our professionals and amateurs
899354 classic club is a wonderful challenging course donated to the tournament by the berger foundation
899355 it provides the bob hope chrysler classic organization with significant flexibility now and in the future because the tournament format includes the use of private clubs the rotation is set annually thus in 2010 and beyond the rotation will be reviewed for the good of the tournament
899356 leading the driver count at these prestigious events and all the other major championships to date in 2008 clearly demonstrates that these talented players trust the performance of fujikura shafts in the most challenging competitions with the worlds most talented fields
899357 our continual success is the result of the great technology and teamwork by our tour representatives and our oem clubmaker partners
899358 being the leading driver shaft brand at these majors is particularly exciting because these accomplished golfers know that precisely fitting shafts can definitely improve performance on very demanding courses
899359 were honored that these pros continue to show their confidence in the innovative material design and technology and superior performance of fujikura shafts when matched with our oem clubmakers
899360 we did not expect that this rating would be so high because many golfers have a poor grip that they have been using for years we thought that it would take quite a bit of practicing and playing to make the transition to a good grip that did not seem to be the case with the proplay glove amp grip fitting system
899361 this is a dramatic improvement and probably the best result a golfer would like to see because of the importance of hitting your shots straight at the target
899362 at footjoy we are dedicated to manufacturing the very best golf gloves in the world we take special care in the design development and manufacture of every golf glove to ensure this essential piece of equipment performs at the highest level of every golfers game

899384 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
899385 he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
899386 its really out of my control as much as it affects our team and it affects me personally with him coming back its out of my control
899387 i wasnt really worried about it and now that hes back i guess i have a shot to compete
899388 favre is en route to green bay folks and we understand he opened a bag of pretzels at 35 000 feet

899391 the press shall have the right to report and publish freely within malawi and abroad and to be accorded the fullest possible facilities for access to public information
899392 arent the state broadcasters serving the interests of the public by broadcasting health educational agricultural environmental and other social programmes
899393 journalists have a responsibility to provide the public with accurate information they should also conduct themselves with propriety all times when performing their duties
899394 political intolerance and demonisation of certain individuals in our society
899395 we therefore call upon the concerned parties to consider seriously curtailing such programs or giving them a different direction and orientation
899396 we told them that we have no resources to travel from blantyre to lilongwe to meet them as parliament refused to approve our funding from government i dont know why they want to meet us maybe they want to ask how we are starving
899397 the committee offered to fund the dg and his deputy but we told them that they have to fund us including the mbc board but even if they accept to do so i dont think they have any right to summon us we have been operating on our own resources and why would they need us to account for that
899398 bootlicking gossip and the new format of shameful reporting have emerged at mbc

899408 i start the album off with the obama speech not just because im african american but because i really feel like hes a fresh new voice and alternative from what weve seen in the political scene in some time i see similarities in his way of thinking and my way i really like him a lot
899409 my husband died after a long suffering persistent coughing recurrent fever chronic diarrhoea skin rashes loss of weight lack of appetite and night sweating tortured him during seven months of his illness
899410 the problem is that my husband believed that anyone with tb is hiv positive as far as he was concerned it was a waste of time for a person suspected to be hiv positive to go for treatment as the aids causing virus has no cure
899411 i was diagnosed tb smear positive but hiv negative even after those results i failed to convince my husband to go the hospital
899412 i am a healthy person now but i still weep for my deceased husband who died after refusing to go for tb treatment if he had accepted to go for tb treatment he would have been cured and would have been alive
899413 hiv aids has therefore complicated the fight against tb because it has increased tb cases and death rate hiv aids has also increased the demand of resources in terms of human financial and logistic in terms of coping up with this scourge
899414 tb is too often a death sentence for people with aids we cant fight aids unless we do much more fight tb as well
899415 we are tackling tb and aids using a collaborative approach this entails that patients who present with hiv as a health problem are also screened for tb and patients who present with tb are also screened with hiv
899416 the tb patient by criteria is eligible for the provision of arvs therefore the tb patient receives arvs
899417 when poverty marries the twin epidemic of hiv and tb the honeymoon is obviously disaster
899418 tb has biological causes and social causes biomedical cures and social cures
899419 tb cannot be either understood or adequately addressed when divorced from the social context
899420 poverty tb and hiv aids form a lethal combination each speeding the others progress hiv promotes rapid progression of primary tb infection to active disease poverty drives tb patients to default medication people who have nothing to eat are reluctant to take drugs because they make them hungry patients who have no food dont take treatment
899421 a low socioeconomic status among the population coupled with a poor healthcare system in general is the likely explanation for high hiv mortality rates due to tb
899422 new tb infection is not just the product of poverty but also creates poverty
899423 i have lost hope as i await my death in december last year i went for hiv and tb tests i was diagnosed hiv negative but tb positive after the diagnosis i was put on a standardised short course chemotherapy regimen of six to eight months with direct observation
899424 my painful cough with thick cloudy and sometimes bloody mucus still continues when i cough i have to endure painful rapid heartbeats i still feel fever chills night sweats fatigue and muscle weakness
899425 if i am not suffering from aids and yet tb drugs cant cure me of this lung disease then what am i suffering from
899426 the drugs i bought from the black market and took for thirty days managed to cure me of syphilis symptoms that had been bothering me since then it was my habit that every time i suffered from syphilis or any sexually transmitted diseases i simply rushed to the backstreet market to buy rifina as treatment
899427 if i would not have used drugs being sold illegally on the black market certainly i would not have suffered from this difficult to cure multi drug resistant tuberculosis
899428 the stolen drugs are often used to treat ailments other than tb the indiscriminate use of the medicines is leading to the development of mdr tb which is very expensive to treat and due to scarcity of financial resources leads to death
899429 the difficult part of it is that it is expensive to treat people with mdr tb because such patients need special isolated facilities while it costs government us 80 to cure ordinary tb in one individual it costs government us 6000 to cure mdr tb in a single individual
899430 yes we will win the war against tb we are actually winning
899431 malawi government is committed to fighting tb hiv aids and poverty
899432 it is actually a policy that tb patients who are on treatment get fortified food
899433 we are fighting the lung disease and the war on tb will easily be won once many people are sensitized and have realized that tb is curable regardless of ones hiv sero status
899434 we are tackling the twin epidemic of tb and aids through collaborative approach which entails that patients who present with hiv are also screened for tb and those with tb are also screened for hiv
899435 after effectively treating over 600 000 tb patients in the past ten years and malawi being dubbed as a success story in implementing dots the challenges of the triple epidemic are being overcome

899562 it seems like a common error in software project management is in treating all the stuff that developers do as a manufacturing activity this seems to be a driver behind a lot of poor management decision making and unrealistic goal setting
899563 since programming is a design activity not a manufacturing activity you shouldnt automatically think you can treat programmers like assembly line workers might help explain why throwing more programmers at a project that is behind schedule will hurt it not help it
899564 no man has a good enough memory to make a successful liar

899568 matt cassel has had a good camp hes had a real good offseason he did a nice job in the spring gutierrez is as probably as hard a working player as we have on this team hes worked hard to get better and build off of last year
899569 kevin has made a lot of improvement from the spring he seems a lot more comfortable and confident hes playing quicker at the line of scrimmage than what he was in the spring
899570 im confident that matt this is his fourth year has got a pretty good understanding of what were doing and hes done a pretty good job of it when hes gotten an opportunity to play
899571 i think ive gotten better each and every year i think ive gotten better with the system i know where we want to go with the ball so youve just got to continue to work and hope that the opportunity comes about somehow
899572 for the most part a lot of us young guys this will be our chance to kind of get out there and kind of play without holding anything back so were all looking forward to it
899573 i think the biggest thing is to compete against yourself
899574 its not personal with the other guy i think were all trying to see how well we can do and how quickly we can progress here
899575 it will be interesting to see oconnell play it will be interesting to see gutierrez play with a year under his belt
899576 when he played last year at this time he had very few snaps very little experience and won a spot on the team ill be interested to see how those two guys do
899577 i dont think its something that we can worry about
899578 we just come out here and try to get better every day and whatever is supposed to happen will happen
899579 everybody goes through them at some point you cant worry about what has happened in the past you just have to worry about moving on and doing your best to fix what you can now and get back out there as soon as you can
899580 just a tough time ive never really had a lot of injuries
899581 im just trying to do my best to get healthy and move on past last year
899582 at first i didnt feel the defense was coming as fast as i needed it to
899583 but as of now and the past week i feel like its starting to come to me and as it starts to come to me ill be able to play like myself and be myself out there
899584 weve actually become pretty close just being here for the short time that weve been here
899585 we talk we help each other we try to answer each others questions if we have them were both still learning
899586 hopefully we will keep that streak going for a long while and hopefully i got those first day jitters out and ill be able to roll from there
899587 it puts you more in the real setting so the next time you do it there isnt that little bit of the awe factor for the younger players
899588 at least they have already been through it once hopefully we will be out there late enough that we will get a little bit of time under the lights i dont know if it will be totally dark but it will be darker than what we have practiced in
899589 not that these guys havent played under the lights before but it is like anything else it will be the first time in quite a few months that any of them have done it so it will be a little bit of an adjustment

899594 once you locate the trailhead navigation is simple if you deviate much from the rock ledges that comprise most of the trail youll fall hundreds of feet down the mountains south face take utmost care on breakneck as carelessness has occasionally resulted in deaths when you reach the summit the surrounding landscape flattens out considerably you feel you can reach out and touch storm king directly across the water taurus looms to your southeast and the views of west point are unsurpassed relax picnic and enjoy the views while the climbing is arduous breakneck is not a long distance hike
899595 what is it about this game that makes me love it so much
899596 in these days together we have not overcome our problems or reinvented our structures that will still take time
899597 we may not have put an end to all our problems but the pieces are on the board
899598 and in the months ahead it will be important to invite those absent from lambeth to be involved in these next stages
899599 the vision of a global church of interdependent communities is not a vision of an ecclesiastical world empire or even a colonial relic
899600 the global horizon of the church matters because churches without this are always in danger of slowly surrendering to the culture around them and losing sight of their calling to challenge that culture

899621 you dont walk around with your chest out as much as someone who says oh im an eye specialist

899623 extra layer you have to go through like a wall has been erected now departments have to climb over the wall to get things done
899624 the whole purpose of this was accountability and to move the day to day operations quicker and faster so we can deal with the broader policy issues
899625 when the ordinance was being discussed the cao at the time indicated that there would be no costs basically associated with it
899626 however now in retrospect we find that its nearly a 2 million increase in net county cost so did the commission look at the increased costs to determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs
899627 the vehicle was just sitting in surplus the timing was just perfect

899629 i really love that community feeling i see that a lot of those communities dont have it they just dont have it and i really feel fortunate
899630 we are fortunately not a crime ridden city so we use it as an opportunity to show residents our police resources
899631 they basically provide a forum in which neighborhoods can talk to city staff and thats just an adjunct because the real benefit of the program is making community members aware of how to protect their property

899655 to many sports fans from here travelling to beijing it will seem absurd that neither they nor our athletes can show the northern ireland or ulster flags at the olympics
899656 but for people in china the repression of free speech is much more serious saying the wrong thing can land you in prison and many journalists and activists have been arrested
899657 local athletes taking medals at the beijing olympics should be able to do a victory lap with a northern ireland or ulster flag if they wish

899692 ha llegado la hora de que todos escuchemos los mensajes sobre el sida
899693 algunas farmac uticas no se comprometan lo suficiente para bajar el precio de los antirretrovirales

899742 rising commodity prices and their impact on the cost of food have heightened awareness of the vital role of agriculture
899743 across all our businesses we are intensifying our focus on emerging markets in order to bring the benefits of modern agricultural technology to countries where the need for productivity gains is most pronounced
899744 by promoting biofuels they are playing a part in the rising food prices that we have seen in the last few months and years
899745 they have always told us that we need genetically modified organisms gmos because there is a limited surface available for agricultural production but it is a contradiction to say we need to use this land to produce biofuels because this will have a negative impact on food security
899746 syngenta is also working on second generation biofuels which will use organic waste matter and not the food part of the plant
899747 syngenta believes that all farmers should be able to choose the best available technologies including gm to meet their crop production needs in a sustainable way gm is a safe technology that has been successfully used by farmers for many years

899764 we seem powerless to ameliorate conditions on the ground in the present crisis moment this peaceful prayer vigil since it focuses the minds of many millions on the different sufferings of tormented and tormentor alike is a powerful way to intervene and it does not preclude anything else we can think of and do further on i hope everyone who reads this will join in this important effort

899772 the golden thread touching all parts of the sugarcane industry
899773 the sugarcane industrys ongoing turbulent period has seen the number of growers drop from over 6000 to under 4000 in five short years
899774 the industry has been though a period of poor growing conditions and low returns which has weighed heavily on our growers bottom line and is compounded by the profit eroding high australian dollar and spiralling fuel fertiliser and other input costs
899775 this has led to a contraction of land available to cane growing putting pressure on production and paving the way for alternative uses of land
899776 the swing towards everything from hobby farming to trees to diversification into alternative crops is being felt across the industry and this is no less evidenced in the mackay area
899777 the mackay consolidation has been persued only after a great deal of consideration
899778 the concern of farmers is primarily directed at the hope for improved growing conditions and the recovery of production
899779 if these factors come together and better marketing conditions come into play the remaining three mackay mills could come under pressure in processing future crops

899824 intellectual freedom can exist only where two essential conditions are met first that all individuals have the right to hold any belief on any subject and to convey their ideas in any form they deem appropriate and second that society makes an equal commitment to the right of unrestricted access to information and ideas regardless of the communication medium used the content of the work and the viewpoints of both the author and receiver of information freedom to express oneself through a chosen mode of communication becomes virtually meaningless if access to that information is not protected intellectual freedom implies a circle and that circle is broken if either freedom of expression or access to ideas is stifled

899832 it would backfire shed be seen as dividing the convention shes very much been taking the high road on unity
899833 from what i can tell the hillary world is pretty resigned to her not being the vice presidential candidate an interesting question in retrospect why would she have made a deal with barack obama to help relieve her campaign debt if she was going for vp
899834 now youll probably see her be overtly and hyperactively supportive being the visible good soldier trying to squash negativity or disunity and make up with the left the african american world and other places shes got making up to do
899835 and youd presume obama makes it but if he doesnt that might mean she could come back there in the future
899836 i dont think it was ever a realistic option to place her name in nomination
899837 ultimately it was a matter of how shed repackage the brand
899838 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering
899839 if the camps had really been stupid and wasteful and tragic that meant that the soviet union was stupid and wasteful and tragic too
899840 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
899841 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life

899882 it was raining very heavily and the crowds had swelled immensely and as soon as the rain stopped people tried to rush ahead
899883 there was a man with his child and he was shaking the child to see if he was alive and all the time tears were flowing down his cheeks
899884 no one from the police or administration was helping and it was just people helping each other in the pouring rain
899885 there was total chaos everywhere and i saw dead bodies everywhere and blood soaked survivors crying for help
899886 i am so shocked that i am trembling in my house and terrified to step out and go to work
899887 the number of devotees is somewhat down but the pilgrimage is on and the devouts are going to pay their obeisance at the temple the number may be reduced because of the stampede and also due to the overcast sky and possibility of heavy rain
899888 the pilgrims have been asked to stick to their queue in an orderly manner and not get influenced by rumours police personnel homeguards and volunteers are ensuring that the devotees keep to their row

899892 and if i notice that my weight is going down quite quickly ill have some chocolate as well
899893 you can try to tell them what to eat but youll never succeed because whenever they go back home they just eat breadfruit rice and fish
899894 they carry excess weight but its just fat so they can lose 3 4 kg just like that if theyve got to come down before a competition they just come down

899897 some people call politics fun and maybe it is if youre winning but even then its a mean kind of fun and more like a rising edge of a speed trip than anything peaceful or pleasant real happiness in politics is a wide open hammer shot on some poor bastard who knows hes been trapped but cant flee

899899 entire civilizations have been done in by vengeful monsters claiming a special relationship with
899900 couch its what my family always called it in fact i dont think i called it a sofa when i was shopping for one today
899901 i call it a couch and not a sofa because thats what my parents called it
899902 now that you mention it my parents did call it a davenport sometimes too
899903 i like to attempt to keep it even yes i do actively think about this but i think couch is accidentally used more often
899904 im ambidextrous as i am a greedy wordy type although i draw the line at divan
899905 after much pondering i would say that my preferred word would be sofa although in some circumstances i might use couch

899907 when things come too easily we simply dont appreciate them
899908 never too late to cherish things around you and people too since nobody is legally bound to be with you and to like you it took a bunch of emails from columbia a cheap price to pay for all these
899909 why are you pulling people over who pay your salary but you couldnt manage to show up when we caught people dealing meth in our parking lot
899910 i would try not to call him that at school
899911 i can see him in heaven right now saying oh my god how embarrassing
899912 the fact that it was not the family but a neighbor who made the suggestion the fact that it was another neighborhood the street is technically in another neighborhood that approved the plan those things make it more special
899913 we raised our kids to make a difference hes still making a difference
899914 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
899915 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
899916 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
899917 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
899918 but you always knew you would get to do good work and work on good buildings
899919 as far as tucson goes its a pretty big deal working at ua
899920 whenever a ua job comes up well get people calling wanting work because they want to lay brick there its kind of a notch in your trowel
899921 i brought my son to the ua job this summer just to ensure that five generations have been involved in bricklaying on campus
899922 but tommy and i have really pushed them to make a living with their brains and not their backs
899923 kurts got an academic scholarship here at ua and i tell him look youre squandering a hopeful future with your brains for what
899924 you get a sense of accomplishment ill see what college does for me but id also like to do the apprentice program with cox masonry because i kind of feel it would be a shame to see the trade die out with my generation there arent many bricklayers out there
899925 most everyone in the past 30 years is more of a concrete block mason than a brick mason
899926 really the only brick you see here is tusd and ua you get guys who say i can lay brick but if youve laid block all your life youre not going to be able to lay brick
899927 they can work during breaks but this is a hard job and it gets harder all the time
899928 with a brick manufacturer downtown it was accessible and attractive
899929 these were stories about men in my day men who would show up for work in a white shirt and tie and at the end of a day of laying brick would barely be dirty because they were just that good
899930 you grew up seeing them as the princes of the trades it is hard to explain but when youre a young kid working out there with some of these old guys laying brick just gets under your skin and its hard to let go
899931 beginning in the 40s and 50s they started inventing concrete block and construction moved to that because brick was more expensive we do about 4 million in business annually and 90 percent of it is concrete block
899932 there will be exceptions but theyre usually far from the historic core
899933 were committed to what made us special in the first place and that includes red bricks red roof tiles and open spaces that said we dont believe we have to do the whole building out of red bricks anymore because it is cost prohibitive we utilize red brick in areas where it is visible and we dont put it where it cant be seen buildings arent built the old way
899934 with the ica facility we wanted to be sure the visible sides to the campus and community had red brick but the south side faces the swimming complex which is made of different material and we wanted those buildings to blend together
899935 and pay his research staff or subscription to bloomberg systems though he may reap higher returns his large expenses will even out the net profits
899936 is unfair cause if certain people would do what they know they should already be doing there would be no need to freak out
