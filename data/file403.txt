4030030 kami cuma membawa bantuan sedikit untuk memenuhi kebutuhan anak anak sekolah ini yang paling penting kita telah menjalin kasih persaudaraan terutama di antara anak anak kita
4030031 inilah suasana belajar anak anak dampingan kami dengan sarana seadanya tapi mereka punya semangat untuk belajar
4030032 saya kasihan anak anak belajar dan duduk di atas lantai
4030033 kami membawa anak anak ke tempat ini supaya mereka bisa mengenal dan melihat dari dekat kehidupan anak anak yang berkekurangan karena selama ini mereka bersekolah di sekolah yang memiliki fasilitas yang memadai dan didukung oleh orangtua yang memiliki sarana serba ada dengan cara ini muncul rasa kasih dan peduli mereka terhadap orang kecil
4030034 kami sangat senang karena mereka mengunjungi kami yang kecil dan membantu menghormati dan peduli terhadap anak anak kami kami juga berterima kasih kepada gereja yang telah membantu warga kami di sini yang bekerja sehari hari sebagai nelayan pemulung tukang becak dan tukang ojek sepeda

4030038 she will have to have a metal plate in her back to hold it together and keep her back in place theyve operated on her now and she is doing well but she is on high doses of morphine for the pain
4030039 if she hadnt had the operation she would have been paralysed but there is also a risk of her being paralysed after the surgery
4030040 when i got to the hospital i was shocked to see the condition she was in
4030041 her face was all smashed up she had a black eye and she had lost her eye lashes she has been unable to move for two days
4030042 we dont know her and dont trust her besides if a crowd gathers in the red square with transparencies it will be an unsanctioned action with all consequences
4030043 we were the first to establish a university standard laboratory directly onto a farm
4030044 we havent changed much in the buildings because we wanted to keep the historical values
4030045 the laboratory has its original features and people can come and see us doing our research
4030046 we hold events you can book onto and people can drop by the shop
4030047 we have a school of aromatherapy educational events farmers and scientists working together and exclusive products we are the only centre globally to offer these facilities
4030048 we do not tolerate gun crime and we take it very seriously
4030049 given the market environment we remain alert to changes in customer sentiment but our first half performance gives us increased confidence that 2008 pro forma revenue growth will be closer to 4 oer cent compared to our previous guidance of around 3 per cent

4030060 pinter offers the stuff actors want and with which they can do magic surface vitality of course but also an undertow of narrative and implied feeling which deepens the simplest remark in the spare complicated screenwriting of pinter yes no and maybe become words which do a hundred jobs
4030061 we never see maggie smith making love to peter finch we dont need to finch tells us about it more powerfully than any shot of flailing limbs could ever achieve and even more powerful because at second hand in anne bancrofts eyes we see a glare of pain and betrayal which tells us more about what went on than any mere showing could hope to show
4030062 el p simo dato de la inflaci n a n m s la adversa coyuntura econ mica
4030063 cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4030064 it s the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4030065 the dramatic off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4030066 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4030067 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isn t the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4030068 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding online gaming i look to the studies and conclusions of candie nolan who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician
4030069 certain stances on this online gaming matter can be ignored while others are much more crucial
4030070 we have spent so many resources trying to create reliable rng software using traditional algorithms and caculi theorems but have never really analyzed geometric proofs and associated logic as a means to perfect our efforts
4030071 in general spatial relationships are not trypically meant for use in random numbers
4030072 but were trying new things now that could yield very promising results
4030073 were hoping to try our new spatial studies this spring with
4030074 in the past weve worked hard with many sportsbooks but now realize our strengths are found in the digital gaming sector with specific success with online casinos as the year continues to progress well be sure to keep ahead of all new advancements

4030076 he is one of the best in the world at his game and we all want him to bring a medal back to crosby
4030077 its great that jamie came down to show his support my mates are encouraging me on its fantastic
4030078 without my family i would not be able to do this with my mum brothers and sister and my partner kelly i can
4030079 hopefully it will all be worth while when i bring that gold medal home and two year old charlie will talk about it forever
4030080 i was in my 20s when he died and i have never got over it we are in no doubt his cancer was caused by the radiation from the bombs
4030081 my dad has missed out on seeing me get married his grandchildren being born and we have all missed out on having him around
4030082 you cannot put a price on that but just to have the acknowledgement that this is what caused his cancer would be something
4030083 they have admitted the men flying through the mushroom clouds were affected but they will not admit those standing on the decks were
4030084 the uk government recognises the vital contribution service personnel played in the uks nuclear tests during the 1950s and understands its obligation to veterans
4030085 when compensation claims are received they are considered on the basis of whether or not the ministry of defence has a legal liability to pay compensation
4030086 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4030087 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
4030088 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
4030089 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
4030090 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events
4030091 the industry is facing the possibility of a serious threat caused by a combination of rising costs and the economic downturn that could result in delays and at worst cancellation of some of these schemes
4030092 no one predicted inflation at these levels and some projects may have to be scaled back
4030093 there are already arguments about who will pay for major infrastructure work such as crossrail and those debates are likely to increase as budgets climb
4030094 many buyers are taking a wait and see attitude naturally some feel uncomfortable buying a home which may be worth less in six months time
4030095 almost one in four buyers think they might struggle to get a mortgage however just one in 50 has actually given up on their purchase due to failing to find a suitable loan anyone keen to buy a home still has an extensive range of mortgage options
4030096 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4030097 the loss of the other malaysian players made me a little upset but i need to concentrate on the mens singles and try to get to the final
4030098 he was in good shape and played very well i was too slow to catch up in the beginning of the second game
4030099 its just like the 1990s when we spent nights on the streets shouting at the top of our voices
4030100 it was so silly i was so close to victory just three seconds until i would advance
4030101 the opponent made me sleepy then made a move im not used to
4030102 one thing about greg inglis is hes a loyal kid hes very important to what we do
4030103 ive played with greg for a long time hes very respectable hes very loyal and hes very much loved among this bunch of blokes at the storm
4030104 im sure hell make the right choice for him and hopefully thats with rugby league and particularly with the storm because hes valuable to what we do and hes a good bloke too
4030105 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
4030106 you turned around and just like that i started to fall your smile your eyes that look that could enthrall did just that and tore my heart from its place but i wont give you the time or even the space if you get to close you see there isnt much time when you take my love away you still wont be mine though if its ever worth anything i knew all along that given the chance you would forever be my song
4030107 it is better to love and loss than to have never loved at all
4030108 we felt like they were getting too high in numbers
4030109 we just want to make sure families are getting their money and parents are taking responsibility
4030110 because customers are calling us and local community action agencies we dont have a count right now
4030111 i have never imagined that i could win gold in the olympic games
4030112 my first thought after i touched the wall was wow ive won an olympic final
4030113 its a new generation and now its time to step aside
4030114 the best moment is when i turned back and i saw the number one next to my name
4030115 its huge unbelievable at any moment i felt that i could be beaten
4030116 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about or doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulation
4030117 was the person in the front of the store attractive one point for yes 0 for no
4030118 was the person at the cash register attractive 1point for yes 0 for no
4030119 our programs continue to make important progress and we look forward to reporting the results from the phase 3 trial for our lead candidate apf530 later this quarter
4030120 while our cash position is sufficient to complete the apf530 trial and move forward with other programs we also continue to evaluate strategic partnership opportunities that may provide non dilutive funding in addition to development and marketing assistance
4030121 i wanted to show that the olympics are above politics and i wanted to show a sign of peace
4030122 we are not playing the georgian team we are playing against our brazilian friends
4030123 if we go back we will be disqualified from the olympics
4030124 we wont be able to compete in the summer games or the winter games
4030125 normally in the games there is peace but russia turned it around
4030126 it is a difficult time but the government has a lot of hope for these athletes
4030127 it means very much for our country because of the conflict now
4030128 thank you to my country thank you to my people
4030129 von einer konjunkturellen eintr bung haben wir noch nichts gesp rt
4030130 wir liegen erneut ber den wachstumsraten des gesamten it markts
4030131 i came back last year and played 28 games and scored 10 goals i made an impact and ill do the same again this year whether it means ill play less games or more well see
4030132 no one has worked harder than him to try and get himself right and all he wants to do now is prove to himself and prove to everybody else that has doubted him that he has still got it and that he is still the harry that we used to see lighting up the premiership every week
4030133 i think that he just maybe wanted to get away from england
4030134 maybe i think his reputation had gone before him and he played less than he would like to
4030135 he just saw an opportunity for a fresh challenge but still in champions league football and the opportunity to play regularly and just to focus in a different country where maybe the distraction is less for him
4030136 i hope he does very well im sure with the ability he has he will and if he is playing regularly for galatasaray that means he is going to play well for australia and we are all going to benefit
4030137 its just beyond me to be honest that it took six years
4030138 the anthrax could have been from anywhere in the world
4030139 it would be the nations first integrated comprehensive biological and informational resource
4030140 with nothing more than todays technology tb research could take a quantum leap into the information age
4030141 i had actually thought what could that ever mean to me
4030142 the lesson i learned from the hantavirus case is that we really need to able to tell where a pathogen strain is originating
4030143 is it from spill an intentional release was it here all along and we didnt recognize it was it a non pathological form and now its dangerous or is it newly introduced like west nile
4030144 you can now sequence 2 billion bases in three days for 10 000 20 000
4030145 we are now at the point where the number of cases in the u s is slowly coming down
4030146 the question now is what else can we do to improve tb control the tb vaccine basically developed in the 1920s is 90 years old a very rudimentary vaccine
4030147 tb in other organs is not contagious and if treated one is never going to transmit it
4030148 thats why we need a vaccine to treat tb as a whole
4030149 and we dont tend to eat lungs in the u s
4030150 importing 300 000 cattle a year from chihuahua they need a rapid test for bovine tb
4030151 all these resources just happen to exist in new mexico at this time
4030152 we all know each other everybodys thought this through and signed on we could go very very quickly if we could just get the initial funding
4030153 once its going theres no question it will be sustainable it will be a process of attraction people will come because it meets a need they cant possibly get any other way

4030157 das war ganz klar unangemessen aber soweit wir wissen hat sich das team entschuldigt

4030159 i wasnt going to let him walk home by himself and he said he lived right behind the school
4030160 im a student and i work a part time job
4030161 the point is that animal control has never expanded to keep up with the growing population and the growing number of animals
4030162 the things that weve asked for are just a band aid
4030163 we have to think of the animals but we also have to think of our employees weve asked for improvements but weve asked for a band aid we need to make it better
4030164 id also like to request that a representative from the correctional facility be here at that time
4030165 i need some clarification on how much the parish is paying for outside municipalities
4030166 my mindset was always that jonny was going to go back to united
4030167 after the relay i was physically and emotionally drained so to get in and do another 53 point this morning was great
4030168 i have got a night off now so i can get focused and ready for tomorrow morning
4030169 i have been told if you can do something three times you can improve and i have swum three times in the high 53s so improving on that would be nice tomorrow morning
4030170 i dont know what its going to take to win it but if my time is good enough i will be more than happy
4030171 my goal was to make it through each round and get through to the final ive done that now so i can re evaluate my goals and hopefully do what i want to do tomorrow
4030172 continue to explore all available options in order to add an additional big man to our roster
4030173 i was surprised by the mistakes made by the u s team
4030174 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
4030175 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
4030176 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor
4030177 oh well records are meant to be broken it feels good but we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well
4030178 are getting better each game and what you can expect from spain is they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it
4030179 weve played them quite a bit through the years and we know well have to play well to move on to the next game
4030180 i said to my assistant coach maybe the lights will go out now and it could be over

4030218 environmental conditions are only marginally favorable for development and the potential for tropical cyclone formation in the next day or two has decreased
4030219 it is not out of the question to see a strong tropical storm or a minimal hurricane near the southeastern bahamas by late sunday
4030220 forecasts rapid intensification on tuesday and wednesday as it turns northward into the eastern gulf of mexico and comes ashore in the florida panhandle next thursday
4030221 because we have new leaders and they want to make sure theyre on the right course
4030222 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
4030223 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in airplanes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
4030224 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
4030225 this is not just air force it has to fit with strategic command and has to fit with the broader national security community
4030226 and were going to look at making sure that all those pieces fit together as we proceed
4030227 were just not getting it done can we get it done i dont know because were not getting it done your performance speaks for itself its not like theyre not trying weve got some weak spots can we get it done so far weve had a hard time proving it
4030228 thats with pitching thats with hitting thats with everything youre going to go into those periods when youre not going to pitch well or youre not going to hit well those shouldnt be very long if you plan on winning
4030229 the desire is there obviously sometimes you have to tip your cap to the other team for pitching well
4030230 sooner or later youve got to come to the conclusion that it is what it is
4030231 you say we can do better well yeah guys have better years at times therefore we can do better
4030232 hell never tell you that he cant play but by saying that its kind of sore and its throbbing all night you kind of get the feeling that its pretty rough
4030233 its just been a struggle as of late for him to get back to 260 or 270 get his head above water
4030234 i think i already have got off to a good start
4030235 im feeling positive vibes out here my routes are good im consistently catching the ball and im feeling confident about my game
4030236 just give me more opportunities to go out there and catch balls and make plays and everything will be great
4030237 i know its just preseason but its always good to get back into the season mode especially for a receiver you have to get the speed of the game down and get a little contact in
4030238 the last two seasons from midseason on reggie has played very well
4030239 reggie and i have discussed that and we are doing as a team and individuals everything possible to get him off to a faster start
4030240 im going to go out and make plays and do my job
4030241 it would be great if hes going to contribute if we have more receivers to go out and help the team thats awesome you want a deep squad the more the merrier
4030242 i had a tendency to work on my strengths instead of my weaknesses and i tried to reverse that this year
4030243 thats something i wanted to work on i went out and bought a couple of ball machines i put one in georgia and had one in jersey wherever i went i wanted to get catches and keep my eyes focused that helped me tremendously during this training camp because im so much more focused
4030244 the thing about me is i always get ahead of myself
4030245 i look back and think about the mistakes i made and then i think about the ones i might make as long as i stay right here right now that will help me as a receiver
4030246 just back from gascony gorgeous saw tim he says hi
4030247 anyway the north have you been horrid i mean sunderland whats the point
4030248 i met a northern chap once knew an awful lot about cricket but was in a terribly bad mood
4030249 with tamsins height at the net she is 193cm and her power and my experience and my ability to frustrate the teams because of my experience and putting the ball where theyre not hopefully it will be a good combination
4030250 you couldnt ask for anyone better to be partnering you at an olympic games really

4030252 the engineers have completed their preliminary studies and will give recommendations
4030253 depending on what the engineer studies show we may have to look for alternative sites
4030254 we are all very relieved that its just a bone bruise
4030255 i told him that there were a lot of worse places he could have gotten hit pitching hand pitching elbow shoulder face you name it
4030256 it just means that youre old and doing this and somebody keeps being silly enough to give you a job
4030257 we took it out of the locker and wore it had some fun with it up there a little bit
4030258 did some headfirst slides you slide a lot farther than he can down here
4030259 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4030260 i shouldnt have gone out there it was stupid im wasting the teams time by trying to go out there and be a hero
4030261 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you for example ryan is from st louis st louis it seems like they support their team theyre encouraging
4030262 i think that was probably about three weeks ago i think ive learned to overcome i cant affect that sort of outcome all i know is that i can go out there and throw one pitch at a time wherever they hit it so be it just try to limit the runs i felt i definitely did a good job of it
4030263 i just saw china come with a very big push
4030264 i tried to go up a little but it wasnt a very organized effort
4030265 when we started hitting the stands the noise picked up and we started saying hey lets give it a little bit more
4030266 before we knew it with 250 meters left we went for it because we could smell the finish line and it was good enough to get us qualified
4030267 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4030268 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
4030269 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
4030270 he is not from another planet he is from the future

4030286 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
4030287 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
4030288 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
4030289 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
4030290 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
4030291 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
4030292 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
4030293 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
4030294 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
4030295 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
4030296 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
4030297 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
4030298 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
4030299 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
4030300 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4030301 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
4030302 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
4030303 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
4030304 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
4030305 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
4030306 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
4030307 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
4030308 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
4030309 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
4030310 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
4030311 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
4030312 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
4030313 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
4030314 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
4030315 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
4030316 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
4030317 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
4030318 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
4030319 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
4030320 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
4030321 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
4030322 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
4030323 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
4030324 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
4030325 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
4030326 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
4030327 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
4030328 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
4030329 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
4030330 who are you how many hit records do you have

4030361 liberias wars since 1989 have cost tens of thousands of lives and left many people mentally and physically traumatized this conflict has been characterized by ethnic killings and massive abuses against the civilian population between 1989 and 1997 and again in 2003 and 2004
4030362 both female and male former combatants who experienced sexual violence had worse mental health outcomes than non combatants and other former combatants who did not experience exposure to sexual violence
4030363 like their female counterparts male former combatants who experienced sexual violence have worse mental health outcomes than both the general population and also other former combatants
4030364 rehabilitation programs that do not address this specific population risk failing a critically vulnerable group
4030365 this unexpected finding suggests that standard post conflict rehabilitation programs and gender based programs will need to adjust current programming to take into account males who have experienced sexual violence especially former combatants
4030366 apart from australia and japan my samples were small and confined to young middle class urbanites nevertheless this study is unusual because it covers so many nations and the comparisons offer some interesting food for thought
4030367 overall the results show that young men and women are divided on the issues of sharing housework and a womans right to have an abortion it should come as no surprise that young women are more in favour of domestic democracy than the young men while also being more supportive of a womans right to have an abortion
4030368 it is interesting to note that those in western countries tend to see sharing housework and role reversal as similar ideas whereas most of those from asian countries who are also supportive of sharing housework were quite opposed to role reversal while this might indicate to some people that greater equality exists in the western countries another interpretation is that it demonstrates the greater commitment to the fathers bread winning role in the asian countries
4030369 while performing housework and childcare was seen as nothing short of emasculation for many of the young men in my study this does not prevent them from claiming their rights in relation to abortion decisions
4030370 the chinese people surveyed were the most accepting of a womans right to have an abortion with both males and females seeing this as her decision in some cases the chinese responses asserted that both parents had responsibilities in relation to the child but it was the womans right alone to choose an abortion
4030371 sex love and feminism in the asia pacific a cross cultural study of young peoples attitudes
4030372 ab 2899 will revolutionize the way we do hiv testing in california and we strongly urge the governor to sign this bill
4030373 today in government funded programs extensive education and counseling is required for every person regardless of how many times they might have been tested treating the young person who is testing for the first time the same as a person in their forties or fifties who has been tested dozens of times doesnt make sense this important reform will allow ahf the largest hiv tester in california to do three times as many tests per hour as we do now the unanimous approval of the legislature for this common sense approach to hiv testing is very encouraging
4030374 this bill brings the requirements for hiv counseling in line with where we are today in our knowledge and understanding of hiv aids and other stds and it will allow us to focus our counseling efforts where they are most needed to those at high risk and those who may test positive
4030375 the california legislature has recognized the importance of this prudent public health legislation with its unanimous passage in both chambers when this bill is chaptered into law it will allow the department of public health and the state office of aids far more flexibility in its counseling regulations to best serve and reflect the needs of communities throughout california
4030376 amniscreen may offer reassurance to women concerned about unexplained vaginal wetness during pregnancy
4030377 its important to know when wetness may be caused by amniotic fluid leakage this new tool provides pregnant women with an effective way to identify unexplained wetness with easy to read results that should be discussed with their healthcare provider this important new test is an additional resource which may provide healthcare providers with information to help determine the necessity of a patient hospital or office visit
4030378 the airline industry is faced with twin challenges of slowing economic growth and high fuel prices to date industry has addressed higher fuel costs by putting up fares and applying fuel surcharges this tactic is likely to cease being viable in a softening demand environment the industry has not positioned itself to deal with oil remaining above 100 barrel and a simultaneous economic slowdown
4030379 despite a 20 drop in the share price year to date we think the stock trades on an earnings multiple that is still too high in light of the downside risk to earnings estimates
4030380 the real pressures for this stock come in 2009 as the combination of these falling volumes and 1 5 billion euros of fx raw materials headwinds drag on numbers we cut our 2009 eps forecasts by 45 and believe consensus has a lot of cutting to do too

4030385 i got over it got back into the gym and it was time to suck it up
4030386 there were a lot of people who thought he should have been on the team to begin with but as an alternate coming in hes been under pressure to do a great job and hes been absolutely tremendous

4030391 the situation is that kerry asked for an interpretation of rule from croke park which we didnt want to give because it is not our job to do that
4030392 i understand he trained earlier this week kerry have now been informed in writing by the ard sti rth ir p draic duffy that it is his belief and my belief that it is contrary to rule he has been told not to train and kerry have accepted that
4030393 what happened happened and we are not going to review that situation
4030394 kerry have been communicated with officially and they have accepted that
4030395 we were led to believe it was up to the kerry county board to interpret the rule as we saw fit
4030396 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4030397 there is a clear medical need for therapies that prolong graft function in kidney transplant patients and that more broadly inhibit fibrosis in other clinical settings
4030398 we have made rapid progress on stx 100 since obtaining the program from biogen idec last year this action by the fda should facilitate the development of this drug for transplant patients
4030399 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face
4030400 our interpretation of this is to suggest that the brain mechanisms that specialise in emotional response and especially in processing threatening stimuli regulate and intensify the processing of facial expressions by age 7 months

4030402 despite reductions in prevalence of infection among the general population of india women account for a rising percentage of all hiv cases with husbands risk behavior described as the major source of womens infection intimate partner violence ipv has been described as being associated with heterosexual transmission of hiv to women in india and elsewhere
4030403 in this first national population based study of the relationship of husbands violence against wives to wives hiv infection status as indicated via diagnostic testing married indian women who experienced both physical and sexual ipv demonstrated an hiv infection prevalence approximately four times greater than that of non abused women
4030404 prevention of ipv may augment efforts to reduce the spread of hiv aids
4030405 findings of the present study based on both the large population based sample and the use of standard diagnostic testing for hiv infection should serve to confirm the nature of this relationship and move public health policy makers and practitioners to increase recognition of ipv as a critically important target in the global fight against hiv aids
4030406 our studies also show that the eye contact between two persons and an averted gaze affect the functions of the neural mechanisms that regulate approach and avoidance behaviour another persons direct gaze prepares for an approach an averted gaze for avoidance
4030407 the deviations related to eye contact in people with autism are one of the earliest and most typical problems and our studies make it possible to find out why people with autistic behaviour avoid eye contact
4030408 these are not small amounts it is like saying we didnt give some of our houses to copeland homes or something it is basic stuff
4030409 the results show not only an improvement in the grades achieved but also an increased entry to mathematics sciences and languages which are positive and encouraging developments all round
4030410 there has been a big attempt to reverse the decline in science and we may begin to see the fruits of that this year
4030411 fourteen states banned forever amber as pornography the first was massachusetts whose attorney general cited 70 references to sexual intercourse 39 illegitimate pregnancies 7 abortions and 10 descriptions of women undressing in front of men as reasons for banning the novel
4030412 they who do not study history are doomed to repeat it
4030413 well if youre going to ban harry potter for having magic then you ought to take out
4030414 but then i got to the next entry on the list and
4030415 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
4030416 i n just 15 percent of cases both sides were right to go to trial meaning that the defendant paid less than the plaintiff had wanted but the plaintiff got more than the defendant had offered
4030417 if you approach a class of students and say ill either write you a check for 200 or we can flip a coin and i will pay you nothing or 500
4030418 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4030419 i would not say we are not pleased but where i would say we are not praising as much concerns the issue of spectators at some of the venues
4030420 you can take it as not being happy because i like to be performing at 100 percent i would like to have always all the stadiums full but if i compare it to past games i can be pleased because we are not the worst and we are even better in some of the events
4030421 at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
4030422 yes its true that we got questions from the sponsors and that they would like to see more people going to the showcases
4030423 we expected a jammed ballpark especially behind home plate you play a lot of international games in that fashion
4030424 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4030425 right now were just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
4030426 he had told me he had been working out and we put him through some things the last couple days
4030427 i think he has handled the last few days well
4030428 but im not naive to the problem either i want to make sure everything is set up for him so that he has a foundation there that he can bank on
4030429 it shook him up a little bit obviously but hes doing ok
4030430 in sri lanka last year there were bombs going off while we were there
4030431 but you did not feel threatened by it because you have got the security detail and the army give you escorts id certainly trust what icc security expert reg dickason says after spending some time with him so ill have to wait and see what he says
4030432 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back
4030433 inside me i think i would not have a problem id trust in them but then your family is saying you must be crackers and your girlfriend is saying i dont want you to go
4030434 it would be completely different if it was on moral grounds
4030435 and ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit

4030443 impoverisce la capacit di iniziativa delle pi importanti associazioni professionali degli insegnanti caratterizzate storicamente dal pluralismo presenti anche in territori poveri di risorse culturali impegnate al recupero della dignit professionale
4030444 senza preavviso e motivazione in modo estemporaneo e del tutto arbitrario
4030445 i motivi che hanno ispirato questa scelta e i criteri seguiti per le assegnazioni del personale dirigente e docente e le verifiche effettuate per stabilire il possesso dei requisiti di legittimazione degli enti destinatari di queste assegnazioni
4030446 la scelta del ministro particolarmente grave conclude lesponente del pd perch le associazioni che si vedono ridurre in modo unilaterale gli insegnanti loro assegnati svolgono attivit sociali spesso supplendo allo stato nella funzione di formazione e di ricerca per linnovazione della didattica
4030447 the problem often for movie transfers is that the movie is a single premise and a television show is an ongoing almost organic situation that has to have the ability to go from point a to point b to point c and move on
4030448 i was no help to my team going out there and being of no help trying to be a hero instead of saying you know what i cant do it its a stupid thing on my part if you cant do it you cant do it
4030449 but at the same time if hes hurting hes hurting if his back is bothering him he cant play
4030450 but at the same time i dont expect it to happen anymore
4030451 can we get it done i dont know because were not getting it done your performance speaks for itself its not like theyre not trying or anything like that weve got some weak spots can we get it done so far were having a hard time proving that
4030452 honesty and integrity are fundamental requirements of a registered nurse
4030453 while there is no doubt that the conduct was both wrong and serious the independent panel of the conduct and competence committee considered elphicks previous good history and evidence that her offending behaviour was out of character and the product of a number of pressures the committee therefore concluded that a caution order for five years represented a balance between public interest and the maintenance of public confidence in the professions
4030454 im mai war sicher dass ich nach deutschland wechseln w rde
4030455 i am much more interested in my fascinating self than in other people sure i love people watching but thats just because people are entertaining
4030456 its going to be very embarrassing for them spurs because it appears to be on the basis of a story in the sun i dont know where the hell they got those quotes from but it certainly wasnt from me
4030457 i knew you guys would say that was untidy but that guy is a twice pan american champion
4030458 and the reason the cuban isnt here is because alvarez knocked him out
4030459 in a normal competition i would have hauled back six points in the last round with those body shots
4030460 but they dont seem to be scoring body shots at all its unbelievable
4030461 although billy got beaten by a class act the scoring was a little inconsistent
4030462 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals
4030463 it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4030464 it will be different at anfield there we are expected to win and we will have our own fans behind us liege had their very noisy fans for the first leg
4030465 we were not surprised by the fine performance of the liege side we had seen enough of them to know they were a good aggressive side
4030466 the real surprise for me was the way liverpool played the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4030467 we will have to be a lot better in the second leg at anfield much better
4030468 we have been playing well in pre season looking confident and passing the ball well
4030469 but we did not do any of those things i did not want to bring steven gerrard on because the doctors had told me he was not fit enough to start the match
4030470 we waited until well into the second half before using him but we were not controlling the game and i had to bring him on
4030471 we know we can always rely on pepe to stop penalties but we have been told that the other effort may have been behind the line but these things happen
4030472 liverpool maybe came here asleep and not expecting this sort of game
4030473 maybe though we have woken them up for the second leg which will me much harder for us
4030474 we felt that if we did not lose this leg we would still be in with a chance we know though that we still have to score and that could be the problem
4030475 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing
4030476 id rather not but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to
4030477 id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
4030478 id love to if i can find the right movie
4030479 were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
4030480 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
4030481 it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy
4030482 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4030483 weve got a pretty noisy competitor out there you know it i know it its caused some impact were going to start countering it they tell us its the iway or the highway we think thats a sad message
4030484 we know that and we know it caused you a lot of pain it got customers thinking hey is windows vista a generation we want to get invested in
4030485 windows vista is an investment in the long term when you make the investment into windows vista its going to pay it forward into the operating system we call windows 7
4030486 from the 30th of june we have no longer been able to ship a pc with a xp license however what we have been able to do with microsoft is ship pcs with a vista business licence but with xp pre loaded that is still the majority of business computers we are selling today
4030487 we know a few of you were disappointed by your early encounter printers didnt work games felt sluggish you told us loudly at times that the latest windows wasnt always living up to your high expectations for a microsoft product
4030488 many said they would have rated it higher but wanted more time to use it themselves
4030489 we arent seeing any particularly substantive moves down in price on the windows side either in desktops or notebooks
4030490 that more also means windows vista which wont satisfy some shoppers
4030491 the windows vista compatibility center lists compatibility status for over 9 000 products 5 500 devices and 3 500 software programs
4030492 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the middle eastern gaming policy market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong middle eastern gaming policy usa companies that move forward
4030493 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
4030494 im getting calls from middle eastern gaming policy industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular middle eastern gaming policy company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
4030495 the recent news in the middle eastern gaming policy industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
4030496 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
4030497 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
4030498 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other middle eastern gaming policy entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
4030499 im pleased to report that technological advances by platter feltman inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most middle eastern gaming policy related companies and their subsidiaries
4030500 output of middle eastern gaming policy related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
4030501 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4030502 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4030503 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4030504 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern painted on the floor which we think showed respect to the chinese
4030505 but they are not they dont know who is the president of georgia i am sure
4030506 unbelievable a good deal for the sixers if they win
4030507 luckily there are incentive clauses i guess 80 million wasnt enough thank goodness there are incentives
4030508 in times like these it all sounds like monopoly money but this is the market its not out of line from either side this is a case where both sides won you cant say iguodala lost and the sixers know what theyre doing ed stefanski has done a pretty good job of turning this around hes a very straight shooter the sixers know what iguodala meant to the franchise
4030509 im a little shocked but this is a lot of money but iguodala made out by gambling i didnt think hed get that much hes a good player and hed be in the rotation of all the teams but there are teams he wouldnt start for to me its a lot for a guy who hasnt been an all star who hasnt been out of the first round of the playoffs
4030510 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
4030511 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
4030512 this is my first olympic medal i have nine world medals ill always remember this moment
4030513 a gold medal would have been a little better yeah but im walking away from this competition knowing that i have an olympic medal is a huge accomplishment my goal coming in was to have no regrets at the end of the day who knows this might be a once in a lifetime opportunity
4030514 when it comes down to the all around me and nastia are more than happy to go out there and represent the usa again
4030515 the whole time weve been here team has been really important but after getting this over with all around is next
4030516 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4030517 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4030518 the medico legal environment our members work in is increasingly complex and doctors are more aware of the potential medico legal problems they face
4030519 at the same time we are also assisting far more doctors with extensive investigations and inquiries into their practice
4030520 while it is important to investigate anything that might cause concern about a doctors practice we see at first hand how stressful it can be for our members those who are the subject of a prolonged gmc investigation may face two or three interim orders panel hearings followed by a fitness to practise hearing followed perhaps a year later by a review fitness to practise hearing before conditions placed on registration are amended such an ordeal is still rare but a letter from the gmc is understandably unsettling and members we are assisting can count on the support and medico legal expertise of an mdu adviser at every stage it may be even more reassuring to know that the outcome of cases handled by the mdu compares favourably with the figures published by the gmc in overall terms for example in 2006 the case examiners in the early stage of a gmc investigation concluded 42 percent of all the cases it considered whereas for mdu assisted cases the equivalent figure was 55 per cent
4030521 if it becomes apparent a claim cannot be defended successfully
4030522 the mdu claims department makes every effort to settle these cases as quickly as possible so that patients or their families receives their rightful compensation without undue delay twenty five per cent of settled cases are concluded by our expert claims handlers with the agreement of the member without the need to instruct a solicitor
4030523 we know from the feedback we get from members that they enjoy reading these case histories but we also think they provide food for thought as they are a useful way of shedding light on how doctors might approach some of the common dilemmas they face in practice we hope they will reinforce the message that if in doubt members should see the mdu as their first line of defence and seek advice from the mdu at the earliest opportunity
4030524 for too long lgbt issues have been given less favourable treatment than other areas of equality
4030525 with the introduction of legal protection for lgbt people in the provision of goods and services this event will provide a great opportunity for both service providers and individuals to discuss and influence future policies and outcomes

4030528 for the current fiscal year we are raising our earnings forecast to over 3 2 billion euros before taxes and nonrecurring items as things stand at present we also expect sales to increase to 53 billion euros
4030529 it is set to be one of the most mind blowing spectacles ever
4030530 if they dont want to come you cant stop them
4030531 if you dont know where youre going youll wind up somewhere else
4030532 banks losses from the u s subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the 500 billion mark as writedowns spread to more asset types
4030533 it just keeps spreading from one asset to another so its hard to know when these writedowns will stop
4030534 u s credit system remains crippled a year after crisis erupted
4030535 starting to realize that the stress in the credit market will persist for some time
4030536 the mortgage finance system in the united states has been badly damaged
4030537 there is definitely some reinvention that will need to occur and that will include some explicit involvement by the government
4030538 the bond vigilantes took law and order in their own hands and pushed yields up which would slow down the economy and bring down inflation
4030539 this time the bond credit vigilantes are refusing to go into the saloon and start drinking what wall streets financial engineers are mixing
4030540 it appears that every time we peel away this onion there is another layer
4030541 to the extent that home prices keep spiraling down the need for capital keeps increasing
4030542 it may be a step in the right direction but i am not sure it will solve all the problems
4030543 across the whole financial sector from the individual mortgage all the way up to private equity the system was lending on momentum in asset prices and not on the borrowers ability to repay
4030544 we dont address how things got so amazingly overleveraged we wont be fixing the system
4030545 the siding was the first to go then they took the fence then they broke in and took everything else
4030546 the war in georgia has left thousands of people without shelter food and medicine humanitarian disaster is inevitable unless something is done
4030547 we outplayed them for two innings and they outplayed us for seven
4030548 its one of those games you just really have to battle though
4030549 were really trying to come up with a clear system of accountability that parents can understand that students can click on and understand that teachers can understand
4030550 were looking at schools much more broadly than test scores
4030551 and were trying to give schools and principals a target for making accelerated progress
4030552 we hope these report cards are the beginning of a conversation at the school level about what schools value
4030553 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title

4030558 tijdens de verbouwing was de veiligheid en gezondheid van de kinderen op onze school onvoldoende gewaarborgd dat vinden wij niet acceptabel daarom zijn wij direct aan oplossingen gaan werken na overleg met de brandweer verwacht ik dat de school deze week weer geschikt wordt gemaakt voor onderwijs
4030559 the last 2 years from midseason on reggie has played very well reggie and i have discussed that and we are doing as a team and individuals everything possible to get him off to a faster start
4030560 i feel like i already got off to a good start in workouts
4030561 im feeling some positive vibes out here about what im doing my routes are good consistency catching the ball im feeling confident about my game as long as it tranfers to the season and to the games everything is going to be all right
4030562 thats great more receivers to go out there and make plays and help the team thats awesome you want that the more the merrier
4030563 i dont want to look ahead i want to stay right here right now every day one practice at a time as long as i do that and dont get ahead of myself then everything works out
4030564 mistakes you made mistakes you might make i need to stay right here right now thatll help me progress as a receiver
4030565 had a tendency to work on my strengths a little bit more than i have my weaknesses ive tried to reverse that this year
4030566 so wherever i went i would be able to get catches in and keep my eyes focused its helped me tremendously during this training camp because im so much more focused
4030567 i have him plugged in there to do that if i think that leg is getting fatigued or if he is giving an indicator that it is then well get him out of there i dont want to take any steps back there
4030568 i think he has handled the last few days very well but im not na ve to the problem either
4030569 i want to make sure everything is set up for him so that he has a foundation there that he can bank on
4030570 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4030571 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4030572 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4030573 we needed to have an offensive night like this that is huge for us
4030574 more than anything he is learning learning the pitchers and learning what to do in the clubhouse i know it has been a good experience for him we cant expect him to do anything more
4030575 the bullpen has been getting up and down a lot
4030576 it made sense to take me out but i would have liked to go one more inning
4030577 when they came up with computer scoring it really did not help us
4030578 most of our trainers are professional people who train their kids in a professional style that style does not do well internationally
4030579 when you have an argument with him doesnt he call people and tell them i hate him the difference is that these guys have access to the press and so when they say i hate him everybodys hearing it
4030580 everythings good hes a good guy were going to get through this not just me but our whole team
4030581 we have been speaking with nurses at education road shows around the uk and they all agree this is a huge undertaking and one that should not be rushed the new framework will effectively change the way tomorrows nurses practise so the nmc is determined to get this right the first time around
4030582 the modernisation and reform of health and social care in northern ireland is repeated across all four countries of the uk this changing nature of care delivery has challenged nurses and midwives to meet the needs of patients and clients in new and innovative ways these new ways of working are underpinned by the constants of caring compassion dignity and empathy
4030583 the benefit of a single uk regulatory body for nurses and midwives is that we can bring these new challenges and innovations back into pre registration training to ensure that nurses and midwives remain fit for purpose and practice at the point of registration this current review of pre registration nurse education will enable the four countries of the uk to continue to work together with the nmc to ensure that nurses are well equipped with the knowledge and skills to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future
4030584 this consultation has provoked a wide and timely debate within the profession devolution is providing greater opportunity for service providers to respond to the unique challenges in the various parts of the uk and ensuring we have nurses who are fit to practise in this varied landscape is essential it is encouraging to see that practitioners from across the profession are engaging with this important area of work and are helping to shape the future
4030585 the scottish government health directorates welcomed the opportunity to engage with nmcs consultation on the future provision of pre registration nursing education we are committed to close partnership working with all stakeholders to ensure that we continue to have educational programmes that support a nursing workforce that has the education skills and knowledge required to respond to shifting service demand and the needs of the people of scotland and the uk
4030586 i welcome this review of pre registration education for nurses as one of the vital components of our modernising nursing careers mnc programme
4030587 much of the way in which we practice as nurses and the values and principles that guide us is learnt in the earliest days of our career a high quality learning experience is therefore essential from the outset it is the foundation on which we build our professional lives
4030588 today a career in nursing offers unparalleled opportunities as well as great challenges in a rapidly changing and complex health care environment we must ensure tomorrows nurses receive the best possible education so they can meet the needs of patients clients and the public and continue to uphold the highest possible standard of care
4030589 as a minister for health and also as a nurse myself i am pleased that we have had this important opportunity to look at how we prepare our future nurses the needs of patients and service users are changing along with the whole of the environment of health care
4030590 what will not change is that people will continue to rely on their nurses to care for them in a compassionate manner keeping them safe helping them benefit from effective treatments when they are at their lowest ebb and helping them stay well and get the best out of life in the good times
4030591 making sure our future nursing workforce gets the very best education and training will help them reach the high standards expected of them i am therefore grateful to all the nurses who have taken part in this important work and look forward to working with the profession to take forward any future changes together
4030592 we all lived together several families and had so much fun the house was always filled with laughter jokes and tinkling of the bangles as women and children moved about with their daily routines while the men left for work
4030593 at the lowest estimate half a million perished and twelve million became homeless
4030594 i realise that patriotism is not enough i must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone
4030595 hey why would i want to give it away for free i paid money for this e book
4030596 his ability to get open and his ability to get downfield have been impressive
4030597 he can create separation and the quarterbacks have a lot of confidence in him which is pretty unusual for a rookie it didnt take long for them to figure out he was getting open
4030598 he is one of the faster ones that i have coached
4030599 there are a couple of things that he has that allows him to be a really fast learner first of all hes a natural player his movements are just natural he does a lot of things that we teach that he just does naturally secondly hes really sharp footballwise really for him it takes him once or twice maybe three reps and hes got it he can take it from the classroom to the field very quickly as well those are all good things weve got a long way to go and hes got a long way to go hes done a nice job up to this point
4030600 i felt like i did a pretty good job for the first nfl game
4030601 watching the film and watching my mistakes theres a lot i can get better on the biggest thing is just looking at film and see the things i have to correct
4030602 the offense is very tough not an easy thing especially for a rookie youve got to put a lot of hard work into it a lot of time you have to focus on the keys of the offense its definitely tough
4030603 every time you catch a punt here someone is right in your face
4030604 i have to adjust to it but im doing pretty good you have to have vision you have to know where your blockers are setting up the biggest thing is you cant mess around back there you have to make your move and get up the field
4030605 the rest of the games are determined during the season but we do know were going to do at least one more penn state game and possibly two
4030606 the two main issues were the level of service and price
4030607 we were able to reach resolution on both we never offered 1 10 per subscriber to comcast that was a number that somehow got out and spread it was never a part of any proposal on our part
4030608 im not surprised that we werent fully distributed at the outset its kind of the way the cable business works but we got the comcast deal done in time for this season and were happy about that
4030609 typically a sports tier is available in about 5 percent of a cable systems homes
4030610 this deal enables us to deliver a preview of the network starting tomorrow over our digital classic level of service
4030611 starting in the spring of 2009 we will have the option to move it into perhaps another level of service if we deem that is in the best interests of our customers
4030612 i get excited about things way too quick if i have a letdown i get pretty angry about it
4030613 i know what it takes to operate as a team
4030614 sasha doesnt even usually have a training partner he usually trains by himself i tried to impart to him that he had to put the team ahead of himself

4030616 he taught me how to take things a little more even stride
4030617 its a dream come true i can imagine having a son being at the olympic games and now to medal
4030618 i did it for him its been our lifelong goal to get a medal at the olympic games
4030619 he hit on the biggest stage anyone could imagine people were doubting him and he nailed it
4030620 i was blown away when i saw the millville tracks
4030621 there are a lot of bmw and porsche clubs that need track time
4030622 njmp also is a tremendous boon to the economy of that area
4030623 we needed mavericks who are passionate about racing to do this
4030624 five years ago it was a dream a year ago we broke ground the community was willing to take the risk because it creates job opportunities and keeps the younger people here
4030625 im just so proud of the wood brothers for giving me a car that i could get out there and give it my best it was great fun running with those guys at the front it would be easy to send me off into the weeds with that rookie stripe on the car
4030626 but as kids we camped everywhere on the citys edge i never saw a bear
4030627 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs
4030628 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us

4030631 there are two sides to todays figures the welcome news is that the numbers on incapacity benefits and lone parent benefit continue to fall as our reforms kick in and more people who were written off before now having the chance to join the high numbers in work the disappointing news is the increase in unemployment but there is considerable help available to people through jobcentre plus there are over 600 000 vacancies available at the moment the majority of people losing one job are into another in less than 3 months despite this months rise in unemployment there are still 380 000 more people in work than a year ago

4030666 we are dedicated to the podcasting industry and want to create tools that help not just personal life media but enable all podcasters to increase their reach and generate new ways to monetize the amazing range of content produced by our community
4030667 i chose the personal life media solution for two reasons first it impressively displays multiple feeds of episodic audio
4030668 secondly because it provides the easiest and most engaging consumer experience with the widest possible sharing reach
4030669 i love that personal life media is making it simple for anyone with multiple shows to pool them together into a widget that can then be placed on any blog or social networking site
4030670 not only can anyone make their own but by allowing simple adjustments such as color and the adding of a custom logo it truly makes it unique to every media producer

4030676 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4030677 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4030678 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4030679 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4030680 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4030681 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4030682 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4030683 if youre coming to a show without some chronic thats a big mistake
4030684 i came out sideways out my moms thing and it started from there they had trouble getting me out so from there its been pretty dumb and pretty stupid
4030685 weve had different drummers but me and kyle are pretty much brothers weve been friends for 29 years so you know jamming with all your best friends and brothers
4030686 oh hell yeah we fight were not going to claim to be perfect super humans
4030687 people fight thats just part of the way the world works like when youre in bed with your girlfriend do you fuck better after you fight or do you fuck better before you fight afterwards the shits more meaningful
4030688 we didnt get signed a lot of people think brad nowell signed us but he just said to his sound guy go record these guys there was no signing it was just an honor for us because the guys in sublime are gods brad was a god
4030689 he had a lot of great stuff he still had in him
4030690 we were huge fans of sublime and it sucked that their career and his life was cut short but their music was timeless for us even that style staying alive is important for music and brad would want it that way it just sucks that hes not around to give us more than he did because the stuff he put out is incredible
4030691 the key to being successful is having to bust your ass on the road when you go out there when you first start nobodys going to be there because nobody is going to know who you are
4030692 but when you play those shows those security guards and bartenders they go and tell their friends and thats kind of how it starts each show gets bigger and bigger but the most important thing is literally hitting up towns over and over again and staying on the road
4030693 whats helped us the most has been our relentless hard work and traveling and not going to college just skipping it and heading onto the road since we were 16 and just playing gigs ever since then the fans i mean weve made a lot of friends over the years at shows and a lot of those friends come back year after year after year
4030694 i think we have some of the most awesome fans there are
4030695 theyre always adamant about pushing slightly stoopid to everybody which is cool because its like having a voice behind the music
4030696 our cd sells fine we sell about 100 000 of each record and thats fine if 100 000 people bought the record three other guys burned it so thats like 300 000 people listening to it as long as the music gets out there the shows get bigger and bigger
4030697 i dont feel ripped off because hes at the show and hes telling his friends yo check out this band its a digital world and people are going to download it anyways you cant get upset because now you have a new fan and hes going to buy one more ticket to the show thats just one more crazy motherfucker at the gig
4030698 honestly i think were outside of what the industry is dealing with weve been independent for so long that everything is working for us
4030699 were not on a label that has to cut back because weve always been independent weve never had a crazy overstock of shit we dont need its all about putting out music the way weve been doing it and i dont see us changing our ways because thats what slightly stoopid is all about
4030700 i dont deal with the politics of the industry i deal with music
4030701 my manager deals with booking shows and i deal with music if theres a complication that i dont agree with we work it out
4030702 i havent met sly amp robbie and im looking forward to it they pretty much invented how reggae is done so its a little weird
4030703 its going to be crazy to go out with them it will definitely be a humbling experience i dont like that were headlining id rather go them

4030729 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4030730 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4030731 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4030732 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4030733 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4030734 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4030735 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4030736 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4030737 his ability to get open and his ability to get downfield have been impressive
4030738 he can create separation and the quarterbacks have a lot of confidence in him which is pretty unusual for a rookie it didnt take long for them to figure out he was getting open
4030739 he is one of the faster ones that i have coached
4030740 there are a couple of things that he has that allows him to be a really fast learner first of all hes a natural player his movements are just natural he does a lot of things that we teach that he just does naturally secondly hes really sharp footballwise really for him it takes him once or twice maybe three reps and hes got it he can take it from the classroom to the field very quickly as well those are all good things weve got a long way to go and hes got a long way to go hes done a nice job up to this point
4030741 i felt like i did a pretty good job for the first nfl game
4030742 watching the film and watching my mistakes theres a lot i can get better on the biggest thing is just looking at film and see the things i have to correct

4030758 sometimes i have so much sex to try to calm myself down i get bored of it and men i sleep with dont seem to make as much effort because i climax so easily
4030759 within a few weeks i just began to get more and more aroused more and more of the time and i just kept having endless orgasms it started off in bed where sex sessions would last for hours and my boyfriend would be stunned at how many times i would orgasm then it would happen after sex id be thinking about what wed done in bed and id start feeling a bit flushed then id become aroused and climax in six months i was having 150 orgasms a day and it has been as many as 200
4030760 often ill want to wear myself out by having as many orgasms as i can so they stop and i can get some peace

4030769 character and his toy forms now represents the more accurate horizontal posturing and as a

4030771 grimlocks lower jaw is very distorted and far larger than the rest of his head
4030772 style but there are still techy details on his chest underneath a clear abs cover with another printed silver autobot logo
4030773 counterpart which strikes me as very odd his legs are always spaced apart a ways due to how he transforms

4030775 entered theaters on july 3rd and became a blockbuster scores of fans were clamoring for a copy of the original musical score by however wb records said in an official statement that the score would not be released for the foreseeable future in protest a fan supported
4030776 was released in october that same year containing just shy of one hour of the original score jablonsky also personally wrote to the creators of the petition thanking them for their efforts the cd would go on to become the 32nd best selling soundtrack on amazon com at the time of its release
4030777 with the potential for additional original tracks to be added
4030778 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4030779 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
4030780 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4030781 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern painted on the floor which we think showed respect to the chinese
4030782 but they are not they dont know who is the president of georgia i am sure
4030783 the last 2 years from midseason on reggie has played very well reggie and i have discussed that and we are doing as a team and individuals everything possible to get him off to a faster start
4030784 i feel like i already got off to a good start in workouts
4030785 im feeling some positive vibes out here about what im doing my routes are good consistency catching the ball im feeling confident about my game as long as it tranfers to the season and to the games everything is going to be all right
4030786 thats great more receivers to go out there and make plays and help the team thats awesome you want that the more the merrier
4030787 i dont want to look ahead i want to stay right here right now every day one practice at a time as long as i do that and dont get ahead of myself then everything works out
4030788 mistakes you made mistakes you might make i need to stay right here right now thatll help me progress as a receiver
4030789 had a tendency to work on my strengths a little bit more than i have my weaknesses ive tried to reverse that this year
4030790 so wherever i went i would be able to get catches in and keep my eyes focused its helped me tremendously during this training camp because im so much more focused
4030791 i have him plugged in there to do that if i think that leg is getting fatigued or if he is giving an indicator that it is then well get him out of there i dont want to take any steps back there
4030792 i think he has handled the last few days very well but im not na ve to the problem either
4030793 i want to make sure everything is set up for him so that he has a foundation there that he can bank on
4030794 i would not say we are not pleased but where i would say we are not praising as much concerns the issue of spectators at some of the venues
4030795 you can take it as not being happy because i like to be performing at 100 percent i would like to have always all the stadiums full but if i compare it to past games i can be pleased because we are not the worst and we are even better in some of the events
4030796 at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
4030797 yes its true that we got questions from the sponsors and that they would like to see more people going to the showcases
4030798 we expected a jammed ballpark especially behind home plate you play a lot of international games in that fashion
4030799 when they came up with computer scoring it really did not help us
4030800 most of our trainers are professional people who train their kids in a professional style that style does not do well internationally
4030801 when you have an argument with him doesnt he call people and tell them i hate him the difference is that these guys have access to the press and so when they say i hate him everybodys hearing it
4030802 everythings good hes a good guy were going to get through this not just me but our whole team
4030803 i might catch some flak for saying this but you know theyre front runners when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
4030804 i was blown away when i saw the millville tracks
4030805 there are a lot of bmw and porsche clubs that need track time
4030806 njmp also is a tremendous boon to the economy of that area
4030807 we needed mavericks who are passionate about racing to do this
4030808 five years ago it was a dream a year ago we broke ground the community was willing to take the risk because it creates job opportunities and keeps the younger people here
4030809 im just so proud of the wood brothers for giving me a car that i could get out there and give it my best it was great fun running with those guys at the front it would be easy to send me off into the weeds with that rookie stripe on the car
4030810 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4030811 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4030812 i was blown away when i saw the millville tracks
4030813 there are a lot of bmw and porsche clubs that need track time
4030814 njmp also is a tremendous boon to the economy of that area
4030815 we needed mavericks who are passionate about racing to do this
4030816 five years ago it was a dream a year ago we broke ground the community was willing to take the risk because it creates job opportunities and keeps the younger people here
4030817 im just so proud of the wood brothers for giving me a car that i could get out there and give it my best it was great fun running with those guys at the front it would be easy to send me off into the weeds with that rookie stripe on the car
4030818 you dont get many chances in life to do something special like this and im going to look back at very fondly the whole weekend to be honest with you
4030819 the old concept that owner of a biusiness had the right to use his property as pleased to maximize profits
4030820 more than 30 years ago paul allen and i started microsoft because we wanted to be part of a movement to put a computer on every desk and in every home
4030821 pick an ugly one no one wants anymore a clearance rack molecule
4030822 what we need is stuff installed and what we need is people to make sure its going to work and what we need is for the umpires to understand the protocol what we need is to make sure that everyone whos participating understands it
4030823 they fought with true american spirit on paper it looked like the other countries were stronger than us many people didnt believe after qualifiers they would be on the podium
4030824 i definitely was calculating everything in my head after the hamm brothers came off the team
4030825 but i didnt recalculate it and put myself in the situation i knew raj should have been on the team to begin with and i knew sasha would help them on the pommel horse
4030826 ive learned a lot about my body how to develop it to the level i need to
4030827 i was no help to my team going out there and being of no help trying to be a hero instead of saying you know what i cant do it its a stupid thing on my part if you cant do it you cant do it
4030828 but at the same time if hes hurting hes hurting if his back is bothering him he cant play
4030829 but at the same time i dont expect it to happen anymore
4030830 can we get it done i dont know because were not getting it done your performance speaks for itself its not like theyre not trying or anything like that weve got some weak spots can we get it done so far were having a hard time proving that
4030831 this is my first olympic medal i have nine world medals ill always remember this moment
4030832 a gold medal would have been a little better yeah but im walking away from this competition knowing that i have an olympic medal is a huge accomplishment my goal coming in was to have no regrets at the end of the day who knows this might be a once in a lifetime opportunity
4030833 when it comes down to the all around me and nastia are more than happy to go out there and represent the usa again
4030834 the whole time weve been here team has been really important but after getting this over with all around is next
4030835 we needed to have an offensive night like this that is huge for us
4030836 more than anything he is learning learning the pitchers and learning what to do in the clubhouse i know it has been a good experience for him we cant expect him to do anything more
4030837 the bullpen has been getting up and down a lot
4030838 it made sense to take me out but i would have liked to go one more inning
4030839 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4030840 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4030841 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4030842 unbelievable a good deal for the sixers if they win
4030843 luckily there are incentive clauses i guess 80 million wasnt enough thank goodness there are incentives
4030844 in times like these it all sounds like monopoly money but this is the market its not out of line from either side this is a case where both sides won you cant say iguodala lost and the sixers know what theyre doing ed stefanski has done a pretty good job of turning this around hes a very straight shooter the sixers know what iguodala meant to the franchise
4030845 im a little shocked but this is a lot of money but iguodala made out by gambling i didnt think hed get that much hes a good player and hed be in the rotation of all the teams but there are teams he wouldnt start for to me its a lot for a guy who hasnt been an all star who hasnt been out of the first round of the playoffs
4030846 if anyone can transcend the limited shelf life of olympians its phelps
4030847 como hemos conocido toda la vida a plut n como planeta resulta que le hemos cogido tanto cari o que queremos que retorne a ser de nuevo planeta sin embargo como eris es un recien llegado un extra o apenas conocido pues como que a ese nos da igual
4030848 hes the greatest olympian in the world and hell be able to earn money everywhere as hes an international brand
4030849 hes a billion dollar man he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4030850 see if any other champions emerge to defend the mortal world
4030851 this time last year you couldnt keep a lid on it at all
4030852 the town was in a frenzy that anxiety anticipation and the nerves of going into another finals series
4030853 are they going to lose again all those sorts of things
4030854 this year its been pretty calm theres a definite level of expectation amongst our supporters and theyre expecting the best
4030855 but not so much the frenzy there was last year more a gradual buildup
4030856 it could be a preview for a qualifying final in a months time
4030857 its a showpiece game for the afl and we wont be taking our foot off the accelerator at all
4030858 we are on a hot streak and youve got to cash your cheques when theyre due
4030859 this year and in footy in general there doesnt seem to be those one on one matchups there used to be in the past
4030860 its very much a rotation thing and goodesy is certainly one of those players who could be rotated through because hes a threat and theres plenty of homework to be done on him
4030861 it was one of the most memorable games ive ever played in

4030869 we outplayed them for two innings and they outplayed us for seven
4030870 its one of those games you just really have to battle though
4030871 there was a 2 minute delay so the world feed could get alicias routine into the world feed
4030872 that was unfortunate but it is not unusual the hold could have had an effect on alicia
4030873 i have no way to know it possibly could be possibly not
4030874 i told her alicia they tried to break your focus you let them do that never let them do that we work on that
4030875 in my opinion it was an attempt to break concentration thats exactly what happened
4030876 unfortunately she is the type of gymnast who is very emotional
4030877 the rest of the games are determined during the season but we do know were going to do at least one more penn state game and possibly two
4030878 the two main issues were the level of service and price
4030879 we were able to reach resolution on both we never offered 1 10 per subscriber to comcast that was a number that somehow got out and spread it was never a part of any proposal on our part
4030880 im not surprised that we werent fully distributed at the outset its kind of the way the cable business works but we got the comcast deal done in time for this season and were happy about that
4030881 typically a sports tier is available in about 5 percent of a cable systems homes
4030882 this deal enables us to deliver a preview of the network starting tomorrow over our digital classic level of service
4030883 starting in the spring of 2009 we will have the option to move it into perhaps another level of service if we deem that is in the best interests of our customers
4030884 germany has more companies working in our area of expertise than any other european country and we are delighted to offer this facility this office will place us in the ideal location to provide the best service to our clients also in the local language and to continue to help and advise the industry in these inspiring and exciting times
4030885 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term ferry said
4030886 he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
4030887 gang of 10 a group of five democrats and five republicans in the senate is
4030888 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise
4030889 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day
4030890 im not getting into that off limits not talking good try but i saw it coming
4030891 i will be putting pen to paper at some point yes
4030892 they will be an attempt to put in a longer term historical perspective the events of more than 33 years of public life
4030893 i will at some time have something to say in more details about the achievements of my government and things more generally
4030894 in the end all of us in public life will be judged by history and im no different from anybody else
4030895 i have a very lovely psychiatrist who works with me in my offices and his christian background is that he tries to help homosexuals trying to turn away from what they are engaged in i am happy to put any homosexual in touch with this gentleman and i have met people who have turned around to become heterosexual
4030896 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing innocent children
4030897 because im intimidating and or weird thats what i hear
4030898 its the first bright news for traders in the oil market in a while
4030899 the dramatic drop off in commodities and specifically oil has been well overdone in my view
4030900 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4030901 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4030902 last years contract negotiations were messy because of perhaps the people who were involved because of what was or what wasnt written in the contract and needed to be done at a certain date and was allowed to roll on
4030903 ive spoken to eugene arocca and ive spoken to james brayshaw this week and im sure that things will or wont get sorted out but my main concern is winning games of footy right now
4030904 i just think it is important for everyone at the footy club to focus on what were doing now
4030905 if we can complete our task against carlton this weekend we play in a finals series
4030906 im sure if you asked 15 other clubs they would have an interest in jess smith
4030907 what i was staggered about was the article said he was uncontracted which is completely untrue
4030908 he is contracted until the next year hes not going anywhere
4030909 theyre a completely different side to anything that weve come up against in the previous carlton sides
4030910 he comes to play hard he come up with big hits
4030911 i dont pay attention to it ive been on waivers plenty of times
4030912 cest moins dramatique que ne le laissaient redouter les derni res rumeurs
4030913 des d penses de consommation des m nages en recul et des investissements plus faibles
4030914 nous avions pr vu laffaiblissement de la croissance au deuxi me trimestre

4030930 cest un chiffre qui nest pas bon il ne faut pas se voiler la face
4030931 mais je pense que nous avons un nombre de r formes qui vont entrer en vigueur maintenant qui vont nous mettre dans le bon sens
4030932 lisa is a phenomenal success story but her story is mirrored by many other successful men and women who are carving out brilliant full and part time careers at dominos pizza
4030933 their combined efforts are helping to change perceptions of jobs in the industry
4030934 adresses choisies pour des amis qui ne le sont pas moins
4030935 adresses pour clouer le bec de ceux qui en connaissent trop
4030936 its just a letter on why i feel i should be reinstated its my chance to respond and well see how it goes
4030937 so i think the letter is real important in terms of influencing the commissioners decision
4030938 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4030939 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4030940 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4030941 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4030942 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4030943 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4030944 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4030945 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4030946 relative wages in those industries are rising relative to others and that helps the labour resources flow mr stevens told a parliamentary committee at the time
4030947 that is what is supposed to happen in a shock of this nature
4030948 while it is not without a few bumps on the road this adjustment is not proceeding too badly he said
4030949 never increase beyond what is necessary the number of entities required to explain anything

4030955 you never know they might mess around and never make the final
4030956 last year everybody had me paste for a bronze medal
4030957 and i came in there and i did what i had to do and i got the silver
4030958 la france sera en pr vision sur le trimestre 2 moins 0 3 donc un peu mieux que lallemagne et au m me niveau que litalie cest un ph nom ne qui est europ en et qui est mondial
4030959 tous les pays d velopp s sont affect s par ces ralentissements conomiques
4030960 ce sont des chiffres auxquels on sattendait et qui ne sont pas bons
4030961 cest un choc conomique en retour de la crise financi re de l t dernier qui a amen une augmentation tr s significative du prix des mati res premi res et en particulier du p trole
4030962 a entra n une r surgence de l qui a atteint son pic en juin juillet et on devrait avoir math matiquement une diminution de linflation dans les mois qui viennent
4030963 les circonstances conomiques devraient cr er les conditions dun rebond la fin de lann e 2008 d but 2009 seront plus favorables
4030964 la r cession ce sont deux trimestres cons cutifs n gatifs l il nest pas question de parler de r cession
4030965 ce serait techniquement inexact l on a un trimestre n gatif ndlr toute personne qui crierait au loup et la r cession aurait un trimestre davance
4030966 mis en place certain nombre de r forme qui vont commencer entrer en vigueur maintenant qui devraient nous mettre dans le bon sens
4030967 on a enclench une politique de fond pour se d tacher de la contrainte p troli re
4030968 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4030969 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4030970 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4030971 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot
4030972 around two dozen convicts affiliated with various political and criminal armed outfits in southern nepal have fled
4030973 weve caught five of them the rest of the fugitives are still at large and we have intensified our search
4030974 there are a lot more of us plus sized ladies modeling today compared to twenty or even ten years ago
4030975 hey joe can speak for himself im proud to have his support but i dont tell him what he can or cannot say or put words in his mouth if youve got a problem with something joe said take it up with him
4030976 ill look back at it and think of how much fun it was
4030977 it was his moment and it was tough for me to fully enjoy it because i wanted to see him win too everybody in the stadium wanted to see him win
4030978 at the same time i wouldnt have gone in it if i didnt want to win
4030979 it does feel good im definitely proud of the fact that i have that trophy to keep and all that kind of stuff
4030980 i didnt make up the rules i just kind of went along with it i was fortunate we got to start over
4030981 it was kind of funny it happens a lot people call me jason all the time
4030982 we did get the better side of the draw no doubt about it
4030983 when you watch it in the morning you feel sorry for the guys but theres times when you say well ive been there before ive been on that side of the draw too youve got to take it it all balances out and you have to take advantage of it
4030984 starting the day i would have definitely taken a 1 over par given the weather we had when we started
4030985 it was just tough to keep dry and the wind was as strong as ive ever seen
4030986 you got rain blowing sideways it was cold it was windy
4030987 it was difficult keeping my hands dry and of course i wear glasses so that didnt help its a brutal golf course
4030988 if i had continued i dont think i would have broken 90
4030989 it got to the point where you just dont care
4030990 what a way to honour mr ackles fighting to the end and pulling it out in the end
4030991 it was a great win because we struggled so much on offence our defence held us in there
4030992 both of us expected that it would come out earlier but he has such a big arm he put it out there and johnson got tripped up
4030993 it wasnt so much what they were doing we were kind of stopping ourselves
4030994 korey is a guy thats just coming into his own
4030995 we know bob we know his family and we miss him but we had to win for him
4030996 you dont want to leave it in the hands of the officials
4030997 theyve got to keep throwing the ball theyve just got to make some plays near the end of the game
4030998 i came out here with a plan and i did execute that well
4030999 my coach no doubt will tell me what i did wrong i just came here to work on my 200 and i did just that today
4031000 im still not sure about beijing im still waiting to see whats going on
4031001 id definitely like to double i think i could do well in both
4031002 im just looking for consistency and to do what my coach says
4031003 with that throw and my long jump yesterday it has been an encouraging weekend
4031004 you come in here and hope to do well and then you end up scoring the winning run the derby was pretty special definitely a couple of days ill always remember
4031005 we were told the game would find a way to finish itself
4031006 thats the longest 4 1 2 seconds of my life
4031007 im probably giving myself credit it was probably more like 5 1 2 seconds
4031008 it was dragging on we wanted to win it they wanted to win it guys are getting mad when theyre making outs usually you dont see too many guys snapping at an all star game
4031009 it had to be like that so dramatic like this
4031010 a lot of guys a lot history and they make baseball what it is
4031011 to be able to stand on the same field as those guys is obviously a tremendous honour it was kind of like a kid in a candy store where i think youre in awe more than anything its pretty special
4031012 theres always so much buildup all during the leadup you anticipate it and it seems like its over before you know it
4031013 when you go out there you know its going to be quick so you enjoy it i had a lot of fun
4031014 weve got a lot of players here making their stamp on stampeder history
4031015 i wish jesse a speedy recovery and i definitely would have like to see him come because you want to compete against the best
4031016 ive broke records in college and im climbing up the record chart here but ive never won a championship
4031017 if i want to go somewhere and get 2 000 yards thats fine and dandy but thats not what i want i want to win grey cups
4031018 he was a runaway train sometimes and that was good to see
4031019 the more often we can see that type of play the better we will be offensively
4031020 we had a challenge this week and did not respond
4031021 when you only get 10 touchdowns in two years and you have three in the first four games thats pretty big for me
4031022 id just dot him right in the back with a fastball and see if hes got enough guts to come out to the mound
4031023 when the rosters got announced i texted russ and demps and told them it was pretty exciting
4031024 i didnt know how many guys had made it before and bay could have made it another guy
4031025 the record is pretty cool thats something that definitely were proud of
4031026 going through injury having tommy john surgery and coming back from that closing then back starting and just going through everything this year its been a fun journey
4031027 hopefully now i can keep it going and just be as consistent as possible
4031028 when i went that year 2000 i thought id go the next year and the next year thats how you feel you feel confident in yourself and your ability it didnt work out that way
4031029 you cant control injuries all you can control is rehab and trying to come back as strong as possible
4031030 im just glad to get back to where i was before hopefully a bit better
4031031 you want to be playing well enough at the break to be named an all star you want to be there with the best players in the game
4031032 sitting in a room with derek jeter alex rodriguez mariano rivera david ortiz guys that everybody knows is an honour its pretty cool to think of
4031033 theres always certain things you can get better at a lot of guys here are probably perfectionists they want to keep getting better and thats a reason why youre good you dont really accept staying the same thats my main thing
4031034 calling a game defence blocking learning how to get a better step an extra jump i want to steal bases theres so much about the game of baseball that youre never going to stop learning i just want to make sure im not letting anything go by
4031035 there arent a lot of us in the big leagues from canada and to have three of us go to the all star game is good for the young guys of canada that grow up playing baseball that theres not only a chance to make it to pro ball but also to make it to the big leagues and to be an all star print
4031036 they hit balls hard right at people i was fortunate to get through that
4031037 i wasnt locating my fastball today and i didnt in baltimore on tuesday either its tough to pitch when you cant throw that over for a strike and they can sit on everything else
4031038 when you make mistakes it doesnt matter what team youre playing in the big leagues theyre going to beat you
4031039 ive got to work on it and locate like i did before the all star break
4031040 if i locate my fastball then everything else falls into place i dont know what it is right now ive just got to figure it out whether its something mechanical or not
4031041 the way it was going the third the fourth inning you started feeling that it was going to be a low scoring ballgame
4031042 it turned out to be 5 1 thats not a lot of runs but we obviously have got to give him more support than that
4031043 scutaro didnt have his hand in there it was just a mistake he made
4031044 its going to happen we thought it was a double play im pretty sure he thought he was going to get a double play too it just didnt work out
4031045 its been on my mind but its nice to get out there and be able to forget about it for a while
4031046 but if we take two out of three the rest of the way ill be real happy too
4031047 kind of nervous to meet the guys on the mound
4031048 probably should have been in the bullpen but i didnt care
4031049 the pre game ceremony was amazing i wanted to be a part of it because i thought it was unbelievable they got everybody together and i wanted to be a part of it
4031050 the one guy i read a lot about but didnt get to meet whitey ford
4031051 a lot of guys a lot of history being able to be on he field with those guys is an honour
4031052 i didnt do half the things they said i did
4031053 they said i was always knocking guys down and hitting guys but i won a game or two in there
4031054 i had good stuff that day i threw that overhand high fastball out of the bleachers we figured the national league hitters hadnt seen it
4031055 you cant shuck n jive the people in this city
4031056 im done writing my speech its about 10 minutes long i hope i make it through
4031057 tony gwynn told me dont look at anyone in your family or you might not make it
4031058 the year hes having and for him to come in and put on a show like that it was something impressive we were in awe of what he was doing
4031059 at the same time this is something ive always dreamed of
4031060 i said after the first round if i dont hit another ball out or if i dont win this im not going to be disappointed
4031061 human nature you are a little disappointed but we accomplished what we wanted to
4031062 probably never really got a lot of thank yous for doing it either
4031063 we were sitting there saying how do you follow that
4031064 berkman went out there and he was blasting balls in the upper deck and it almost seemed like everyone was bored
4031065 guys were messing with me from my team michael young said i want to see you hit the bank of america sign i said ok ill try and i came out doing it
4031066 that last round youre out there swinging youre tired and you try to create the power instead of like the first round just letting it happen nice and easy
4031067 he said no but i might have a heart attack
4031068 its a fun event if you start swinging well if you get hot its a little tough if youre not swinging that well
4031069 as long as you get that first one you can kind of relax after that you get one then all of a sudden you start going you feel good
4031070 i hold the prime minister personally responsible for the damage that is about to be done to the nation and to the integrity and dignity of the malays
4031071 what a great tribute to our players that they battle and they find a way to win
4031072 we want to win every game regardless of who the opponent is
4031073 it was a little tough but i was fine and ready to go
4031074 you just have to try and take their momentum away i appreciate what they did for me but i just wanted to play football
4031075 at some point were going to hit the critical mass here ive been talking about
4031076 he executed the plays we gave him extremely well some of you have been saying to me the last few weeks that we have two quarterbacks who can win and i say no we have three
4031077 i think the third quarter with my touchdown and the way it ended was the turning point
4031078 it was good to get us up and make our defence breathe a little easier
4031079 joseph put up 20 some points and that should be enough for us to win most days
4031080 we just didnt play well enough on the other side of the ball
4031081 we had a chance today but once again its the same old thing thats been going on here all year guys on third base and we cant get them in with less than two outs
4031082 we should have won that game at least 4 3 thats one of the things were still working on and keep talking to guys to see what theyre thinking when theyre up there in that situation because whatever it is its not too good
4031083 im happy that im 28 doing this instead of 22 just because i can keep it under control a bit more ive been through a lot of hard roads and now that its all paid off its no time to be nervous just time to do what youve grown up doing
4031084 if richmond pitches like that all the time it certainly gives us a chance to win the ballgame
4031085 i liked the way he handled himself out there he did a good job as far as im concerned he deserves another start
4031086 because we had plenty of opportunities to get richmond the win
4031087 if we plan on doing something like getting to the playoffs or a playoff run we cant have these games you get three or four chances to score runs with a runner on third and less than two outs you cant let them get out of that
4031088 tiens a serait sympa de faire une grosse perf ici

4031091 i cant get enough of chuck lewis aka poetic prophet
4031092 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4031093 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4031094 i think mccain has to have a running mate that clearly connects with social conservatives in the party
4031095 that is where he is lacking so if he picks a pro choice running mate i dont see how he can win this race
4031096 im not going to say people will stay home but there is a core of voters whose level of enthusiasm influences people further from the core
4031097 so if mccain picks a pro choice running mate the strength of turnout on election day is not going to be there for him

4031103 to go 109 yards in about a minute is big
4031104 it just shows what we can get done when we all collectively come together we cant have one guy making a mistake and the other 11 doing it right we need to have all 12 being on the same page
4031105 i told kerry to put the team on his shoulders and he did
4031106 i thought he did a damn good job and called his own number when he had to
4031107 we have to let kerry joseph play we cant harness him and he played the game like its meant to be played
4031108 our receivers and running backs played well but kerry was the key
4031109 when you have a quarterback who can run it opens a lot in the passing game this is doing it the hard way but we know if we get in that situation again we can perform
4031110 it was a special day for me and i knew he would want me to go out and have fun
4031111 i told my mother this morning i was going to go out and enjoy it and let it all hang out and see what happens it was a great win when we put forth a total effort as a team this is what we can do but we can get better
4031112 we couldnt make plays when we had to make plays
4031113 weve got them pinned on the one yard line but we couldnt stop them there were times offensively when we turned the ball over in the red zone where we gave precious points away
4031114 early in final drive we played a lot of zone and were giving it up
4031115 then the last one that scott caught a 22 yard reception that put toronto on edmontons 13 yard line was all my fault weve got a young team im not using that as an excuse weve just got to learn to put these games away
4031116 when he knew he was going to be tested he went off and it is the escort who caught him up
4031117 he found himself blocked off there was a traffic jam of cars and he could not get through the cars
4031118 we asked him to apologize to the agency and the staff which he did along with his team director
4031119 we told him that because of his behaviour we were now going to test him after each stage he put a target on himself
4031120 ill call her betty who lives in south carolina just because its my first start and thats always big
4031121 its not like we needed a touchdown there but if i could just get the chains down there into field goal range then we would win because we have an excellent kicker
4031122 all i know jykine bradley absolutely busted his butt running all the way down the field chasing the guy knocked the ball out clearly on the one one and a half yard line and you get one guy signalling a touchdown i dont know if that affected our guys continuing to chase the ball but the ball was knocked out on the one yard line thats a fumble
4031123 if they want to come watch i try to put on a show for everybody whether its scouts or fans or my own teammates like i said before im wearing a blue jay on my on my chest and on my hat until im told otherwise
4031124 but lets just say im glad ending the first half on a good note its a big positive for me and this team
4031125 you could see it in his eyes from the first pitch that he was going to have a good day
4031126 it was right on time for us too because i was certainly worried about his pitch count but he did a good job with that throwing just 98 pitches
4031127 it doesnt happen often but it happens once in a while
4031128 we had a goal of 500 but i think this is pretty good for us
4031129 were on a roll were pitching pretty good swinging the bats and its kind of a shame that the break did come now because youd like to keep going out and keep playing and have this stretch last as long as possible
4031130 we need to come back with the same mentality and try to keep doing what were doing right now
4031131 if we want to make the plalyoffs weve got to be better
4031132 we stink right now for the most part as a team weve kind of stunk it up here lately and weve got to play better
4031133 more people know me now and the players respect me more because of where im ranked
4031134 its great for younger athletes who can look up to see a canadian girl in the top 50 and use me as an example
4031135 its a great opportunity for me to meet jankovic again
4031136 it would be great match but first i have to win my first one and thats all im focusing on now
4031137 yung jan is very aggressive she hits hard ill have to be very focused and play offensive and smart
4031138 unfortunately i lost in l a but it was my ninth match in 11 days so it was very tough
4031139 and now i can recover and get ready for this
4031140 i fell in training on the day of the match
4031141 it swelled up and took two or three days to go down it was hard to walk and to take the plane because it hurt but its better now i can train as usual
4031142 around 20 riders have results a little high right on the limit
4031143 there are no infractions but some figures are very close to the limit particularly as regards the level of hematocrit
4031144 the court of arbitration of sport affirmed its jurisdiction to decide the appeals
4031145 such procedure of mutual legal assistance can take several months
4031146 that was 1997 this is huge and its very emotional nobody gave us a chance and were ok with that we loved being the underdogs last year and look how that turned out
4031147 we got the win and it was tough but games like this help you build character and shows you where you are at as a team we came out on top and thats the most important thing
4031148 were a good team i put a lot of blame on myself for those turnover that i had in crucial situations that gave montreal the short field and they scored both times thats 14 points off of turnovers and they definitely hurt us and made it a much closer ball game than it should have been
4031149 its always frustrating when you lose you have to take care of the ball you cant let interceptions happen you cant let fumbles happen that was the difference in the game today
4031150 i think we have a hell of a team right now
4031151 it looks like were pretty much running on all cylinders we take a little while to get started but once we get started its hard stopping us
4031152 it was very physical game on both sides of the ball
4031153 we did a number of things to put ourselves in position to win and we also put ourselves into a position where you saw the final result
4031154 it was one of those days where you could relax a little bit
4031155 we had a couple guys get some big hits and thats what we have to do win rios had a great day scutaro got us going
4031156 we did not pitch like we normally do today and thats why they beat us
4031157 i dont have a bunch but when i get one theyre good
4031158 its a game of mistakes and today they made me pay
4031159 it was one of those days where it wasnt my day
4031160 my mechanics were a little bit off im still able to throw my fastball where i wanted it i needed to see some hitters in a live situation and now i feel confident that i can go out there and do what i need to do
4031161 what i did during the tour is done i made a mistake and the mistake is only mine
4031162 i have always won with my own legs unfortunately ive made a mistake and i will pay for it
4031163 for now im not even thinking of going back on a bike im here because i had a huge burden and i wanted to get rid of it
4031164 its something that im definitely going to reflect on now and then when im done
4031165 i continue to stay healthy and im surrounded by good talent and good things are going to come from that so as long as i can stay healthy and these guys do their job around me were going to do some special things here in montreal
4031166 it was a huge play obviously to be able to start fast but to my recollection the last three games i think weve started fast in the third quarter
4031167 i just wanted them to forget about the first half and move on like it didnt happen the game was 0 0 and just go play and they handled it very well and they finished the game
4031168 richie did what he can do we had too many penalties i dont know what the total was but weve been doing good the last time we lost the penalty ratio was the first game against montreal and the rest of the games weve been plus
4031169 any game you can come in and go 5 for 5 its definitely a good feeling especially two of them being 50 and 51
4031170 i mightve got it up if he wasnt there simply driver error
4031171 weve had a big string of bad luck the past couple of races i was just trying to settle into the race and was running outside the no 26 car and he lost it and collected me its really unfortunate
4031172 my radio wasnt connected right and i couldnt hear the team for a while then i was able to run pretty well through the traffic after fixing the radio
4031173 its very tough to come from behind here i had to drive through all of the gt cars the p1 cars are very hard to pass too because of their straightaway speed
4031174 if it is our last time were here obviously im not going to like it because weve won here the last three years in a row i think its a fantastic track
4031175 i think what ive learned over the years is that drivers have absolutely no power
4031176 obviously this place is great you see folks out there if the series sees the best interest in not coming back theres nothing we can do certainly the drivers like to be here
4031177 will was off the pace for about 20 laps before that but he had gathered it back up and was going again then for some reason he slowed way down in the middle of turns 3 and 4
4031178 i had two choices get on the brakes hard and risk losing the rear of the car and spinning out or go to the high side and see if there was any grip up there to let me get around him
4031179 i feel bad for the guys because now its back to the shop to fix a race car before we go to mid ohio next week to go from the high of last week to the low of tonight is tough on all of us
4031180 i mean how often in a lifetime are you ever able to wave the green flag for a major event to be able to do this again and give back to united way its the best of both worlds
4031181 it was extremely inspirational to have him here before the game so soon after the surgery we played really hard tonight it wasnt always easy but we found a way to win it good football teams find a way to win
4031182 this year we are winning some of the close games
4031183 i think it just shows the leadership we have on the football team and the belief we have in one another we are a better football team bottom line we dont beat ourselves and in years past we probably have a little bit when you have all three phases of the game playing well you are probably going to come out on top
4031184 offensively we got away a little bit from what worked for us in the first half
4031185 we just werent making the plays we should have made we had drives that were going and then we had dropped balls or bobbled snaps what could go wrong went wrong for us in the second half
4031186 every time he touches the ball he can make something special happen
4031187 today he touched it several different ways he was really good for us im stating the obvious but i think he is a pretty good football player
4031188 after two big plays like that i had some trouble getting my wind back they gave me oxygen but i was so tired that didnt even help me
4031189 the guys were saying to me all week that it was time to get a big time return and they gave me some great blocks and it was off to the races it was pretty exciting
4031190 we gave up two returns for touchdowns and we gave up two interceptions that turned into touchdowns when that happens a game gets away from you real quick
4031191 what impressed me the most was that we were up by two when the fourth quarter started and normally we would have started panicking in those situations in the past
4031192 this time really took it to them im proud of our guys

4031205 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
4031206 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
4031207 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
4031208 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
4031209 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
4031210 there is no cease fire russian forces are moving around
4031211 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
4031212 any attempt by him to dislodge the government using his authority under article 58 2b of the constitution will plunge the country into yet another election the results of which are unlikely to differ greatly from the february 18 poll he can also reach out to his hand picked supreme court to halt the impeachment process on technical grounds but given the prevailing public opinion the supreme court will be hesitant to oblige him
4031213 they were often personal outpourings some were written as poetry and some cast him as one of his own poetic characters
4031214 some writers even sent him their own work while others spoke of their own circumstances and how they felt much better for writing to byron
4031215 can you burn this letter as soon as you have read it
4031216 the fact that he kept them suggests he really did care what people thought and although he struck a pose of aloofness he appears to have treasured these letters
4031217 i suppose in my life i have received at least 200 anonymous letters aye 300 of love literature advice abuse menace or consolation upon all topics and in every shape
4031218 i actually feel like i lost the game we were very lucky and we did not play how you are supposed to play against a team with just ten men especially if they have to play for ten after just three minutes
4031219 football is meant to be played by 11 players not just by one the players have to get their heads down and play according to instructions
4031220 this victory is important for me and georgia i would like to dedicate this medal to the people of georgia
4031221 i proved the existence of georgia in the world with my gold
4031222 it means very much for our country because of the conflict thank you to my country thank you to my people
4031223 before we started we got messages of support from georgia i felt that the whole country was cheering for us
4031224 two days ago everyone went berserk in the olympic village some georgian athletes were crying over the possibility of being pulled out of the olympic games some very good judokas could not compete because their families are back in georgia
4031225 if i had had my family there in georgia i would not have been in a fit state to compete
4031226 the competition was a victory for sport because sport stands for friendship we have had so many big wars in the 20th century what we need is peace that is something politics can learn from sport
4031227 i have won many friends through sport not only in russia but in many other countries we are friends

4031230 la expulsi n fue error m o porque hay un reglamento que es de fifa entonces yo pienso que la federaci n mexicana tiene todo el derecho de escribir su carta a santa claus que es el se or presidente de fifa joseph blatter y decir se or blatter estamos llevando al 100 por ciento su reglamento
4031231 aquel entrenador como el tuca que hace tonter as est siendo expulsado y le cobramos veintitantos mil pesos y es cierto l stima que es nada m s cuando le conviene
4031232 esta regla viene de fifa estamos de acuerdo la regla de que un jugador cuando termine su contrato con un equipo es libre tambi n viene de fifa y por qu la federaci n mexicana no la lleva a cabo
4031233 entonces la cartita a santa claus blatter tambi n debe llevar postdata la otra regla que usted me dice que lleve a cabo no la estoy llevando a cabo porque no me conviene la de expulsar a los entrenadores y cobrarles veinte mil pesos s me conviene necesitamos una lanita para remodelar las instalaciones y las vamos a seguir est bien va a ser la nica cooperacha que voy a hacer

4031237 precios arriba de 80 d lares es la nueva realidad
4031238 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
4031239 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
4031240 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
4031241 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
4031242 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it
4031243 i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tire halted my progress
4031244 i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
4031245 when i saw the car on fire on the straight the smoke i thought it could be felipe but couldnt believe it
4031246 i just tried not to do any mistakes and stay in front of him
4031247 i didnt expect the podium its just the perfect weekend
4031248 it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor
4031249 here let me give you the number for jenny craig

4031251 holy mackerel i have never heard this before i think you may have just unlocked the door to weightloss for all mankind

4031254 the difference between a weed and a flower is a judgement
4031255 from the same topsoil the weed grows and the flower
4031256 one day i was for the first time at the window to eternity
4031257 it was completely unclear to me why i had to visit a window to eternity eternity it is said so fast then but are we prepared for eternity everybody will then imagine a different picture i of course too
4031258 i visualized eternity as an infinitely large room flooded with light a hot spot
4031259 i saw nothing felt nothing and fumbled while i groped forward everything withdrew and i felt nothing while i listened no noise could be heard and if i did not listen it seemed to swoosh no matter what i tried i did not come to a coherent perception
4031260 i threw a look inside and was immediately moved to tears
4031261 let them go it is your desire to see them try to imagine the place here
4031262 i let my parents go and noticed how an environment emerged a blue world in which everything seemed soaked with knowledge no matter where i looked i knew the importance of what i saw for example i saw an unreal angel shape and knew immediately that there was no angel but a wandering awareness from somewhere else of the planet wandering through eternity i was looking for my teacher and i felt her enlightenment felt that she herself had sought and had not yet finished her way
4031263 wait we will talk about it when it is time
4031264 in other words men compete with each other for superiority and influence with the mean of the physical characteristics of women
4031265 and so it may happen that a woman sees a man with the heart and failed to see the truth because they were not looking out for seduction deception to increase the attractiveness of the male ego
4031266 that a women chooses her own man is certainly not uncommon
4031267 there is a difference with women who find themselves in a relationship because they shall support the ego of a man
4031268 children of single mothers have it harder in life and in this way can the love of children very quickly become a real replacement for the former fake love of the man

4031271 we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic but our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this manna before our eyes
4031272 then moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly moses also was displeased
4031273 if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you
4031274 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
4031275 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer
4031276 bitterness is the poison that we drink thinking we are killing the other person
4031277 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
4031278 i could not have imagined it in such a provable form
4031279 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
4031280 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
4031281 the nba the players and the fans relied on him to perform his job in an honest manner
4031282 ive brought shame on myself my family and the profession
4031283 i am conducting additional interviews and hope to obtain additional information from the government my review is well advanced but not complete
4031284 any fan who sees anything other than transparency will have questions
4031285 i think they want to be as much of an open book with fans journalists and researchers as they can possibly be
4031286 we anticipate that the judges sentencing decision together with the changes we have made to our referee operations staff will enable us to continue with the improvements we are making to our anti gambling rules policies and procedures
4031287 there is little comfort to be gained from the mandatory prison sentence especially as it affects mr donaghys children and their mother but hopefully the healing process can begin in earnest for all
4031288 by having this non public information i was in a unique position to predict the outcome of nba games
4031289 he told it all the good the bad and the ugly
4031290 he had to do it because it was the right thing to do the bottom line is that mr donaghy has been a model co operator
4031291 fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail every month they will bear because the water from the sanctuary flows to them their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing

4031295 it was unbelievable especially after being down 17 7 at the half
4031296 i thought that if we held calgary to 23 points we would have a good night
4031297 we held their running back reynolds pretty well but burris is a dangerous guy running and throwing the ball he did a great job
4031298 i dont think we were going all systems go we had plays where we didnt convert they did a lot of things wed seen before but they did them with great effort
4031299 i thought it would be a defensive battle but i didnt think 20 points would be enough to win
4031300 as a defensive line we play hard to try to get to the quarterback thats how you have success
4031301 they had a good defensive game plan but i was disappointed with a couple of throws i made to richardson in the second half that could have changed the game
4031302 last year i had the possibility to fight for the championship its ok but i knew that this year it was not possible anymore if i was racing for mclaren now in this moment maybe i am in the same position as i am now without the possibility to win
4031303 at least i am happy to be with renault with the full support of the team with everyone working night and day to give me the best car
4031304 after last year here there was nothing in my opinion there was nothing to discuss it was more a team decision than a team philosophy
4031305 everyone makes his choices dennis was very clear his philosophy his way to run and to compete is like that as a professional im not like that we choose different ways
4031306 the atmosphere in the team is fantastic and thats also due to heikki we love to work together
4031307 were having a much smoother year its much more relaxed as it should be we dont have any excess baggage on our shoulders
4031308 its a great day for canadians and its very special here at circuit gilles villeneuve
4031309 i thought wed have a lot more guys spin and go off the track but the guys were good
4031310 i was mad that they stopped it but they had to
4031311 we made a little change with the rain tires and that helped
4031312 after that pit stop we were the fastest car on the track
4031313 ill be pinching myself for a couple of hours because this is really cool
4031314 im disappointed because when it rained hard i didnt have a wiper to get rid of the water
4031315 i couldnt see cars three feet in front of me so when he stopped i ran right into him
4031316 it was difficult but we were quick i have no complaints there
4031317 i feel ive come here twice and dominated and didnt win
4031318 maybe i should go have a few beers and wake up with a hangover and forget about it
4031319 poland and australia seemed really focused on getting out fast and responding to what we had planned and did a solid job
4031320 australia however did not have the sprint that we had going into the last part of the race to hold onto their slight lead which was fortunate for us
4031321 the women in the four are up for the challenge
4031322 they know the final will be a tight race and will work on keeping focused the next couple of days
4031323 are more than the requirements and policies of nsg member states or that of the us congress
4031324 the us state department appears to be outsourcing its policymaking to the government of india and its high priced lobbyists
4031325 in short the proposal is an abomination that should be flatly rejected by the nsg
4031326 is the latest step in president george w bushs effort to seek india specific exemptions from us and nsg nuclear trade restrictions on states that do not allow full scope safeguards
4031327 has been weakened further as a result of us acquiescence to indian demands to delete or modify certain sections particularly those that would link nuclear trade with india to its compliance with certain nonproliferation commitments
4031328 if as india is demanding supplier states agree to help india amass a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel or agree to provide lifetime reactor fuel supplies the current nsg exemption
4031329 would allow india to resume nuclear testing without fear of losing access to nuclear fuel supplies
4031330 contrary to the us henry hyde act the 2006 us law regulating future us nuclear trade with india the current us proposal to the nsg fails to specify that if india resumes nuclear testing nuclear trade with india would be terminated
4031331 much weaker formulation that the already weak march 2006 us draft proposal
4031332 in essence the bush administration is proposing an nsg rule change that would not only erode rules based efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons but it would also allow other states to interpret or ignore the india specific nsg guideline as they see fit and undermine how us lawmakers would like to see such a rule applied
4031333 the bush administrations proposed india specific exemption is a nonproliferation disaster that could effectively end the nsg as a meaningful entity
4031334 if nsg states agree under pressure from an outgoing us administration to blow a hole in nsg guidelines in order to allow a few states to profit from reactor and nuclear fuel and technology sales to india they should at a minimum support common sense restrictions and conditions on such trade

4031336 sexuality my dear is a thorn in the flesh of humanity
4031337 do you think its so bad to have a life partner
4031338 its not about bad or not bad this partner or that partner because you remember that feelings can be chosen
4031339 cold calculating and reckoning and to do possibly things to say things which please the masses that is the world of the powerful who work with the acceptance of others
4031340 and if only one lie of seduction leads later to two lies to prevent the detection and two lies for the continuation of the exercise of power then the young connection will soon become a web of lies
4031341 how much more will a person feel loved if he is loved as he is
4031342 and why do not men behave like this possibly because they have other women in mind than that which would remain with them
4031343 time elapsed and i had almost forgotten the window of eternity because my teacher let me investigate the topic of love i should find out the difference between my love for a hamster in my childhood and my first friend in puberty there would be an important insight for me if i occupied myself with the issue as if one young man really could compete with my first hamster
4031344 we are all caught in the idea of a progressive time and because you will not escape from your prison i will halt your time on earth
4031345 but the doubts still held me firmly trapped what if i had a bag over my head would be in concrete and so on
4031346 when you were at the window to eternity you had the opportunity to take this step on your own you would have stopped the time and had noticed that youre in the timeless world being able to move so we will soon head again to the window to eternity to explore the eternity because who knows eternity knows no borders
4031347 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
4031348 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
4031349 what i said was if the red sox think they can find a trade thats going to make their team better and both sides are going to be happy im going to agree but they cannot find a trade its something simple its no big deal

4031352 cant ask for any more fans were great atmosphere was great scoring in my hometown is a dream come true for me playing a game of this importance
4031353 pre game all stars coach steve nicol spoke to me and asked how long i want to play
4031354 i was like man i dont know my mind is wiling but my body isnt
4031355 i was kind of nervous going into the game tonight because obviously it was my first one and id read about the last five years not losing so i was kind of nervous and hoping we were going to win the game
4031356 but as soon as we started the game i knew we were capable of winning it because of the quality weve got in the team
4031357 we knew it was going to be good before the game
4031358 ive not played here before but ive been here before and seen the atmosphere so i was looking forward to it and all the players were looking forward to it and thats what made it extra special
4031359 i think crowds and people and kids have fun when theres a lot of activity on the field when theres a lot of goals and tonight there were a lot of special occasions special moments
4031360 i was going in for the rebound kind of hesitant and then i was like wait wait i think its in i heard the fans cheering thankfully it went in the net
4031361 before the keeper was kind of talking trash to me but i said im not missing this penalty in this game in my hometown
4031362 if you go to toronto fc games they come support regardless of whether beckham is here or not
4031363 but he adds a different element he adds maybe all you guys that wouldnt be here hes a world class player he deserves the attention deserves the credit deserves what he gets
4031364 i was quite surprised at just how good the support was that could have been any ground in england it was that strong
4031365 if i was a toronto player id love to play in front of that every week
4031366 obviously were two weeks into a six week program of pre season so we needed the fitness work and we certainly got that tonight
4031367 the mls players certainly with a couple of goals they scored terrific goals it was a good evening i think everyone can be well pleased with their efforts
4031368 my students they go to u s europe and there they have so much of a basketball culture
4031369 they have shaquille oneal shoes they get from u s my students are from wealthy families
4031370 o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
4031371 the vikings are not commenting on the issue these types of matters are handled by the league
4031372 they feel like favre had something in place and thats why he was so anxious to get his release all of a sudden
4031373 he read about sports he listened to sports he talked sports
4031374 our parents bought him a new suit because he should be graduating
4031375 if you werent talking about sports he didnt know what to talk about
4031376 ive been with the same organization ever since ive been drafted its been eight years now and to sign another long extension like this it feels like exactly the thing we want and the right thing to do
4031377 you cant build a winning team unless you have an owner thats willing to go the extra mile and get the players there that a team needs to get to that next level
4031378 i got a lot of trust in that guy as a person and an owner thats going to be able to do that
4031379 these are the guys youre going to win with these are the guys that are going to teach the young guys how to win and how hard it is to get there
4031380 by being proactive with this deal we avoid being in a situation where shawn could become an unrestricted free agent after next season and the unknown free agency can bring to the organization
4031381 we all truly believe were going to be back there and when we do i think we all realize how far experience goes
4031382 theres a lot to be said with a core group of people staying together and playing together and going through ups and downs
4031383 i couldnt have asked for a better race car it was flawless
4031384 i think as an interim measure it achieved our goals
4031385 i think weve still produced exciting side by side 300 m p h plus close and competitive racing
4031386 in all the years ive been coming out here ive never really been able to get a handle on this track and figure it out
4031387 if they were to change the rules to slow the car down that would cost a lot of teams out there a lot of money
4031388 the cars are still going to make the fire and the ground shake everything they did at 1 320 feet theyre still going to do all the good things everyone wants to see
4031389 one week its the heat the next its the snow
4031390 i better call jesus christ upstairs and tell him to turn the heat down a little bit turn the wind off because the breeze is coming off the lake i cant do that
4031391 these are pro footballers training everyday i dont think it was sluggish
4031392 were disappointed because we know there have been a few games in a row where we should have got something but we didnt
4031393 were frustrated after that game because you do so much but cant put the ball in the back of the net
4031394 but its great to be back i enjoyed my time here its a great place to play so why not enjoy it
4031395 its the training on it that was too much for me
4031396 if there was grass here to train on i would have stayed why would i leave
4031397 im working hard to get them its like everything else you have a target he goes so you go for the next one then you go for the next one
4031398 one of the pieces is almost there and the rest will fall into place once that happens right now i have to go with what i got
4031399 amado had a big chance so its disappointing but its part of the game
4031400 especially being at home and seeing how the last time vancouver whitecaps came in here and got a result
4031401 we have to come out and establish ourselves and show them were playing in a higher league and their league blows so we need to come and establish our authority
4031402 we would rather have the jersey with one second rather than have somebody take it over
4031403 im surprised to hold this jersey this far to be honest with the strength of csc
4031404 we dont have the strongest team for the mountains im aware of that and im sure our competitors are as well
4031405 i think tomorrow depends on what happens over the first climb
4031406 on the first big climb and they are going to get rid of every silence lotto rider there is and cadel is going to be isolated
4031407 once they come on the descent there is a long descent and theyre going to send someone up the valley and force cadel to do work
4031408 for me the stage up lalpe dhuez is the hardest
4031409 christian just has to keep solid because he can ride a great final time trial
4031410 a fairly conservative strategy it will be hard but in the last time trial he is the best rider apart from cadel evans in the top 10 it is just a matter of him being able to hack through
4031411 he makes pitches when he has to and hes got command of both sides of the plate hes exceptional
4031412 something weve been trying to do since i got here was get to 500 and we have managed to do it
4031413 things didnt start out too good on this road trip but it turned out pretty good
4031414 everybody contributed doc did a great job and guys got hits with runners in scoring position and we played great defence
4031415 i dont know how long its been since ive had a hit
4031416 it was nice to finally get one to drop out there
4031417 they came out and finished out what i started from the get go
4031418 i would say in the first game that their bullpen was exceptional and then in the second game halladay was outstanding
4031419 it looked like everything i can throw out there they can hit it like they know its coming its tough
4031420 its not mechanics i think its the location or maybe my pitch selection
4031421 to me it looked like he was under some pitches which means he was bringing the ball up thats tough to do especially with a real aggressive club
4031422 location wise i wasnt as good getting ahead of the count and i cost myself a couple of pitches but zaun did a good job
4031423 he called a good game and we made some good pitches when we had to
4031424 i saw how kick returns were developing through the course of the game we broke a few and we knew we had a chance and in the second half we just came back and attacked them
4031425 it definitely gave us a momentum swing and we took that and rode it to the end of the game
4031426 ian had a crucial return at a crucial moment and that gave us momentum for the game
4031427 hes such a humble guy he comes out every day and works hard and he doesnt get a whole lot of reps on offence but he makes his money on special teams
4031428 we never give up and play 60 minutes the three years ive been here thats been the attitude no matter what the score the games not over
4031429 we just didnt play four quarters thats whats been going on the last three weeks offensively
4031430 weve got to finish drives in that fourth quarter and that was the difference tonight
4031431 its just frustrating right now because we taught ourselves this is what were going to be made of and i go out there and throw an interception that kills us
4031432 i talk about it every year i go by without getting one against calvillo
4031433 i tell him im coming im coming and this was the right time and place
4031434 we spoke to him last night to see how he felt
4031435 even halfway during that he was very fatigued it was very difficult for him to get over the alps why take any physical risks and put a workload on his body
4031436 ricky and billy had a meeting yesterday in which billy admitted he was not going any further
4031437 it was quite emotional because they have been together for so long
4031438 its a sad day billy will always be remembered as one of the worlds great trainers and to go out after a win in front of 58 000 people in manchester will be a fitting end to his career
4031439 having watched porn and seen how the professionals do it i think may women could do with a few lessons my own oral sex technicque on the other had is flawless
4031440 i find myself with an urge to take a piss on a lemon
4031441 hey wait i think lassie is trying to tells something where did they go lassie
4031442 is it just me who find it extremely provoking when some fat bastard is ordering super size deals at your local mcdonalds is an intervention ok some kind of citizens arrest asbo
4031443 and is it just me who find it extremely provoking when some fat bastard is ordering super size deals at your local mcdonalds is an intervention ok some kind of citizens arrest asbo
4031444 youd definitely think that britains fattest man would have said to himself maybe i should ease up on the chips upon discovering for the first time that he couldnt fit through the door
4031445 im clearly on the other side of the fence on this once i only feel sympathy for these folk unless theyre waddling along the pavement really slowly and blocking my progress
4031446 now would be a good time to stop eating could we switch to salads for a while fat girl
4031447 what made their family think it would be a good idea to carry on feeding their bed bound invalid relative 30 000 calories a day
4031448 how come everyone was overflowing with sympathy for george best or even fucking winehouse its no different to them food is a drug
4031449 what made their family think it would be a good idea to carry on feeding their bed bound invalid relative 30 000 calories a day
4031450 well i could believe it of napoleon or his apprentice in filth dave
4031451 visualize that people eat your bread on which your stamp is and they sing praises for you
4031452 the thoughts can not be turned off that is not possible
4031453 when i was growing up my father was fond of using sayings to encourage me to remember important lessons one of his favorites was do you know the difference between a wise man and a fool he would then go on to say that a wise man makes a mistake only once a fool makes the same mistake over and over again
4031454 to put together the best possible standard five man line up two guards two forwards one center with some room for finagling if need be for each team based on the performance of the players while with said team
4031455 sheraton is redefining the hospitality experience by offering our guests technology that will allow them to interact with each other and our hotel in a revolutionary way
4031456 we are proud to partner with microsoft to offer the groundbreaking microsoft surface product which will enable our guests to stay informed connected and entertained while traveling
4031457 were excited to be working with sheraton in its efforts to feature innovation and redefine the guest experience in its hotel properties
4031458 surface takes a common activity such as looking up information about a local city and transforms it into an intuitive and social way for hotel guests to plan their visit we believe this is just the beginning of how surface will completely change the hotel guest experience
4031459 you have to take the good with the bad and not take yourself too seriously
4031460 i think thats the one thing that over the first four or five years in new york i kept knocking myself over the head and trying to re explain myself
4031461 if this gentleman asked me that question i probably wouldve been here for three or four hours trying to explain my personal life and kind of made an ass out of myself really
4031462 everyone goes through personal issues mine are on the front page of the papers im fine with it you have to deal with that challenging times
4031463 ive learned to put whatever issues are on the front page in one small box over here
4031464 and baseball has been a great vehicle for me to keep my mind on what i love to do most to play baseball
4031465 i am so bad at it honestly i would embarrass myself and the whole city of new york i would not want to do that to this great city
4031466 he was a yankee fan i was a met fan thats why everyone hates me
4031467 look into that madonna nonsense too while youre at it
4031468 there are a lot of things the commissioner can do the last thing is something i cant look into
4031469 its just one thing or another but it is what it is
4031470 weve been very consistent finishing in the top five in almost every race
4031471 this just shows how competitive it is in the series
4031472 it would be a record season winning a championship without a win thats not the record you want to have but thats the title you want to have to show its teamwork a team effort
4031473 youre going to see proof of who has the best equipment and the best balance
4031474 nobody has been harassing its been hey i voted for you so many times for the dancing with stars
4031475 i dont mind because of them i won the season
4031476 i knew that they were going slow i didnt want to give my horse too much to do he places himself well and hes got a nice flowing stride when i placed myself early on in the race fairly close i wasnt about to take that away from him the idea was to keep an eye on sailors cap
4031477 he has pain down his left side he is still in the hospital
4031478 in the downhill he hit a rider in front of him and went up in the air for four or five meters
4031479 he told me he had a lot of pain in his left shoulder where he has two or three fractures
4031480 when you look at it a lot of guys made great plays jarious did a tremendous job of letting the athletes be football players and all of a sudden theres a lot of confidence out there
4031481 we had an answer for pretty much what they were throwing to us on defence
4031482 i take that personally weve got to have 42 other guys taking that personally we didnt play with enough heart and we didnt get it done
4031483 if we knew the answer to this problem wed all be breaking down our coachs door to tell him what the solution is
4031484 were just being out performed in every facet right now the offence and defence is working against each other it seems like out there
4031485 hugest thing thats happened to leadville since we discovered gold
4031486 the whole town is buzzing and we are way beyond excited
4031487 a race like this takes a lot of experience and endurance he has that so i guess hes the odds on favourite
4031488 i would reiterate that ill be happy if im top 5 i dont think im in it to win it as they say
4031489 i dont think lance does anything on a lark i think hell be prepared
4031490 i dont know how prepared floyd was last year what im saying is if we were equally prepared i just cant see where those guys wouldnt pummel me
4031491 dave wiens is super human hes just as fantastic on mountain bikes as lance armstrong is on road bikes
4031492 i dont know if i can beat wiens but im 100 per cent sure i can beat carmichael
4031493 i will be home showered and probably three beers in by the time carmichael gets back
4031494 im excited but at the same time right now im like shoot its over with im thinking about toronto
4031495 weve got to do it again next week so it was good to get a win and get some smiles around here in the locker room on everybodys faces things like that but at the same time its over and done with now
4031496 its time to go back to work go back to the drawing board and get another win
4031497 his demeanour was different his leadership in the huddle was different everything was different about him he came out and made great plays and got us a victory
4031498 when we were 0 4 we found ways to lose
4031499 but this week we dug down deep and found a way to win
4031500 it feels good to get the monkey off our back to right the ship for at least one week now we just have to continue to work hard in practice
4031501 i thought we handled this with the utmost professionalism and it showed tonight
4031502 we had to bear down and try to make a few plays and we did
4031503 we were very inaccurate the first half and a lot of that was my fault out there
4031504 we were able to put some good drives together in that second half we adjusted some things at halftime trying to throw the ball underneath a little bit more
4031505 i thought wed take the momentum then and get back in the game
4031506 but to their edmontons credit they took it down the field and responded its very disappointing
4031507 someone is looking after me for evian to be my next win
4031508 all my friends are here it is a very emotional place for me
4031509 the satisfaction of winning and making putts there is no money in the world that can pay for that having memories and having to go through what i have gone through and coming out on top in the end
4031510 i thought my course record was going to fly out of the window
4031511 i was a little nervous and my ball faded to the right i had no shot to the green
4031512 i dont want to be negative about anything thats not who i am i am going to be out here for 10 15 years and i dont think im going to let one tournament get me down
4031513 i feel like a big part of the evian family i will always be here in spirit for sure
4031514 i was ready for a world record my goal today was to beat the world record
4031515 i got out strong i worked my tires i finally executed like i should have at trials
4031516 everybody was saying ah ok isinbayeva is finished we have a new star
4031517 hes ok but he felt his groin cramp up and stopped running as a precaution
4031518 hes not going to take any chances its an olympic year
4031519 we had very good reports on him the biggest thing is he throws strikes thats a great asset for any pitcher
4031520 i was pitching well in triple a and i felt like i wasnt going to go anywhere
4031521 but you know they had to do what they had to do there
4031522 theyre doing something else here in pittsburgh where theyre trying to get younger and refocus and hopefully be like the rays in a couple of years
4031523 i think their scouting report might have been a little bit different because i threw a lot more fastballs this time than i did in wrigley
4031524 i mean we were on him but it was his day thats the only way i can explain it he definitely gave us some pitches to hit
4031525 he was our best pitcher in spring training last year
4031526 i think you tend to be a little more locked in
4031527 most of the games ive pitched its not like im getting five or six runs scored for me it tends to keep you focused
4031528 i thought it was going to be a long day
4031529 and then all right weve got two outs weve got to get another one
4031530 he was hitting his two seamer on both sides and his cutter on both sides
4031531 he made sure he welcomed me to the big leagues
4031532 we need to get a win here this isnt too fun weve got to pick it up when guys are in scoring position weve got to get a knock or get it done some way because this is a pretty frustrating time
4031533 he mixed all his pitches he was very aggressive he worked quick he looked confident all the things you want to see in a young guy it was a pretty good outing really pretty impressive
4031534 any time you come to the big leagues your first time out there youre going to have some butterflies and he did but he kept his composure hes 22 years old the skys the limit for a guy like that
4031535 after that first inning is when i realized you know what this is where i want to be this is where i want to stay
4031536 i tried to keep it like that trying to go out there and finish with seven strong was my idea if it happened it would have been phenomenal for me im just happy i went a couple of innings where i put doughnuts on the board
4031537 seems like every time theres a big trade hes in the middle of it
4031538 that must mean something looks like hes going to have a bright future
4031539 if the caballero fight comes off and were successful through that were probably ready to move downtown potentially
4031540 if we can ever entice a vazquez into this thing boy thats the fight to launch boxing in downtown toronto
4031541 this is one of the best cards ever in this country
4031542 the problem was the offer in the u s was fraught with monopoly money if you will and that turned out to be the case plus it was the wrong decision if it was real
4031543 he goes down there and loses once they put you out with the garbage a 122 pound canadian fighter give me a break here hes got a reputation hes built the industry he has a career after boxing hes a name a brand if he loses he can be rebuilt
4031544 they dont want to be involved anymore in a sport that is dangerous to their image
4031545 its a disappointment for cycling it hurts the sport but we have to thank barloworld because they had nothing to do with this story doping
4031546 as for what well call ourselves lets just forget the name for now what it says on our jersey doesnt matter whether its claudio corti or fiat or our helmet sponsor thats not the point
4031547 vladimir gusev has been officially notified that he no longer represents team astana
4031548 though his results do not indicate the use of forbidden substances vladimirs values exceeded the normal parameters
4031549 its impossible for any team manager to know the activities of riders behind closed doors but we continue to enforce that team astana has a 100 per cent no tolerance policy
4031550 on a brighter note this proves that dr damsgaards system works and we are committed to racing clean
4031551 im just going to have to be as prepared as i can be for the first round
4031552 he has a very good serve and hes a very aggressive player he comes in a lot
4031553 im just going to have to try to keep the pressure on him and see if i can take advantage of the points first itll be a battle out there in who can put the pressure first on every point
4031554 marios going to be a tough guy to get through nevermind djokovic
4031555 so its going to be important for me to focus on my first round match and try to get through that one
4031556 if i do end up getting through that one well see what happens after that
4031557 being in a masters youre going to have to play someone tough
4031558 hey did you see what lance did when he broke out of the peloton in that category two climb to sprint the final leg
4031559 sure did and just wait until he gets to the pyrenees and chases down the yellow jersey
4031560 the tour needs to continue and get to the finish in paris its another blow to the sport but i have to see it in light of the fact that theyre getting caught and going to be thrown out
4031561 its fun when you have a car like that and you can go out there and be aggressive like that
4031562 i wasnt even shaking after that lap it was that good
4031563 got off to a bad start bogeyed the first two holes and i kept my composure after that but somehow my caddie just told me to keep battling keep grinding and came back with two birdies on no 4 and 5 the back nine was obviously very special finishing with five birdies in a row
4031564 obviously no 1 in the world for a while a great player
4031565 i had a chance to play a practice round with him on tuesday great guy a guy who has played many opens so very experienced individual and im glad hes playing good
4031566 we talked about many things and obviously links golf and these type of golf courses he had some good advice and obviously when somebody like that tells you something youd better listen
4031567 when i say funky i obviously dont mean anything bad
4031568 im just saying its so different than what were used to i mean downwind you can hit a driver that goes 370 yards and then you get into the wind and youre hitting a driver 230
4031569 ill keep doing exactly what im doing just have fun with it yes its my first open yes its only my third year on tour but i feel pretty good about myself i feel pretty good about my game and its going to be a good challenge for me
4031570 i love my country its a great great place and i really really miss it just like every country its got its problems and we tend to have that reputation
4031571 but i guarantee everyone in this room when you guys visit its completely different than what the news says print
4031572 bobby murcer was a born yankee a great guy very well liked and a true friend of mine
4031573 i extend my deepest sympathies to his wife kay their children and grandchildren i will really miss the guy
4031574 all of major league baseball is saddened today by the passing of bobby murcer particularly on the eve of this historic all star game at yankee stadium a place he called home for so many years
4031575 bobby was a gentleman a great ambassador for baseball and a true leader both on and off the field he was a man of great heart and compassion
4031576 we used every ounce of strength to go out and play that game we won it for thurman
4031577 if theres a hall of fame for people hes in it
4031578 he was such a good person and he was appreciative of the people who cared so much for him
4031579 that was supposed to be the tag you know he was going to follow mantle and do it with ease
4031580 he certainly understood it its not easy but he wore the mantle with a lot of class and never shied away from the responsibility
4031581 bobby was a great human being he really zeroed in on the person he was with and he was a lot of fun a lot of class hes going to be missed
4031582 just a wonderful person a great teammate and a heck of a baseball player
4031583 he was a great yankee but probably more importantly he was a great friend he always put others first he played the game the right way he got what life was about and that was making life better for the people around you
4031584 he always had that bright smile and that positive spin on everything
4031585 he was the type of guy who never had a bad day
4031586 what he went through the last couple of years no one should ever have to go through but he went through it with such grace he was an amazing amazing guy he was a piece of work in the best way possible
4031587 fear is and will be always the motivator with my golf
4031588 every time i took my winter break i was very anxious that my game would still be there when i came out you can see from my results that i was always good from the start of the year because im anxious to come out and prove myself again
4031589 i have become more comfortable in the past number of years in terms of knowing a certain level of my game would be there
4031590 but definitely after winning a major last year the biggest fear was not to go down the road of guys who have won majors and struggled to keep the intensity after that print
4031591 sorry we had to make it a little bit difficult for you
4031592 i think we probably should have come in but at the end of the day i dont always know whats happening in the garage perhaps we could have done a better job
4031593 i was so concentrated i just wanted to look forward i didnt want to spend too much time looking at how many laps but just focusing
4031594 i didnt have the car to fight it was not possible today
4031595 the last stint i had some problems with the brakes that lost performance a lot
4031596 we were too slow and we need to understand why
4031597 heikki is incredibly sporting he knew the situation he knew it wasnt his day and he took the decision
4031598 it is too early to determine exactly what the cause of the incident was but of course we are investigating
4031599 allco advises that as the documentation is yet to be completed a further extension to the existing senior debt facilities has been granted to 28 august 2008

4031601 alcuni speculatori in questi giorni stanno approfittando della chiusura della maggior parte dei negozi per imporre ulteriori aumenti che rischiano di drogare il mercato e portare a nuovi aumenti a settembre

4031603 from the time these chicks were collected in norway and brought over to scotland in june ive watched them grow up and now theyre raring to go
4031604 mom mom why are people always so suddenly dying in our family
4031605 yes i have to when we continue to see each other then we spend time with each other we are not meant for each other to spend time with each other
4031606 no it must always be a higher meaning it must always have a purpose
4031607 well you will go your way your way is beautiful he will lead you to creative working people who despair in this modern world beause of their creativity creative people are sensitive having a delicate constitution they have extended antennas ready to perceive something when others do not see hear feel or taste creative people are suffering from their work and their life is hard
4031608 how in the hell can we bring him in when he totes a forty five
4031609 if you want that stackerlee you get him by yourself
4031610 i have great confidence the program is strong and they are going in the right direction they have the right blueprint
4031611 without results its just another pretty face that took over tired but couldnt do it
4031612 it was the athletes getting into the start gate and the confidence from the athletes and coaches which spilled out into the system
4031613 he ken thought it would create a conflict down the road
4031614 the read family wins and alpine canada loses a key member of its team
4031615 you can always work your away around things but its not the way that the ski racing world wants to run itself
4031616 you set the bar high and you dont allow people to step under the bar
4031617 that passion and vision that we can win was a fantastic shot in the arm
4031618 when it started to have success people started to jump on board
4031619 without the passion it would have continued on doing what it was doing
4031620 there is always a little disappointment but its better now than 12 months from now where it could be quite disruptive
4031621 i just had to hang in there and gut it out the best i could the ball just wasnt rolling my way
4031622 i got to the first tee and i never played this golf course in this wind before
4031623 i didnt feel that confident with some of the tee shots
4031624 outside of those two hockey sticks sevens it was a good round
4031625 i feel strong i feel good and i feel happy
4031626 i think this is my week i love this tournament and i am in good form especially my putting
4031627 i dont think i have made all 18 greens ever in my life
4031628 i am very happy i shot a good round of golf in unusual conditions with the wind changing direction
4031629 i wouldnt want a steady diet of it but its great to come over here to play these kind of golf courses
4031630 initiated by john denham secretary of state with responsibility for universities the specific themes dius is seeking input on are
4031631 i think a lot of us are enjoying that right now
4031632 i think a lot of things took away the bliss of the triple crown
4031633 i think eight belles i think rick dutrow i think theres a million things i think rick would be the first one to tell you that he would change some things if he could leading up to the belmont its unfortunate
4031634 look i dont mind being the one to pay the price its big brown that paid the ultimate price
4031635 there were people that rooted against big brown due to the connections that was the unfortunate side but look at the end of the day they cant take away the experience we had the memories will last forever it ended up disappointing but for me to say i walk away disappointed winning the kentucky derby and the preakness id be out of my mind
4031636 the haskell is a race and a racetrack that i think is more suitable to him a distance that i right now feel comfortable with and it also allows us more importantly to get another race in between the breeders cup
4031637 i think the spacing from the haskell to another race to the breeders cup is ideal if you go to the travers i think the spacing becomes a little tight
4031638 if he doesnt run his race in the haskell then we missed something
4031639 there is already a myspace account assigned to this email address courtesy graylist
4031640 there are tremendous opportunities in islamic investments in the real estate market in saudi arabia with this summit we aim at further opening the saudi market to foreign investors exploring the investment opportunities within the conventional and real estate sector
4031641 derrick and i had been talking you know all the way through the summer from long beach about trying to put something together and finding sponsorship working on things
4031642 i went to indianapolis for a seat fitting got to know the team and four days later we were at the track
4031643 in between i went home to las vegas and trained like crazy in the 100 degree heat i wasnt in the best shape of my life but definitely was able to carry it through here and was strong all through the race
4031644 im excited for derrick and im excited for tonys team
4031645 i think the equipment theyve got weve shown them what the level is where theyre at so hopefully we can continue
4031646 the whole thing was just a cinderella last minute deal
4031647 that kind of makes you try even harder when you know people are not expecting much from you he drove a terrific race and my guys did a great job too
4031648 in fairness to paul when he came here he wasnt ready for this quite frankly as the race went on i wondered i think his mentality carried over the fitness he needs to get back in racing shape but hes still got the fire in him hes still mad dog tracy thats what you want in a driver
4031649 you always come in knowing the competition is where its at and that its going to be an uphill struggle
4031650 without the help and guidance of the vision team and some of my friends wed have been finding things out the second time around and that wouldnt have worked
4031651 there was action all the way through i was fighting with many different drivers passed a lot of guys made a lot of really daring passes in the infield you know i got this opportunity and we cashed in on it print
4031652 the fifth principle the intellect has unfolded to a certain degree
4031653 all of us did a better time than in the prelims our goal was to get the medal after we finished second in the prelims
4031654 ive been working hard on my backstroke this year for the games
4031655 its really nice to break that barrier although it wasnt something that i felt was crucial at this point in the season
4031656 everybody stepped up their game tonight and we are bang on track where we want to be
4031657 the performance tonight showed me that i have a whole heck of lot left in the tank
4031658 i had a wonderful experience and when i look back on my career i will always think about that
4031659 i think it was really a turning point in my career and as a person i really dont know why michelle continues to do this we have a major this week and if you cant qualify for a major i dont see any reason why you should play with the men
4031660 i feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction she was so good a couple of years ago when she finished second a few times
4031661 im sure if you put yourself enough times in that position then you can deal with it and i think its how you become better thats how you learn to win
4031662 we have got some great great players on the lpga right now
4031663 obviously morgan pressel has won and paula creamer is a fantastic player and you have a bunch of young koreans
4031664 i think if wie wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win winning is what we are out here for but i just dont see the interest really on being on the mens tour
4031665 i thought she had quit that idea but obviously not
4031666 hopefully we can get something resolved ive been saying that for quite a while now i dont want to say were running out of time but i need to get into a camp somewhere
4031667 i dont know anything other than what happened today on the practice field and i dont want to address any more speculation at this point bretts situation will resolve itself during the coming days i would assume but at this point and time all i can comment on is our football team and what we did today
4031668 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
4031669 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
4031670 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
4031671 obviously theres no closure as of yet but i think weve kind of been told whats going on and i think we all kind of know where everything stands
4031672 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
4031673 now its just about the packers and not about the situation its over now from what i understand its pretty much over
4031674 i think for the most part the locker room would have liked to see him back here
4031675 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
4031676 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
4031677 shalvis talent for penning excellent stories has never ceased to amaze me
4031678 creates compelling characters that deeply hits the heart of the reader
4031679 jill shalvis writes exciting and thrilling suspense filled romance hooked from page one
4031680 riveting suspense laced with humor and heart is her hallmark and jill shalvis always delivers
4031681 for those of you who havent read jill shalvis you are really missing out
4031682 jill shalvis displays the soul of a poet with her deft pen creating a powerful atmosphere
4031683 jill shalvis is a breath of fresh air on a hot humid night
4031684 it was kind of a taboo i just had to respect the pain and the family i just had to cope with it
4031685 it was more surprising than about getting mad over it for her
4031686 i was totally surprised because he had never said this before
4031687 i made him wait two years to be sure that it was not just a daydream
4031688 im quite used to having a lot of attention since the beginning when there was no reason to have attention it was just because of the name but now it is because of the name and because im doing quite well and maybe on the verge of going to f1 and i think people recognize my work
4031689 hopefully most of the interest that im getting which is growing with each race is because of the results
4031690 with his victory in monaco senna moved into the field of vision
4031691 they have a red bull driver lineup which is a priority toro rosso is a red bull team but i want an opportunity in f1 whether its toro rosso or another
4031692 not at all i had very good bases and it helped me to grow and be strong inside when i have bad results i dont get down inside i keep up the momentum the energy im still pushing strong to come back
4031693 not only can you trust your family its a good relationship we have they have the experience from ayrtons time they know a bit though they werent as connected to motor racing as they are now
4031694 we have very similar lines and very similar ways of speaking and dealing with things
4031695 its not at all true that ive signed for vancouver i havent even decided whether i should keep playing hockey yet
4031696 if i play its going to be for the entire season that means i would be there at the start when the training camp begins
4031697 if youre a professional hockey player then the money is part of the picture ahead of making a decision
4031698 but there are other things that matter if it was just the money then i would have already signed for vancouver
4031699 nothing has been ruled out i got a very good offer from them too and also from montreal
4031700 but vancouvers contract was in a class of its own if you look at the money
4031701 it feels like home but lets see i havent gotten as far as thinking about clubs yet
4031702 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
4031703 he actually couldnt believe that ive been playing this long with this injury you can imagine that i was not very thrilled to hear that my medical team did not see this tear in my shoulder back in april
4031704 the good news is that it didnt get much worse since april but we could have started the healing time back then instead of now
4031705 after yesterdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
4031706 overall ive been working hard and trying to leave an impression on the coach
4031707 being a returning guy a lot of guys have been asking questions and i try to lead by example mostly with my work ethic and show it takes a lot to win a gold medal
4031708 but i still have to earn my spot so it gives me a little bit of an extra push to go a little bit harder and make sure i get my own spot
4031709 he seems to be more mature he seems to be more confident in himself with less pressure on his shoulders
4031710 i thought last year at the super series he had a ton of pressure on his shoulders and hes much more relaxed this year so its nice to have him at camp in that state of mind and hes been working hard and been doing what hes supposed to do
4031711 were happy with him and im pretty sure hes looking to have a very good start with oshawa and its something we look forward to to evaluate down the road
4031712 i think im a little more comfortable and a little more relaxed
4031713 ive been very anxious to get this camp underway and im excited i definitely understand how to handle it better and being through it before definitely helps
4031714 theres a lot of guys who might make the nhl and are big question marks
4031715 i understand that a lot of those guys might not be back but even if i make the 13th forward again id be pretty excited
4031716 weve got some first class guys in adam graves and pete deboer stepping in
4031717 have been deceived and trusting those who didnt deserve it
4031718 despite all of our efforts trusting the effectiveness of internal and external tests we havent been able to avoid this absurd situation and friday as a team we feel like victims
4031719 i had a great relationship with the crowd in montreal
4031720 i still get letters from people in montreal i look forward to being back in two years
4031721 we have to find out what it is because its very strong thats why i cancelled the trip
4031722 my goal is to help womens tennis and this is the only womens tournament in the country
4031723 that would be amazing but ill need to find a lot of money for that
4031724 sastres ride in the time trial today for me was a real surprise
4031725 on the climbs csc were so strong it comes down to they have two or three times the budget we do
4031726 they can straight away buy much better quality riders strength in numbers it was no surprise
4031727 i got some time checks from the other riders and thought whats going on here
4031728 i am still bruised and sore from the first week i wore the yellow jersey and was able to defend the yellow jersey
4031729 when you are considered a favourite it is even more difficult to win a stage as you are a more watched rider instead of two or three riders worrying about you maybe there is 10 or the whole peloton
4031730 ive never made this much money off one contest its amazing
4031731 a lot of people doubted us i turned it over to the skaters and let them design the course and the format im so excited ive never been so happy
4031732 it just goes to show what you get when you have guys like that and money is no problem
4031733 look what they built i wish they could leave this stuff instead of tearing it down its amazing
4031734 this was by far the best skating that ive ever seen in a vert competition
4031735 it was by far the best vert ramp because it works it has offsets extensions ledges it has it all
4031736 given the underperformance of lambs the recent resignation of marketing head dennis rice the dearth of greenlights and the pr quagmire enveloping valkyrie the studio has had a difficult time engendering confidence
4031737 elke bacterie op zijn huid kan voedselvergiftiging bij de klanten veroorzaken
4031738 elke bacterie op zijn huid kan voedselvergiftiging bij de klanten veroorzaken
4031739 im lucky that im one of the very few guys that get a chance to have something like that happen
4031740 theres no question it is extra pressure but i enjoyed it
4031741 im glad im not playing golf im gonna be sitting on a beach
4031742 it has been an exhausting two weeks i cant believe its only been two weeks i seems like ive been on the road for a month the last two weeks have been pretty tough all the way around
4031743 i hit it well here and i putted pretty well
4031744 ive always planned to do four years of school and get a degree
4031745 college life college golf its pretty awesome i really dont want to miss two years of it
4031746 i havent really thought about turning pro and i probably wont until im done school
4031747 it seems like he has a steady game he isnt a long bomber or anything but maybe he can learn that consistent game
4031748 i missed every putt that length until 18 so im glad i made it on the final hole i missed maybe four or five six footers today
4031749 i could have even salvaged a 1 under par day if my putter was better
4031750 the race did not quite go as expected but felt easy
4031751 a bit more work to do and everything should be fine for beijing
4031752 there are a lot of people running fast at the moment and i dont see any one athlete as being my main competitor
4031753 the way i am running at the moment i feel i am in the best shape i have been in
4031754 i really felt i could jump a world record today
4031755 ive got one more competition then a rest for two weeks before beijing
4031756 its going to be a hard competition and it might be necessary to break a world record to win
4031757 it started off pretty good but at the end i think i was trying too hard and i didnt go with what i had been working on in practice
4031758 my preparations are going really well so im really disappointed in todays performance
4031759 to get a win so close to the olympics is very good psychologically
4031760 my past two races werent that good at all so having this win against some good competition is a great boost for me
4031761 im going to make sure i dont lose again because if i lose the next one it means i lose gold
4031762 i cant afford to lose the one thats coming up the olympics
4031763 i am feeling very confident my chances are as good as anyone else
4031764 ive got two weeks training now and i am feeling in great shape
4031765 the distances werent there tonight but the win will give me a lot of confidence for beijing
4031766 it was important for us to give a good start and we did that and hopefully well carry on
4031767 on this occassion it rain helped us i suppose we were allowed to get off to rethink and regroup
4031768 i thought early on today our intensity in the field was not quite what it was
4031769 all youre going to get is quality for me its fantastic
4031770 we want to show people what were made of and this is the perfect way to do it
4031771 guys understand this is a big opportunity to show were good enough
4031772 if anyone comes in and thinks this is a walk in the park im going to let them know
4031773 theyre going to be a very good team and theyre going to be difficult to play against
4031774 i think theyll be as prepared as any team weve ever played in an all star game
4031775 it feels like some of the games we play in europe i hope theyre in full voice and make the night special
4031776 definitely a couple of days ill always remember it was pretty special
4031777 i hit a little blooper off the fist over the second baseman got a hit and an rbi thats definitely something that sticks out in my mind
4031778 as i get older im sure it will turn into a line drive to right field in a playoff game against one of the best closers of all time to be able to get a hit off him in that situation was pretty cool
4031779 catfish hunter we got hooked up and i ended up beating him
4031780 reggie jackson was on the team complete ballgames are always fun to do yankee stadium was fun to come to
4031781 one is the game against boston july 1 2004 when derek jeter went into the stands thats probably the best game 5 4 yankees win in 13 innings ive ever seen live
4031782 and alex rodriguezs 500th home run last year was pretty emotional
4031783 every day you think about how many great players how many hall of famers walked down this hall
4031784 then going down through the runway into the dugout is pretty special because you see the light coming out theres a sign there that everybody touches
4031785 i want to thank the good lord for making me a yankee
4031786 and i remember the big day roy howell had thats what sticks out in my mind
4031787 it was one day where the guys had a lot of fun in a season where we didnt play well
4031788 i think weve had some better series but just the fact that its the yankees at yankee stadium and its something the blue jays havent done a whole lot that made it a lot different
4031789 it was a 3 2 pitch it was out to the black seats in dead centre on mickey mantle day thats probably one of the highlights of my career there
4031790 i remember walking in and i remember looking up and you see the facade
4031791 you look around and think of whos played there with the monuments in the outfield all that kind of stuff then once the game starts you try to put out of your mind that youre on the same field the mickey mantle played on print
4031792 i dont feel like it i just want you to hold me
4031793 youre just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man
4031794 cant you just love me for who i am and not what i do for you in the bedroom
4031795 i think this is all dear lets go to the cashier
4031796 honey i just want you to hold this stuff for a while youre just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman
4031797 why cant you just love me for who i am and not for the things i buy you
4031798 i dont know if its that we need different players it may just be the way we approach the game or the way we play the game needs to be different
4031799 i dont always think bringing in different guys is the answer i think a lot of times it has to do with your attitude and the way were playing
4031800 is there a certain team approach we kind of take on where were playing series this way or games this way i just dont think we have an identity and thats something i think cito is bringing i feel like theres more of an emphasis on winning and progressing thats better
4031801 theres just those little things as to how youre going to go about it and maybe thats what we need to have a little bit of a better direction of where were going and what we need to do
4031802 ive always said right from the beginning id much rather win the world series in toronto than anywhere else and honestly its something i havent even contemplated yet i sill have two years left and i want to win those next two years and at that point well decide from there what happens next
4031803 not knowing how much longer youre going to play if its a last contract type of thing
4031804 id love to see him stay id love to see him be a part of this we can obviously use him
4031805 i think we have a pretty understanding group we know what were up against and what were facing right now ive always had trust in j p and the people making decisions
4031806 as much as i like burnett and want him there i would understand any decision that was made
4031807 were still halfway through i really hate to turn the page on the season but those are things we talked about going into spring training
4031808 those teams are going to have those things sometimes and you have to take advantage of it obviously thats what the rays have done this year you dont expect either of those teams to struggle for long if they do you have to capitalize on it and unfortunately we didnt thus far
4031809 its tough when you see that there was a little bit of a window
4031810 i laughed and then i thought about it in 1930 bill terry hit 401 and so in 41 when williams hit 406 it had been done pretty recently
4031811 whoever goes after it now the scrutiny is going to be unbelievable
4031812 i saw john olerud hit 400 until august i saw george brett and carew do it i dont know how anyone is going to do better than those guys
4031813 if ever anyone approached it to me it would be if a guy had some injuries maybe barely qualified a player needs a minimum of 502 plate appearances to win a batting title and somehow got hot right at the end to push him over
4031814 from may of 1985 to may of 1986 over 162 games i hit 408 but i didnt do it in one season
4031815 it was always in the back of my mind the pressure would be unbelievable because youd be holding press conferences every day talking about it
4031816 it would be a distraction and i dont foresee anyone doing it
4031817 if it were to happen it would have to be some switch hitter who can really run a guy like ichiro suzuki if he were a switch hitter it would have to be a speed guy who beat out a lot of infield hits
4031818 ted williams was the best pure hitter ive ever seen play he had such a great swing great strike zone knowledge of the game he didnt make a lot of outs by swinging at bad pitches
4031819 it 1941 was an unusual year and i dont think well see the likes of that again
4031820 thats the one i feel like someone sooner or later is going to do
4031821 september is going to be ungodly for whoever makes a run at 400 because every day youre going to have to talk about starters how you feel
4031822 its going to take a strong guy mentally to get it done because its tough enough just going out on the field and doing it on a daily basis having to answer the same questions over and over again mentally that wears on you a little bit
4031823 i never got to that point i didnt get the chance
4031824 nobody really gave us a shot coming out of spring training and everyone in our clubhouse believed that we have a good team and had talent
4031825 our pitching has been great were getting timely hits everything when youre the underdog its a lot of fun to beat people when nobody really expects you to
4031826 hes one of the most talented athletes in all the big leagues
4031827 we have a chance to be a pretty good team for a while
4031828 hes always got the last word hes got the pen and paper to write out the lineup card but i try to state my case every time he tries to take me out
4031829 i tell him im good to go but the fact ive played at third base this year has helped me out a lot
4031830 third base coach larry bowa has had a huge impact on that
4031831 i took ground balls every day at shortstop during spring training and stuff and ever since then they were like wow he can actually play a little bit of infield
4031832 its given me an opportunity to get a mental break too from catching
4031833 it was a very strong performance from us and it just showed that we are very competitive and that we didnt have any problems
4031834 its going to be close with ferrari but i feel strong i feel we can definitely challenge for the front row
4031835 tomorrow will be very close within a couple of tenths of a second
4031836 i feel good i feel comfortable i feel pretty relaxed
4031837 i feel much more positive and confident as a driver than i did last year
4031838 there was some standing water i lost control of the car and hit the barrier
4031839 i dont think one race gives you momentum it gives you a boost
4031840 we had a good race and hopefully we can get a good race this weekend and score some points and then build the momentum
4031841 we wanted to create a forum for fans voices to be heard
4031842 i dont understand how you deny somebody that threw for 4 000 yards last season a starting position i can think of at least 25 teams in the nfl that would jump at the opportunity to have brett favre be their starting quarterback
4031843 this is a hot button issue that surpasses anything ive ever gone through
4031844 segments addressing issues that the two men have with themselves each other and the world at large
4031845 then they introduced baby jabba aka rotta the huttlet aka stinky at the point of this characters introduction it officially became the worst character in the history of star wars
4031846 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
4031847 today hes been in better spirits because hes focused on getting ready hes cut from the same cloth hes got a job to do
4031848 we had to make some decisions on whether we were going to race today because we still have a tour and we still have points and money and fans that are coming into dawson creek to watch
4031849 herman was one of the most respected men that our sport has ever seen he is a grandfather to everybody
4031850 he was the first ever winner of our tour back in the 90s hes just going to be a man thats going to leave a big whole in everybodys heart
4031851 he was always the guy who didnt want to do nascar on the wagon he just wanted one sponsor treat that sponsor right and he didnt want a sticker on every corner just to get an extra few bucks that wasnt hermans style
4031852 dallas even while losing his battle with cancer was still around and still encouraging other guys and still helping people and still training horses
4031853 yeah were going to have to do that because you cant putt it across these greens
4031854 and in only one day its crazy how much faster and harder they are
4031855 they were already tough holes when we had say a 4 iron in our hand but now with 3 woods theyre very difficult
4031856 but this is certainly the hardest group of par 3s ive ever played
4031857 you know if youre hitting those clubs youre going to miss some of those greens
4031858 even hitting a good shot youre going to miss some of those greens print
4031859 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
4031860 i had my heart set on tottenham and i didnt think about going to any other club
4031861 ive come here with a big price tag and i owe tottenham a lot for paying that out i have to repay tottenham with all my effort and all my heart
4031862 i prefer to limit my quotes to players in my squad and players in my team
4031863 something similar happened last month with us and i think its better for us if i stick to that
4031864 hes a very technical skillful player and hes got an exquisite touch
4031865 tactically and strategically im sure he will bring a lot to our side and i hope that we can help him maximize his potential
4031866 thats in the past i grew up through the arsenal youth team but its not a problem for me
4031867 all my heart is at tottenham and all my passion will be channelled into doing well for tottenham
4031868 or other electronic surveillance conducted by you or others on your behalf
4031869 following his successful privacy claim and the attempts by the editor and staff of the news of the world to devalue the outcome of that claim mr mosley will now be pursuing a claim for damages and aggravated damages in relation to defamatory allegations in the 6th april edition of the news of the world
4031870 was intended to be an enactment of nazi behaviour or adoption of any of its attitudes
4031871 clearly it would be regarded defamatory in the minds of most people to say that somebody behaved in a way that was nazi
4031872 was not intended to be and was not nazi in character
4031873 in the past a public figure has known that scandalous and immoral behaviour carries serious consequences for his or her public profile reputation and job
4031874 today it is possible to both have your cake and eat it too
4031875 modern adults dont care what other people do so long as its legal private and consensual between adults
4031876 the process for me was something that took a lot of time to come to terms with
4031877 we all know we probably werent all on the same page in certain areas
4031878 it wasnt going to work if two people arent on the same page thats why the meeting was healthy because we both realized that there were differences in philosophy
4031879 hes a good person that first year we snuck into the playoffs this year obviously was a sub par season
4031880 i was a little bit surprised but at the end of the day they made a decision and are moving in a new direction
4031881 there have been philosophical differences and weve agreed its a good time for me to move on
4031882 i want to thank the islanders organization for giving me a chance to coach in the nhl again i have tremendous respect for what the team is trying to do and i wish them well
4031883 we dont have natural 50 goal scorers we have guys who work for everything they get thats the way we play
4031884 i thought bill guerin and miro satan were pretty good goal scorers thats all water under the bridge it doesnt do anyone any good now to comment about it but last summer ted was in on the process of bringing in free agents
4031885 there wasnt a situation where there was a player in that locker room that ted didnt want
4031886 teams that are successful with the salary cap and the new things in the league have been able to develop talent in their system with good draft picks and have good free agent signings
4031887 we have a lot of exciting guys coming in we need somebody that is going to be able to grow and teach those guys to become nhl players
4031888 im just playing great right now and obviously a lot has to do with playing with nenad
4031889 nenad played some unbelievable points in the tiebreaker to keep us in there
4031890 we were up 6 3 bob serving and i kind of liked our chances at that point
4031891 but they played a few spectacular shots and i dont think we won another point the momentum just shifted
4031892 from the beginning of the week i wasnt returning well
4031893 i had some trouble with my hand and danny was the one that was very consistent
4031894 i was trying to help him as much as i could but today i felt like the level of our tennis went a little bit higher which we had to do against the bryans
4031895 we were playing with good energy and the crowd was awesome
4031896 this was just a great match and a great atmosphere
4031897 he was feeling really good and he felt he was ready to run a canadian record for the last while
4031898 we were hoping for a personal best and we knew he was in shape to do it
4031899 especially after getting tripped in london on saturday its nice to come back this way
4031900 obviously i do think it holds a really special place in his heart
4031901 from the first time the opportunity became available michael felt like we had to put a deal together and make a deal happen
4031902 so many great champions and i think in a way that feeds into the heritage of open wheel racing and indycar racing
4031903 i know the indy toronto event is going to be very special for fans here in canada and especially here in toronto they love their open wheel racing
4031904 everyone weve visited theyve just been so excited to know were going to be back
4031905 the reception that we had here in toronto with the province with city officials with tourism with the offficials at exhibition place its such an attitude of can do i think next july people will really see that and were looking forward to that
4031906 we want somebody who just wants to really get out there get their name out there work with us in the market and were pretty close
4031907 were actually in draft stage in a contract with a title partner
4031908 weve got a lot of those building blocks in place and i think were pretty close to having that last building block there were going to very proud of this event next year i can promise you that
4031909 it is my left knee which is why when it hurts a lot i dont tend to play so well
4031910 but when i went out today i looked at the scores and i thought that level par would be a pretty good number
4031911 i pitched just short of the green and then pitched over the bunker to 12 feet and made that for a bogey five
4031912 i thought i would have made eight but i went from eight to five in one hole
4031913 im not out there to prove anything just trying to enjoy my game
4031914 i know my time is limited i have only a few more years as a golfer im really having a lot of fun on the champions tour
4031915 i had a mechanical problem with my suspension and had to stop twice in the technical zone for assistance
4031916 after that i was able to catch catharine and take a lead but then on the last lap i crashed pretty hard in the downhill and she was able to catch up to me again
4031917 i was pretty impressed with the way derek was riding
4031918 i was riding within myself but he was pushing me and there was no margin for error with him so close
4031919 cest moins dramatique que ne le laissaient redouter les derni res rumeurs
4031920 des d penses de consommation des m nages en recul et des investissements plus faibles
4031921 le r sultat de la premi re moiti de lann e est conforme aux attentes r agit sylvain broyer analyste chez natixis
4031922 nous avions pr vu laffaiblissement de la croissance au deuxi me trimestre
4031923 l conomie allemande ne devrait pas tomber en r cession au troisi me trimestre
4031924 i took that hard core reputation and sort of cranked it up a couple notches
4031925 daniel tried to laugh but that had always been too hard for him hed never had anything to celebrate not once in his whole life
4031926 knockemstiff specialize in messing up they mess up their own lives and the lives of the people around them it seems to be the only thing theyre good at as one character puts it forgetting our lives might be the best well ever do
4031927 it helped me sort of being on my own i was reading stuff i liked and wasnt forced to read stuff i didnt like
4031928 normally we would have the appropriations process done by the fourth of july
4031929 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
4031930 i can put the great tradition in one word privilege
4031931 so hes actually between 235 and 240 as hes sparring because a lot of people were concerned that with the extra weight on that he was going to be slower actually i think he will be just as quick if not quicker now
4031932 when hes inside the octagon just because of his body shape he looks still very lean very tall and very lanky
4031933 but when you get up close to him you can see hes a big guy hes not small guy he just has that appearance because hes so tall and lanky but hes muscle all the way around
4031934 im going to go in there and im going to try and take the rifle out of his hands and im going to try and hunt him down the whole time
4031935 i have nothing to prove i have nothing to lose its a win win fight for me i think im going to shock a lot of people i plan on it
4031936 i think hes definitely a valid contender a valid opponent
4031937 he does have the fastest knockout in ufc history so hes got heavy hands hes big hes strong hes quick so i think its a great challenge anderson and his whole team all of us are really looking forward to seeing this happen
4031938 anderson is taking this very seriously hes not underestimating james irvin whatsoever
4031939 basically when dana white put up the opportunity he jumped at the challenge
4031940 it wasnt something that he silva was planning on but he wants to challenge himself and he felt that this fight at 205 pounds and being on short notice it was the kind of challenge he really needed to motivate him right now
4031941 if theres big fights out there at the 205 pound weight division that are the fights that the fans and the world want to see that the ufc thinks they can make big fights out of and that challenge him thats what he wants to do
4031942 i think georges st pierre is a very great fighter but i think georges st pierre still has to prove himself in the 170 pound division
4031943 he hasnt even successfully defended his title once so i think that anything is a possibility but as of right now i still think georges st pierre needs to prove himself a little more in the welterweight division
4031944 i dont have anything against those guys but right now im focused on james irvin
4031945 it is my left knee which is why when it hurts a lot i dont tend to play so well
4031946 but when i went out today i looked at the scores and i thought that level par would be a pretty good number so i am pretty pleased with that
4031947 im not out there to prove anything just trying to enjoy my game i know my time is limited i have only a few more years as a golfer and im really having a lot of fun on the champions tour
4031948 it gave me a lot of confidence and if i missed the shots its no problem because im putting good i play very relaxed still 1 under and its good im still happy
4031949 i pitched just short of the green and then pitched over the bunker to 12 feet and made that for a bogey 5
4031950 i thought i would have made 8 but i went from 8 to 5 in one hole
4031951 its a good feeling to get off that quickly but its never expected
4031952 even if it sounds easy its never that easy its a much shorter span of time but to play that well you have to be moving your feet very quickly and doing everything effectively
4031953 i was more focused on what i could do how i could play better than thursday
4031954 im really pleased with the way i made an adjustment
4031955 tursunov is a great player and hes a guy that can give you a hard time
4031956 thats strange these days in tennis top seeds get upset all the time
4031957 its really not easy to go through and beat every guy youre expected to beat you know anyone can beat you on a given day
4031958 i might have gotten a little content or lazy or something and he picked it up in the second set
4031959 after he got up a break in the third i got it back together i put some returns in the court and started picking up my game a little
4031960 when you play tommy the hardest thing is to return he has a second serve that is hard to read and you dont know where its coming
4031961 we all want to do well our expectations are to do well but i havent set any type of goal on myself that we have to win the race
4031962 were just going to take it step by step every day from my standpoint this is my opportunity to get back in the indycar series
4031963 you really have to be quick here to do well
4031964 if youre not on the pace youre really going to struggle so from that standpoint the cars got to be good here
4031965 to stay at the front you have to have the pace to do well because its not that difficult to pass
4031966 the only one straightaway you have here you have a chicane in the middle of it thats flat out with a big giant bump in the middle which launches the car
4031967 when you get in the back and everything restarts the guy in the front goes and they stop and go and everybody is tensed up wanting to go its a lot easier to get in an accident than it appears on tv
4031968 when you see the opening story on espn on tv is danica and milka duno that makes it a big deal thats what the series needs to do to get to the next level
4031969 they seemed enthusiastic and very genuinely interested in me coming to play there
4031970 its a big part of why i decided to go back because i feel very comfortable with this group as well as the head coach
4031971 initially last year it was our coach who wanted us to contact her
4031972 theyve met and they have the same views i think it suits hayley fine
4031973 she has been in the top level of womens ice hockey for 15 years now and our team needs her experience
4031974 for me im always looking to push myself and become better and i felt like i needed to get out of my comfort zone again
4031975 repetition and working on your skill set at a high level and a high speed against players who are bigger stronger and faster is always a good thing when i come back to the womens game i have more time and space so it helps my poise and patience on the ice
4031976 it made me a better player the first time i went over and i expect it to be the same this time
4031977 youre not getting rich im making a salary i can live off of but for us and what im looking for theyve come through
4031978 theyve been very good at taking care of every detail
4031979 im trying to get myself a pass to go to the athletes village and use the gym but being media i realize they dont want me there
4031980 i was watching not bourbon i was tracking him the whole way
4031981 around the turn coming to the 3 8 pole i was trying to point harlem rocker outside because i have to make sure i had a clear spot
4031982 not bourbon was still between horses and kind of fighting his way through so i made the decision to try and get the jump on him
4031983 i thought he saddled much too quiet to be honest with you
4031984 i was really kind of upset that he wasnt getting hot because thats his norm to get warm
4031985 then jono jockey jono jones said he never settled in the race at all at the 5 8th pole he settled some for him but when he asked him he didnt get that fire and he finished a very tired horse no question
4031986 im not saying hes really bred to be a true mile and a half grass horse
4031987 if you run a horse thats not really suited for that then you can whack him out
4031988 today horses arent as sound as they used to be and not everybody does every dance
4031989 i dont think so but theres another thing you dont really know
4031990 i had never seen any sign of why that would affect him in his works but he didnt work among other horses either i dont know i really dont know
4031991 all i know is i got humbled and thats why you dont say too much and get too boastful going into a race because quite often it will kick you in the backside
4031992 i just believe last time he didnt care for the polytrack
4031993 that was the only thing i could say about that
4031994 but he proved today hes back and hes going to be ok for the summer
4031995 he has the ability to run against grade 1 horses but needs to put all of that together
4031996 so hes actually between 235 and 240 as hes sparring because a lot of people were concerned that with the extra weight on that he was going to be slower actually i think he will be just as quick if not quicker now
4031997 when hes inside the octagon just because of his body shape he looks still very lean very tall and very lanky
4031998 but when you get up close to him you can see hes a big guy hes not small guy he just has that appearance because hes so tall and lanky but hes muscle all the way around
4031999 im going to go in there and im going to try and take the rifle out of his hands and im going to try and hunt him down the whole time
4032000 i have nothing to prove i have nothing to lose its a win win fight for me i think im going to shock a lot of people i plan on it
4032001 i think hes definitely a valid contender a valid opponent
4032002 he does have the fastest knockout in ufc history so hes got heavy hands hes big hes strong hes quick so i think its a great challenge anderson and his whole team all of us are really looking forward to seeing this happen
4032003 anderson is taking this very seriously hes not underestimating james irvin whatsoever
4032004 basically when dana white put up the opportunity he jumped at the challenge
4032005 it wasnt something that he silva was planning on but he wants to challenge himself and he felt that this fight at 205 pounds and being on short notice it was the kind of challenge he really needed to motivate him right now
4032006 if theres big fights out there at the 205 pound weight division that are the fights that the fans and the world want to see that the ufc thinks they can make big fights out of and that challenge him thats what he wants to do
4032007 i think georges st pierre is a very great fighter but i think georges st pierre still has to prove himself in the 170 pound division
4032008 he hasnt even successfully defended his title once so i think that anything is a possibility but as of right now i still think georges st pierre needs to prove himself a little more in the welterweight division
4032009 i dont have anything against those guys but right now im focused on james irvin
4032010 we went out there to win but the u s was just the better crew on the day
4032011 a lot of crews went out hard at the start and we were definitely challenged by poland which made it very exciting
4032012 its great to see canada back on the podium in this event again
4032013 it was a great battle with casey it was fun a lot of fun in this race
4032014 we knew we had to be perfect to win today
4032015 we made a few changes this morning in warmup that made us faster in the race
4032016 he played tremendous defence as well he is one of the top three players in the world and im very happy for him
4032017 that the action that mr vandenbussche engaged in was not voluntary as it related to the officers that it was not the product of an operating mind
4032018 i want to use what ive learned through my 10 year nhl career to help young people i am hopeful i will be given another opportunity to coach so i can not only help young men become better hockey players but also better people
4032019 its the no 1 thinking game and the no 1 fighting game
4032020 thats not functional so i thought about how it could work
4032021 it was a catastrophe i lost my queen in the second round of chess
4032022 for those who have been wondering about the extent of public support for looking further and deeper into the vagaries of election 2004 i offer the following from a zogby national survey taken recently 12 1 04 12 3 04
4032023 du musst sie mehr waagerecht halten damit sich das gold unten absetzt
4032024 insgeheim glaubt jeder an einen gro en schatz man spricht nicht dar ber
4032025 es ist keine geldgier sondern goldgier man will es einfach besitzen
4032026 as the new ceo of usa track amp field i have a moral and practical duty to make the case against her request
4032027 with her cheating and lying marion jones did everything she could to violate the principles of track and field and olympic competition
4032028 when she came under scrutiny for doping she taunted any who doubted her purity talent and work ethic just as she had succeeded in duping us with her performances she duped many people into giving her the benefit of the doubt
4032029 even a second place finish will be considered a disappointment but at least i have a good car and a good team and that should remove a big part of any excuses
4032030 the good thing is that its ok to age in nascar so you have a longer career in nascar
4032031 having a good race here could give a positive feedback to potential sponsors which would help in getting a full ride
4032032 that would be great because that would take the pressure away from me so ill be very happy if he gets all the pressure
4032033 the bank of the west has been one of my favourite tournaments to play throughout my career
4032034 unfortunately my knee has not healed sufficiently since wimbledon to allow me to compete
4032035 its just a bad image its an image we dont need
4032036 what those athletes did was a major disrespect to the sport but at the same time its not the entire team that did that and its not necessarily the coach that condoned that
4032037 oh canada cfl cheerleader shows more than her patriotic side
4032038 many of the photos are dated from no later than 2005 and involve individuals who no longer have a connection with the franchise or have never been affiliated with blue lightning at all
4032039 i dont think its a big deal at all its an isolated incident
4032040 no matter what anyone says he fedor is the best heavyweight in the world at this point until someone beats him
4032041 obviously it means that theyre paying attention to us obviously it means were some kind of a threat to them they wouldnt be doing it if we werent
4032042 his ground and pound is probably the best ive ever seen
4032043 so matchup wise i think its going to be a very good fight
4032044 although tim is not the most athletic fighter in the world hes very good at what he does
4032045 hes very long he uses his length he uses a good long left hand to hide his right hand and to hit you with a powerful right hand hes very good at keeping himself on his feet even though he doesnt look like hes the most graceful guy in the world
4032046 but tim has a very good chance of coming out the winner of the match thats what make it a good fight
4032047 i think affliction has right now the best heavyweight division
4032048 the fight card especially for a first time promotion its incredible
4032049 i dont say things because im with some organization now it is the best heavyweight card ive ever seen especially in north america
4032050 the ufc seems to have a lot of problems with different people and organizations and certain fighters
4032051 i happen to fall into that category and so i left them working with tom we worked out an agreement where were both happy
4032052 i have nothing but respect for the ufc but i cant always say they always have the best interest of the sport in mind a lot of times they have the best interest of the ufc in mind and that is their job i dont blame them
4032053 i see the organization going everywhere id like to take it worldwide as well
4032054 but i have a lot of other fighters that im talking to now
4032055 its just a matter of getting the contracts finalized and bringing them on board
4032056 we are not punishing toyota but the end result is we have to try to maintain a competitive balance
4032057 toyota has the newest latest greatest parts and pieces no other company has had new engines in the nationwide or truck series in i dont know how long
4032058 it can be debated whether this is a small or medium change but we felt it was just enough to put toyota back to where everybody was almost on par with the competition
4032059 two vehicles were searched one in which nothing was found and from the other the one of frank schlecks father some products were taken for verification
4032060 it turns out that this was not about forbidden products but medicines that are totally normal to possess
4032061 i dont know what is behind this i think there is something jealousy or something like that
4032062 the customs stopped him and a very good family friend who is often with us
4032063 they can take anything i have no worries about this
4032064 police and customs took me out of my car and asked me if i had products to declare
4032065 they said i had to get out of the car five metres away and put everything out on the street which i had in the back of the car they looked under the seat and after that they found nothing of course and said that i can go on
4032066 could you do this job if you didnt believe in god
4032067 the billfish are incredible wanderers of the open oceans of the world but prefer warmer waters than ours it is just the odd vagrant that strays into our seas and comes to grief they are very unusual and it is a shame that this fish did not go into a national collection such as that of the national museum of wales
4032068 this is just a straggler and probably has nothing to do with climate change but in years to come if the sea temperatures continue to increase they may become commoner around our shores if the stocks have not been fished down to depletion
4032069 i think obviously this helps this just shows were capable of competing from what i understand were aiming for the start of the 2011 season to be in the mls
4032070 theres a lot of talk between the mls and usl and how different the leagues are
4032071 let me tell you the leagues arent all that different the ball is round the game could have gone either way and im just happy to come out with the tie
4032072 what disappoints me is i read one or two of our players talk about montreal playing in a lower league and thats rubbish
4032073 thats absolutely rubbish theyve shown that again although weve taken four points off them theyve gone on to win it
4032074 unless we do something this season is going to peter out
4032075 and i dont want that to happen i think if you look at the starting line up where we have to depend on a 16 year old boy abdus ibrahim as our lead striker that tells you everything
4032076 what i told the players before the game is what would you rather do
4032077 i wasnt sure how well i could do but i knew i was in great shape heading into the race i knew it was going to be a tough race and i had to maintain myself near the leaders to have a chance
4032078 theres a final climb with about five kilometres left and i knew if i got through that i could put myself in position for the sprint
4032079 from then on i just had to position myself well and be aggressive it went really well
4032080 i did play the big points well at the important times i was really able to hang in there and hit my spots
4032081 her serve is better and shes playing faster before she was just running on the baseline
4032082 now shes being more aggressive and stepping in and taking the ball early thats why shes no 2
4032083 just a perfect match for me my coach zeljko krajan said it was the best match i ever played everything worked
4032084 that wasnt me on the court for about five seconds then i was back
4032085 and i think it was because we changed it up a little bit
4032086 i feel it every second of the day im really energized and really excited to be playing volleyball
4032087 the final didnt go exactly as planned i was trying to break a record but unfortunately i had to substitute some of my skills
4032088 i feel sure i will be very strong at the olympic games
4032089 this is my second win in a row here in athens and i am very proud
4032090 i was tired after strong races at the u s champs
4032091 my next race will be in london in beijing i want to win a medal
4032092 getting the olympic gold medal is the most important thing to me because its something you can only do every four years
4032093 i know liu xiang will be difficult to beat the people love him in china and hes a good person
4032094 i train very hard and i hope to stay healthy in order to achieve my goal in beijing i adore athens i run my best races here
4032095 i am very happy i ran my best race over the past two years
4032096 i found my rhythm and i feel great ahead of the beijing games
4032097 i didnt start well but i found my rhythm in the end
4032098 this could not have come at a better time in my career
4032099 my physical condition is perfect and mentally im at peace
4032100 my only wish is to bring the wbc belt back to quebec
4032101 i did really well in the double mini preliminaries and in the finals i just wanted to finish
4032102 i decided to go with a conservative routine in the final
4032103 happy to be here and happy to be in victory lane again this is awesome
4032104 you go to the race track every week thinking youll be a contender you go at least thinking you got a shot at winning
4032105 you keep coming up with ideas from there you go into the race and try to make what you can out of the race
4032106 we made some good calls on adjustments on pit road and the thing came to life
4032107 we got it out front and kind of took off there
4032108 i felt we had something for kyle we just needed a caution
4032109 anything would have worked i was looking all over for debris i just couldnt find anything
4032110 the biggest thing i learned tonight the track didnt change much it got cooler it gained grip and the balance didnt change a whole lot that was pretty cool to see
4032111 the track was well lit by the lights and everything went good hopefully tomorrow we can run on the bottom like we did tonight and get our car handling well as it did tonight and be able to do some of the same things
4032112 the guys were giving me a bit of a hard time and they kept on saying it was my buddies behind the goal who were yelling
4032113 it was amazing its hard to describe sitting on the bench and everybody screaming for you to come on it was something ill always remember
4032114 he just chucked his arm i think after maybe the fifth time the fans started chanting for brennan and he said get on im sick of them now
4032115 i was under a bit of pressure but i handled it
4032116 i really didnt want to upset the back four too early they were pretty solid thats the reason why jimmy came on after 60 minutes
4032117 i was kind of hesitant about whether i should play or not because im so exhausted and my hamstring is a little tight
4032118 i was happy with how i rode and it was an improvement over how the time trial went for me last year
4032119 it was my best performance of the week so im very happy about it
4032120 i could feel the stroke and i was a lot more in control after some heavy training theres always some adaptation at the first meet the morning finals suit me fine i feel i have a lot more energy in the morning
4032121 were in a good position weve really done a great job this weekend
4032122 its been a pretty decent weekend the pace of the car is great i think its a great day to have me and heikki 1 2 its about time we did that
4032123 kovalainen is pushing me hard but thats a good thing
4032124 we didnt seem to be very strong this morning but looking at the lap times from the first two sessions i think we are there
4032125 the lap wasnt perfect the traffic meant i couldnt prepare my tires
4032126 he did a better job but im still in a good position i can imagine tomorrow i think it will be an interesting race
4032127 the car wasnt too bad but i went off and couldnt stay on the circuit
4032128 there is no place for anabolic steroids in competition sports human or equine
4032129 its going to be a different ball game in the future
4032130 you know strategies how they played out today were crazy
4032131 you know when youre racing youre trying to make dives on people that are quite a ways back in the pack people you didnt think youd be racing everybody was making dives it was all going on man i think at some point we were four or five wide going into turn 11
4032132 its not like we dont have a fast car or that were throwing the dice out there
4032133 as far as the championship goes we still want to go out there and win every race
4032134 we still have four races to go and a 65 point lead its not that big really when you get 50 points for a win and maybe three for most laps led
4032135 weve got a lot of work ahead of us consistent finishes is going to be tough but if we can go out and get another race win or another two that would definitely put the nail in the coffin
4032136 it was just unfortunate so difficult to get out of the pits and especially for me to go around the cars in front
4032137 but you know theyre saving fuel they dont have much to lose i just followed what else could i do
4032138 i made sure at certain parts of the track i had enough of a run to make sure he couldnt make a big dive i just sort of raced my race looking in the mirrors
4032139 i missed the first stop in baltimore because of an injury
4032140 i just wanted to come out and put something down and it happened i havent been skating my best lately but everything clicked for me today
4032141 the jam for me is usually where im a little better because i dont have to have the pressure of landing everything first
4032142 i can do more difficult tricks and have a couple tries to do it
4032143 to play for argentina you have to be 100 per cent physically and mentally
4032144 it would have been disrespectful to the shirt to carry on
4032145 there are a lot of drivers in the running right now
4032146 its not narrowed down to just one driver right now
4032147 we definitely want somebody that you feel like is dedicated to what were trying to do and realizing that were taking an organization thats not had the success that it wants and has the foresight to look forward and see what were trying to accomplish
4032148 you want a driver that has that same attitude with what they do every weekend
4032149 the stats speak for themselves but going back to 2003 we were a dominant race team eight wins 14 poles
4032150 thats awesome and we have been dominant we just arent dominant right now and that cycles
4032151 roger penske always says it says right on his website effort equals results if youre not getting your results then you question the effort
4032152 maybe its like being in high school and having a bunch of girls and if you get an opportunity to date one or the other and you dont know the timeline of how everythings going to go you dont know when youre going to get a date
4032153 my team did a fantastic job we were struggling at the start of the weekend we were at best about 11th to come through and win here was definitely not what we expected
4032154 id like to thank everybody on the target team you guys nailed that pit stop and we got the lead and were unstoppable
4032155 what am i going to say i just have to laugh i guess i really tried
4032156 i was doing everything i could to push dixon and put on the pressure to the point that my tires just gave out when i was at the braking point at the turn i just went straight
4032157 man i wanted to win that race so bad but hey it is what it is and well move forward
4032158 it was a very eventful race there was lots happening and you were never sure what strategy people were on
4032159 it was always mixing up the field and making it difficult for the guys like myself that were pushing to try and get to the podium
4032160 i think it shows we deserve to be out here
4032161 i lost radio communication with my crew around lap 34 which was very frustrating so i just followed the cars in front of me
4032162 i am frustrated that i finished 18th because the motorola car was capable of a top 10 finish
4032163 i came in really feeling strong the last few miles and that is a good sign for me leading into beijing
4032164 this was a great last test for the olympics perfect for me i am really thrilled with this
4032165 the trip was getting to him and i got into him pretty good
4032166 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
4032167 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
4032168 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
4032169 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
4032170 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
4032171 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
4032172 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
4032173 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
4032174 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
4032175 my first advice to them is youre not a trained diver like they are
4032176 so first and foremost if youre going to enter the water enter the water feet first thats the safest way to get into any kind of water even if its somewhere youve swam several times
4032177 often youve misjudged the depth of the water or you forget that things do change especially in a lake or a river or an open body of water where the bottom will change and where hazards will float through as a result of currents
4032178 we encourage people to go out and be healthy and active and hopefully safe while youre doing these activities
4032179 one of the things i remembered from when i was about 13 is i watched my first olympics and it was mexico city in 68 and it really had a profound effect on me
4032180 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted as five or 10 individual privately held units
4032181 the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
4032182 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4032183 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4032184 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds
4032185 we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
4032186 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
4032187 inici un proceso de genocidio basado en las informaciones de las acciones cometidas por las tropas georgianas dirigidas a asesinar a ciudadanos rusos que viven en osetia del sur
4032188 we want consumers to be aware of the potential risk of injury and to contact us though only a small portion of decking sold has been affected by these issues we urge people who bought or installed these composite decking products after january 1 2005 to contact us for an inspection through our decking notice web site or customer service line
4032189 it just made him realize that he has to get back into training a little bit he wants to put in a full week of training hes been able to train fully but to do paris would interrupt training too much
4032190 i think having company now in that 9 7 range actually takes pressure off of him powell
4032191 everyone has been expecting him to break the world record every time out and win every race
4032192 hes training hard and fully expects to get his world record back at some stage i think its exciting for the sport these guys to be racing each other and put up these fast times
4032193 we have been studying ways to make volleyball more attractive to the public with more rallies the game would become more interesting
4032194 we will decide in september whether to decrease ball pressure a little
4032195 he represented himself and his country to the highest degree of class dignity and character i am so proud of all he did for japanese players
4032196 but he still had the motivation to pitch so we were more than willing to give him an opportunity
4032197 if he hadnt hurt his groin who knows what he might have accomplished with us this year
4032198 nobody alive today can throw a no hitter in colorado and he did he won the rookie of the year and helped the dodgers win the division in 1996 i know he will be inducted into the japanese hall of fame and certainly hope he is inducted into the national baseball hall of fame he is a pioneer and he deserves all the recognition in the world
4032199 those numbers were attained in california and new york the a league so i am proud of that
4032200 my understanding is they had to remove on the left side a part of his cranium to get the swelling down
4032201 but the doctor from what ive gathered from donna was optimistic
4032202 ems reacted so quickly and got him to the trauma center so fast that that really gave him a fighting chance
4032203 i started very fast and tried to keep the gap but also had to be very careful i fell last weekend and i didnt want to do it again i was feeling very good on the climbs way better than the nationals last week it was a perfect race for me
4032204 we had a good race in the final we stayed in our boat and just listened to mark telling us what was happening and just followed the race plan the whole way down
4032205 they have raced well throughout the regatta and were able to make the changes required each time to have their best race
4032206 i was trying to protect the whole game the integrity of the game
4032207 the wnba is very special to me because i have four daughters i dont even raise my hand to them and i would never push a woman this game i love this game too much
4032208 rick mahorn is known as a peacemaker from even the brawl we had here with indiana
4032209 he went out there to get people off the pile and to get people to stop the confrontation thats who he is thats what he does
4032210 i think rick was trying to play peacemaker but hes just too big
4032211 i was only trying to grab my players and i didnt see exactly what happened but he apparently gently tried to push lisa away
4032212 that was unfortunate but things like that happen in basketball sometimes
4032213 the league is going to have to decide what kind of action to take
4032214 im glad that none of our players got hurt and i hope that cheryl is ok
4032215 this was a game we needed badly and we won it
4032216 thats the important part despite what happened at the end
4032217 youre going to be down after losing two games in a row at home especially emotional last minute games and then throw fords injury on top of that
4032218 im sure well get a suspension or two here and there we cant get the olympic break fast enough
4032219 i havent seen something like that i dont think in my whole career
4032220 i just wanted to come out here and make a statement
4032221 i did that today i just got to keep running like i did today and hopefully in the olympics ill come out on top
4032222 everything is flowing my finish is strong it is a great time
4032223 now i got to go to stockholm hopefully get another great race and go home and train hard
4032224 the time is pretty perfect i love to run in paris in beijing i will take the races one by one until the final
4032225 it was a test before the olympic games and im very happy to have succeeded
4032226 i would say no 35 weeks a year is a gruelling schedule
4032227 to be honest i think the nationwide schedule is tougher than the sprint cup series schedule so you know it presents its own set of challenges and you know my life right now is racing
4032228 there are times when you sit back and you think and you go wow this has really been a dream season really been a great year so far
4032229 just the past 12 months a lot of good things have happened to me and ive been very fortunate
4032230 the performance has been of such success to where it was somewhat surprising
4032231 but those issues are out of my hands and there wasnt much i could do about it so thats just the way it goes life goes on
4032232 but i know driving for jr motorsports is locked in stone and look forward to that
4032233 going to daytona he helped me out a tremendous amount watching footage from talladega and showing me what i did wrong and what i did right and trying to explain that to me
4032234 so its just the small things like that that seem to help me out a lot
4032235 you know when it comes down to the responsibilities to the sponsors and to the fans and how to balance all that and how to live your own life its a constant juggling act
4032236 theres no right or wrong on it but its trying to find that right balance and that right harmony
4032237 the road course races you know we need to just survive them and try not to lose any points to clint
4032238 the chase is great but i also respect the fact that it takes a whole season to determine a champion
4032239 i really feel like we have a shot at running for the title
4032240 so were excited about it were excited to see what the future will hold
4032241 a lot of people have a lot of things to say
4032242 i knew what i wanted to do when i went into that fight and i was able to come out on top
4032243 i try to stay focused and i dont like to listen to a lot of the stuff im there to do what i need to do and all the rest is just noise
4032244 i took a long hard look at it with my wife and said you know i can only really fight for a few years
4032245 a fights a fight whether its front of five million people on national tv or six to eight thousand people in a local venue im still stepping into that cage to do what ive trained to do
4032246 anthony johnson is extremely explosive i think if he has it his way he would like to stand and trade more in a brawling type situation and strike more than he would go to the ground styles make fights and i think its going to shape up for a pretty interesting fight for the fans i really do
4032247 i honestly see myself winning the fight whether its on my feet or on the ground
4032248 im an all or nothing kind of guy im in or not
4032249 it took really three years which was probably a blessing in disguise because i was able to get a really solid ground base of skills in jiu jitsu and wrestling to match up the striking skills that i had
4032250 to quiet the noise she said you can do it just this once
4032251 afterwards she was like oh im so glad its over
4032252 i was so weak it was bad it was really bad
4032253 obviously the better you are the more people are going to listen thats the way the world is
4032254 at the same time if i wasnt doing well id still be talking about what gods done in my life
4032255 for some reason god allowed my heart to open up that night and see my grandmothers eyes cry and see that in her face thats what it took
4032256 where im coming from is no different than a lot of people that have gone through the same struggles
4032257 its just that ive got the platform to be able to share what ive been through and how god brought me through it to hopefully inspire people that are going through the same things
4032258 after my message i got an e mail from a guy who just hearing that message really confronted his own addiction and how hes getting help he came clean with his family and is now on his own road to recovery
4032259 hes very strongly committed to sharing his word with people but he has to do it around the other demands on his time and his schedule so its a balancing act
4032260 dude i got to give you props single handedly you made soccer in america this much more popular
4032261 i call it soccer because in america we already have a game dudes play called football
4032262 theres mornings i wake up and i feel like calling the giants especially after watching brett and saying if its not going to be a big deal like the brett favre situation id like to come back
4032263 were having a controversy in new york i want my position back the gap attack is back
4032264 i grew up playing soccer so i love david beckham i was thinking dont trip dont trip hes truly an inspiration
4032265 so many times people have tried to split mr smith and i up
4032266 none of those snipes will ever ever erase the history that mr smith and i have we are one and we will continue to be one
4032267 the important thing about carlos and smith is the issues are the same about human rights
4032268 i had to persevere from this injury it was tough and im real nervous right now
4032269 im real happy i can be here standing before everybody jimmy v said never give up thats the main thing i told myself every day lying in the hospital bed

4032276 usa judo in 1982 and 1983 did do their due dilligence and they gave everybody the opportunity to stand up there is an appeals process
4032277 i will do everything in my power to restore my reputation
4032278 integrity is compromised in any way the entire sport is compromised
4032279 it is undisputed that donaghy dishonestly refereed 16 games during the 2006 2007 season and a corresponding portion of his compensation for these games is an appropriate measure of the nbas loss
4032280 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4032281 it was a great match but our opponents were very strong and we could not equal their play
4032282 the dominicans hit the ball very hard and their defence was strong while our errors on both defence and offence put to us in trouble
4032283 this track has so much history and its cool to win at a track where a lot of the greats have competed
4032284 he made a big move today and just coasted home you can drive him with two fingers
4032285 the match was a challenge as many players on the court had not played much thus far
4032286 it was great to see them step in and play relaxed and with a lot of heart even when our opposition presented them with a challenge
4032287 he was asked to go back to the bathroom to put his clothes on and he did and went back to his seat and then allegedly attempted to open an aircraft emergency exit door
4032288 members of the major league soccer team the new england revolution were on the flight they were able to subdue him
4032289 we had a good race today we got off the line cleanly and were able to find a strong consistent rhythm through the middle thousand of 2000 metres
4032290 its going to be a tough final on sunday and were hoping to be able to continue to execute our race plan as well as we have done to this point
4032291 its cold for me i definitely prefer to run in warmer weather
4032292 but bolt is very talented hes the favourite hes a cool person we were friends even before the world record so nothing has changed
4032293 i had some flashbacks because ive been injured before but it wasnt serious enough from stopping me train
4032294 my start and my first 35 metres if there are any improvements to make its there
4032295 i ran in a relay two years ago but this is my first individual race here
4032296 the way i am running at the moment i feel i am in the best shape i have been in
4032297 there are a lot of people running fast at the moment and i dont see any one athlete as being my main competitor
4032298 the race did not quite go as expected but felt easy
4032299 a bit more work to do and everything should be fine for beijing
4032300 i really felt i could jump a world record today
4032301 ive got one more competition then a rest for two weeks before beijing
4032302 its going to be a hard competition and it might be necessary to break a world record to win
4032303 it started off pretty good but at the end i think i was trying too hard and i didnt go with what i had been working on in practice
4032304 my preparations are going really well so im really disappointed in todays performance
4032305 to get a win so close to the olympics is very good psychologically
4032306 im going to make sure i dont lose again because if i lose the next one it means i lose gold
4032307 i cant afford to lose the one thats coming up the olympics
4032308 i am feeling very confident my chances are as good as anyone else
4032309 ive got two weeks training now and i am feeling in great shape
4032310 the distances werent there tonight but the win will give me a lot of confidence for beijing
4032311 the fact that you had a canadian on the 100th anniversary and that he played so well on a golf course that arguably he may not have liked himself made it special
4032312 it was a place to be on the weekend here as he built himself up and got into that final group on sunday
4032313 i know how hard it is to win at home especially with the crowd as vocal as what they were out there
4032314 towards the end they were really cheering for mike i hope they didnt get to him but in my mind they must have affected him one way or the other
4032315 with the world cup of hockey being in town there was a lot of red and white being waved around
4032316 it was a great experience i would have loved to have won
4032317 i think if you have a long career everybody is going to have a tough loss here or there
4032318 this is a tough one no doubt about it but ill be back
4032319 you see paramedics running into the stands just when you think it ends there is another group trying to fight print
4032320 i had a good hold and she was responding to me
4032321 i came out here with a plan and i did execute that well
4032322 my coach no doubt will tell me what i did wrong i just came here to work on my 200 and i did just that today
4032323 im still not sure about beijing im still waiting to see whats going on
4032324 id definitely like to double i think i could do well in both
4032325 im just looking for consistency and to do what my coach says
4032326 with that throw and my long jump yesterday it has been an encouraging weekend
4032327 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
4032328 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
4032329 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
4032330 i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
4032331 and i like what i do so i just play im not sure that im going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then im going to re evaluate and see but im getting close
4032332 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
4032333 i dont know what to do its so disappointing that i cant post something low it seems like i cant play 18 holes
4032334 on the 17th tee i got really mad a bad drive off the tee and i didnt hit a good chip
4032335 but the rest i have no complaints i think the first day im not worried
4032336 ich habe bronze gewonnen nicht gold oder silber verloren ich wollte bei meinen ersten spielen unbedingt eine medaille jetzt bin ich super happy dass es geklappt hat
4032337 geef een idioot een uniform en hij denkt baas van de wereld te zijn
4032338 oei oei ik ga moeten bijbetalen als ik nog veel doe nu
4032339 we knew he would get beaten they all get beaten the horse raced great
4032340 i feel mixed emotions because he is a great colt
4032341 but i had to do my job and the value of my colt just skyrocketed
4032342 i mean i just took my shot at the half
4032343 i thought those two horses were chewed up at the half after 51 and a piece
4032344 i just wasnt sure how much the other horse had left in his tank
4032345 i have to give art official all the credit in the world
4032346 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
4032347 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
4032348 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
4032349 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
4032350 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
4032351 it just didnt come to me you know im just not on top of things like that i guess i should have said something to mike its just so unimportant to me i just dont get it
4032352 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
4032353 we are very excited to see him come into the race the right way we could not be happier with the way he is doing i think he is a horse that has captured the imagination of racing and to see him perform so poorly in the belmont was so disappointing to the horse
4032354 if men and women are stuck in a committed relationship which is set for the moment and no one questions it how can they find love happiness and fulfillment in the hearts and how can both partners find a satisfying sexuality
4032355 it ss like squaring the circle how can there be fulfilment without love
4032356 basically the ego of man and the bourgeois love are monsters in the service of the management of property
4032357 let us have a look at these feelings the true feelings of the moment
4032358 fasting is an act of deep personal worship to god in which muslims seek to raise their level of god consciousness the act of fasting redirects the heart away from worldly activities and towards the remembrance of god the self restraint of ramadan make the heart and mind accustomed to the remembrance and praise of god and to the obedience of his commandments muslims focus during this month on strengthening their relationship with the creator
4032359 he who does not desist from obscene language and acting obscenely during the period of fasting allah has no need that he does not eat or drink
4032360 fasting is not only from food and drink fasting is to refrain from obscene acts
4032361 ramadan is a time for spiritual reflection prayer and doing of good deeds fasting is intended to inculcate self discipline self restraint and generosity
4032362 indeed anyone who fasts for one day for allahs pleasure allah will keep his face away from the hell fire for a distance covered by a journey of seventy years
4032363 the sleep of a fasting person is regarded as an act of worship his remaining silent is regarded as glorifying god the reward for his good deeds is multiplied his supplications are accepted and his sins are forgiven
4032364 we realize that theres more and more demands in this business at this level
4032365 in order to get the job done you need many people doing it so its really as simple as that
4032366 in my estimation and many people in hockey feel the same way steves the strongest candidate in hockey at the executive level who wasnt a general manager
4032367 perhaps a little more at 10 000 feet than day to day
4032368 this guy lowe isnt going anywhere and i dont want him to go anywhere
4032369 were going to work hard as a management team and come up with solutions in how we go forward
4032370 i do know that there is a tremendous amount of potential from our young players
4032371 there are some highly skilled young players here and with some character veterans such as ethan moreau shawn horcoff and steve staois this is an exciting team
4032372 on behalf of the entire canucks organization we would like to thank steve for his many contributions to our club as a player and manager over nearly 20 years
4032373 we just didnt see that late kick from him today
4032374 i dont know if that was because he is still getting used to the turf or what my feeling right now is that he needs another turf test we know what he can do on dirt and that is always an option
4032375 he hasnt been given the kudos he deserves since winning the breeders cup
4032376 today he confirmed he is one of the best middle distance turf horses in the world and has been for the last two three years
4032377 i felt like somebody had hit me over the head with a club
4032378 i had three horses in the first day three on the second day when he made that announcement i thought i had lost everything
4032379 it shows the gross injustice of the allotment and horsemen are finally feeling that weve got to do something to resolve the matter
4032380 we recognized that this was going to be a difficult struggle
4032381 weve heard racetracks and others in the industry saying for a long time that the economic model was broke but it appeared to just be rhetoric
4032382 the judge even though he ruled against me told me the horsemens decision was cutting off their nose to spite their face
4032383 i see horsemen not being able to pay their feed bills
4032384 what happened is this has gotten so dag gone complicated i think they realized they had to work together weve got to get this thing fixed
4032385 from our perspective what churchill downs and twin spires is trying to do is grow the business and attract new customers
4032386 thats what we should all be talking about instead were talking about how were dividing up a diminishing pile of money
4032387 im taking a one year sacrifice its a dice roll on my part

4032402 i was feeling pretty nervous but that didnt affect my diving in the final
4032403 i really didnt miss anything so i was very happy with that my twister was great and my front three and a half as well those dives have been going well for me all week and they just went down the best today
4032404 i wasnt expecting to do that well my optionals havent been going very well lately but i just went all out today and didnt hold anything back i really wanted to make the world junior team
4032405 when we heard about the results of the x rays the decision was easy
4032406 it went really well we went through five rounds and i made sure i stayed on my board each time did my tricks and had a lot of fun
4032407 im really looking forward to the rest of the season
4032408 the injuries set me back a bit but at the same time ive gained experience and i think thats whats making the big difference this year for me
4032409 he banged the victims head into the ground several times until his helmet was crushed he then kicked him in the face the victim became disoriented
4032410 but after a lot of thinking and discussions we all feel it is in our best interest to close the spectrum
4032411 its something weve been reluctant to do but at this point i think the building has seen its best days
4032412 the prosecution is sending a warning that while some things might be tolerated in sports other actions wont be tolerated
4032413 but the crown is saying this level of violence is considered reprehensible and prohibited on or off the ice and there are norms that shouldnt be surpassed
4032414 im getting ready for next season and if i have to testify ill go testify
4032415 it was a nil wind reading so if i had a plus one i would have run even faster
4032416 of course there is still a lot of room for improvement
4032417 im not as strong as i should be so im still working on my strength
4032418 going into beijing i feel very good very fresh im definitely in world record shape
4032419 im in the form that i must keep until the games
4032420 i hoped to break a world record here in my hometown and its the first competition since i moved to monaco
4032421 the jamaican team speaks for itself the plan in beijing is to go 1 2 3
4032422 i won relaxed and im happy about it its good for the future
4032423 im on the way i hope ill do better in beijing
4032424 it will be necessary to jump more than seven metres to have a medal
4032425 he was feeling really good and he felt he was ready to run a canadian record for the last while
4032426 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
4032427 that is a factor and will always be a factor for me
4032428 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
4032429 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
4032430 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
4032431 i think he was just a little bit surprised maybe but i think he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it
4032432 i think he agreed its a very good opportunity for him and the club obviously wanted him and pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
4032433 i dont know if we were going to move him up or down but well start there

4032439 right now we have an enormous opportunity to create a new green economy

4032442 the diverse backgrounds and expertise of our members has allowed the commission to come up with a far reaching plan that hits on several important areas
4032443 the goal of all of the events and activities we have planned is to engage the public in a lively and thought provoking discussion about the significance of statehood
4032444 im proud of the plan the commission has developed to commemorate this anniversary

4032455 connecticut is a national leader in promoting clean energy in a way that makes sense and this exciting innovative program proves that once again
4032456 with the national economy in a slump with energy prices at frankly ridiculous highs and other prices including food prices headed for the sky our families are looking for alternatives
4032457 by creating more opportunities for renewable energy sources we can assist individuals reduce energy costs improve air quality and reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil
4032458 programs such as this are a key component of my agenda to keep connecticut a leader in sustainability
4032459 this program is the latest initiative by ccef to make clean renewable energy accessible to connecticuts families
4032460 by combining ccefs solar rebate program with the financial power of leasing we have created an affordable way for connecticut homeowners to adopt solar energy without the high upfront cost
4032461 ct solar lease will be an exciting addition to u s bancorps growing portfolio of renewable energy investments
4032462 the significant equity generated by the federal investment tax credits and ccefs forwarding thinking rebate program are the keys to achieving a cost effective way for homeowners to benefit from clean solar powered electricity
4032463 we are very excited to work with solar contractors and homeowners in implementing ct solar lease
4032464 our experience in energy lending shows that consumers appreciate a simple financing option with low fixed monthly payments that can be offset by their energy savings ct solar lease not only provides extremely low payments but eliminates the down payment entirely a real win win for connecticut homeowners
4032465 this program is innovative in its use of commercial solar tax credits not currently available to connecticut homeowners for the installation of solar electric generating systems
4032466 we are confident that ct solar lease will provide the most affordable and cost effective solution for moderate to low income connecticut homeowners

4032471 it is an important next step to extending space access to commercial defense security and science initiatives
4032472 in tough economic times it is important that we do not sit idly by but that we invest wisely in economic opportunities for the future
4032473 as i made clear in calling for the special session the budget surplus regardless of the amount should be used solely for home heating assistance for our families this winter
4032474 the general assembly can and should approve my proposals during the august 22 session to delay this action for any reason will hurt connecticut families who will need help this winter more than ever before
4032475 i am pleased that senator don williams agrees with me on the need to expand assistance to connecticut families who will face unprecedented home heating costs
4032476 my budget office agrees that the budget surplus has grown to approximately 85 million and that is good news because we will need every penny of that surplus to help thousands of families to heat their homes
4032477 we will have families who never before sought heating assistance asking for help this winter
4032478 families that in years past have been donors to organizations such as operation fuel will themselves find the combination of heating costs gasoline costs and food costs not to mention other expenses pushing their budgets to the breaking point and beyond accordingly the need for the legislature to take action also has never been greater
4032479 action before september 1 is critically important because we cannot allow the budget surplus to be rolled into the rainy day fund
4032480 if the budget surplus goes into the rainy day fund additional action by the legislature would be required to spend it for energy programs and we need these funds to be in place to help people before the arrival of the winter heating season which is fast approaching
4032481 the rainy day fund is the states nest egg but too many lawmakers view it as a candy store for their pet projects
4032482 i will not permit them to use rainy day funds to satisfy their uncontrollable spending appetites our rainy day fund has a healthy balance of more than 1 3 billion but we will need that money next year in the event of a budget deficit
4032483 with the national political conventions and the start of school dominating the last couple weeks of august lawmakers need to focus on our families and their heating needs now
4032484 the legislature should complete this important work on august 22nd and provide energy assistance and peace of mind to thousands of connecticut families
4032485 the ripple of effect of high fuel prices is having a tremendous impact on everyone
4032486 it is likely that half of the 549 fuel oil dealers in connecticut will need some assistance to buy their home heating oil from wholesalers most of these dealers are small companies with less than five trucks
4032487 we want to ensure that dealers can provide uninterrupted reliable service to the thousands of connecticut households
4032488 with heating oil expected in the 5 a gallon range this is just one of many steps we are taking to ease the economic burden that is bearing down on connecticut families and businesses this winter
4032489 the two boxes from daewoo that were affected were made before the digital tick logo that set a standard for digital tv
4032490 i am angry about the lack of publicity and consultation about this change which affects so many people
4032491 durch die derzeitige wirtschaftliche schw chephase ist in deutschland so mancher wirtschaftszweig zunehmend unter druck geraten
4032492 die video und dvd branche bildet in dieser hinsicht eine ausnahme hier konnte das gute umsatzergebnis aus dem vorjahr gehalten werden
4032493 unsere blu ray umsatzprognosen von 50 bis 60 millionen euro bis ende dieses jahres scheinen sich offensichtlich zu bewahrheiten der erzielte umsatz in diesem bereich konnte den leichten r ckgang bei den dvd verk ufen auffangen
4032494 der abw rtstrend beim verleih konnte zwar etwas abgeschw cht werden setzt sich aber dennoch fort
4032495 der verleih bereich leidet schon seit jahren unter der fortschreitenden online piraterie der wirtschaftliche schaden der dadurch entsteht ist nur schwer abzusch tzen

4032497 we are spending more and more time with our communications devices but spending less on them
4032498 our devotion to watching listening and staying in touch wherever and whenever we want shows no sign of diminishing and with healthy competition overall prices offer increasing value for money
4032499 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4032500 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4032501 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4032502 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4032503 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4032504 i think the administration has most of what they need
4032505 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly

4032511 we have some fairly good new information we believe we know who may be involved in the incident
4032512 the agricultural teachers own pet rabbit wilma was kept in the yard and she had her unborn babies cut out of her belly i cant believe there are such sickos living in our community
4032513 for these animals to have suffered and been tortured and dismembered it is like something out of a horror movie
4032514 they were basically mutilated and spread around in the compound where the animals are
4032515 obviously the college community is disgusted and disappointed at whats happened anybody who can take advantage of defenceless animals that are being cared for by our students is quite disappointing
4032516 corporal adam mckiski and corporal stewart trejo are true patriots who fought proudly and bravely for their fellow citizens and for the ideals of this country californians will never forget their courage and sacrifice maria and i send our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of these brave men during this difficult time
4032517 private first class jennifer cole fought with pride honor and unyielding commitment to freedom and democracy her courage is an inspiration to all californians and we will never forget her sacrifice maria and i send our condolences to jennifers family and friends
4032518 maria and i are deeply saddened by the loss of private jair de jesus garcia jair de jesus was a brave soldier who fought courageously in defense of our nations freedom his sacrifice service and loyalty to our country will never be forgotten we join all californians in offering our thoughts and prayers to jair de jesus family and friends during this difficult time
4032519 it now features a unique red led embedded into the thinkpad signature replacing the typical red dot over the letter i when powered up it glows constantly reminding everyone who has the thinkpad in the room it also cleverly communicates overall system status when the lid is closed and the thinkpad goes into standby the led begins to slowly pulse like a human heart we spent a lot of time on this feature working with both development and marketing its not easy squeezing a led into the display cover in the end i think it adds value and richens the brand experience
4032520 true thinkpad is always noticed with or without a red led i can spot a thinkpad in an airport lounge or a conference room from quite a distance instantly the r61i e are not systems i would choose but they are still distinctly thinkpads this is another example of lenovo marketing simply not understanding their own brand just like the lenovo logo on the lids
4032521 we will get rid off the legendary thinkpad name from this computer and in the future we will never consider any other compromise with thinkpad core values the thinkpad name will be removed from this model and the notebook will be renamed as the new lenovo sm series model redesigning it according to lenovo notebooks standarts and will continue selling by the new name
4032522 estoy muy contento con el equipo est trabajando bien y va a dar un buen nivel de juego en portugal los jugadores est n a un nivel muy alto en los entrenamientos que estamos desarrollando en la pretemporada pero siempre es bueno ver en estos partidos como est n f sicamente y sobre todo ante rivales que no estamos acostumbrados a enfrentarnos y eso te da pie a probar cosas nuevas
4032523 i dont think its within their authority to do so because right now the execution is under the authority of the office to do it
4032524 so it is up to them whether or not they do it but i believe they should respect this court and they should respect the constitution
4032525 otherwise we will assume that they are disrespectful of the national constitution
4032526 this means that the law admits that the prisoner may still be alive after he has already been shot and certainly blood will be all over him so that he will undergo a very deep torture before he finally dies by the final shot
4032527 wir haben davon profitiert dass russland im halbfinale der em war und zum gro teil die spiele in sterreich absolviert hat

4032529 the one thing i did just mention to graeme swann is that if it does rain all day today and maybe a bit tomorrow when the covers come off it might seam a little bit
4032530 i just thought i should warn him swann its not been a doctored pitch but it may just seam around
4032531 games have been finished in nearly two days here when the weather is like this it can be difficult to bat on
4032532 we have two good sides and two good bowling attacks so we have to be ready to play some cricket

4032537 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
4032538 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
4032539 its not fair its elitist and they need to practice what theyre preaching
4032540 beberapa hari yang ditentukan itu ialah bulan ramadan bulan yang di dalamnya diturunkan permulaan al quran sebagai petunjuk bagi manusia dan penjelasan penjelasan mengenai petunjuk itu dan pembeda antara yang hak dan yang batil

4032543 you men have much thicker skin than us you bastards never age even shaving keeps you younger and dont even think about complaining when you get older i mean how come men are always rugged and distinguished when women are called haggard and grey i hate you all
4032544 ooh is that firming cream on your moobs or are you just pleased to see me
4032545 we have a laid back atmosphere where everybody knows everybody when one hurts we all hurt we reach down and pick them up
4032546 this is a friendly town if god keeps blessing us were going to be all right
4032547 this isnt one of the affluent neighborhoods this is an old neighborhood its truly diverse but it is somewhat of a transient neighborhood too with a lot of rental property
4032548 i didnt like the idea of someone being so close to my house looking for opportunities to steal
4032549 every police department wishes for residents like her it makes our job that much easier
4032550 so far we havent seen any young people at the meetings but they are so busy
4032551 these kids dont have anything to do but get into trouble and thats a shame when we have a beautiful boys and girls club two blocks away
4032552 the crimes being committed are not done by out of towners or strangers our neighbors are hurting each other we are doing this to ourselves
4032553 i think this idea of neighbors knowing neighbors and promoting our neighborhood is a good thing for us its good to know who belongs here and who doesnt
4032554 it gives us confidence to question why people are coming out of a house with furniture a lot of peoplewouldnt get involved
4032555 these people are better than the fbi and the cia combined
4032556 seriously they have the scoop on everything going on and who is doing what thats why i wanted them to be involved in this neighborhood watch they are already good neighbors in the complex i wanted them to spread out and keep an eye out for the other neighbors surrounding us
4032557 this makes me feel safer knowing i have neighbors like this
4032558 my mom and dad have both passed away but i have lots of cousins and my aunt lives in these apartments this is my family
4032559 over the years there had been a few break ins in our neighborhood
4032560 and when one of our neighbors was on vacation a while back their home wascompletely undone they lost everything of value but on the whole this is a pretty quiet place to live
4032561 remember if you see or hear anything unusual call the police
4032562 she told me to live in my house and enjoy it
4032563 when grandma got to where she couldnt take care of herself we got her in to village park they took good care of her and she loved it there
4032564 the rain actually helped things along because it wasnt too hot we were done in about six hours
4032565 im thrilled with the way the project turned out its more than i could have imagined they worked in the pouring rain for us
4032566 mary vann was just a little sweetheart she wouldve just loved it
4032567 i thought she was a good lady i think its a great project she would have liked it
4032568 budgetwise it would not of have been possible for us to do this type of project
4032569 they had a couple of plastic chairs out in front of the building this gives them a nice seating area including a little kids bench where they can sit outside visit with their families and enjoy the fountain grandmaloved to garden and be outside so i think shed really like what we did
4032570 we would love to have some local companies donate prizes for bingo
4032571 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4032572 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4032573 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
4032574 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4032575 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4032576 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
4032577 i did tell eric on the phone the day before i came up i said hey i want to play as soon as possible
4032578 i wouldve played three plays the other night at cleveland but that wouldve been ugly i dont know i think well just play it by ear
4032579 you cant afford to do that during the season so i hope that were getting that out of our system now those were my fault i overthrew one underthrew another one i think thats where a week from now well be much better
4032580 there is intentional vandalism on the butte and theres inadvertent vandalism
4032581 many of the people who hike up on the butte arent tuned in to the fact that those petroglyphs are there
4032582 they climb and walk on them and sit on them but there are some who maybe add their own initials and all those things have an impact on the rock art
4032583 historic designation brings community attention to a property and says special considerations may be appropriate here
4032584 we would use the funds to clean up some of the rock art damaged by paint
4032585 we also could put up some signage educating the public about the significance of the property and we could increase patrols by park rangers
4032586 once the petroglyphs are gone we can never get them back people need to understand what they are their antiquity their importance to us all
4032587 the petroglyphs are the physical remains of the hohokam culture the first people to inhabit the valley
4032588 they excavated hundreds of miles of irrigation canals and created the largest irrigation system in north america they pioneered successful agriculture in the valley
4032589 theres big money and theres big interest here and theres a reason
4032590 the desire to fund an opposition candidate speaks to a desire for change it suggests there are high stakes that concern law enforcement and the oversight of prosecution
4032591 it could be a reflection of some uncertainty about what the incumbent has done some concern with his ties to the sheriff joe arpaio who shares similar hard line views on illegal immigration and various hiring practices for private attorneys theres been enough questions about how hes run the office this would encourage people to contribute money
4032592 outsourcing may be a fact of life but the question is is the money buying influence or is the money buying access those are difficult allegations to prove
4032593 we have now a political patronage system rather than a justice system
4032594 when you control that spending we need to make sure that a few outside counsel we do hire are hired on the basis of merit not based on their campaign contributions
4032595 there has never ever been a candidate for the top prosecutors job in maricopa county that has stepped up to the counter of the criminal defense attorneys like he has he has a lot of explaining to do
4032596 ive gotten contributions from all segments of the bar including prosecutors and civil lawyers and lawyers of all stripes
4032597 people know that im committed to putting public safety first and to improving our justice system
4032598 there is no reasonable likelihood of conviction based on the information contained in the department reports
4032599 this process is reserved for more complicated cases in which more evidence is needed or existing evidence requires further review
4032600 use a much higher standard than the police use to determine their stand
4032601 we said what can we do its a really good case i disagreed with the turn down because its a solid case that stems from domestic violence and it has a high potential of repetitive behavior the victims are extremely concerned that hes been let out
4032602 he martin said if i ever meet you face to face im gonna kill you
4032603 im really frustrated and disgusted at the system right now
4032604 i feel like a dog has more rights than i do now
4032605 the march of islam through russia the return of islam to andalusia and a victory parade in jerusalem with liberated saddam hussein at the lead this will follow after a war in syria and the assassination of king abdullah of jordan
4032606 i know its going to be crazy but i know i will love them
4032607 she started the ultrasound and then she said you are having twins
4032608 then she kept looking and she went and got the doctor i started to get nervous

4032611 wie nie zuvor sind wir f r eine vielzahl von unternehmen gerade damit befasst einerseits das pricing zu optimieren andererseits aber auch die markenst rke auszubauen auf der marktseite der unternehmen sind dies gerade absolute kernthemen
4032612 marke als dominierendes bewusstes entscheidungskriterium hat in nur f nf jahren quer durch alle branchen dramatisch abgenommen
4032613 es berrascht dass die verbraucher selbst bei den eher emotional gekauften modeartikeln immer st rker auf den preis achten
4032614 in besonders hart umk mpften branchen zeigt sich wohin die reise nun auch in anderen m rkten geht beim flugverkehr bei kaffee banken oder telekommunikation berall verlieren diejenigen markenanbieter an boden die sowohl das eigentliche pricing als auch ihre preiskommunikation nicht im griff haben
4032615 wurde fr her berwiegend der markenname als dominierendes kaufkriterium genannt so ist heute immer fter der preis der wichtigste faktor im bewusstsein der menschen
4032616 auch die lufthansa zeigt dass erfolg auch im wettbewerb mit billiganbietern m glich ist verbraucher honorieren es sofort wenn die richtigen tasten auf der marketing klaviatur gegriffen werden und die zielgruppenbezogene preiskommunikation stimmt
4032617 erstens sind markenanbieter damit konfrontiert dass sich neue zielgruppen st rker ber werte und bed rfniswelten bilden und nicht mehr nur ber demografische faktoren wie die h he des einkommens oder das alter
4032618 m ssen neue preismodelle die werte und einstellungen dieser neuen zielgruppen wesentlich intelligenter ansprechen als bisher markenhersteller die ihre preiskommunikation und ihr markenmanagement schlau verbinden werden sich in diesem trend behaupten k nnen

4032639 alexander called me on tuesday and told me that magath called him in and told him about celtics interest
4032640 he said celtic wanted him and asked how he might feel about that alexander told him he was open to all possibilities but that scotland would not be his first choice
4032641 other big clubs are also interested but celtic are playing in the champions league the only concern for the player would be the scottish league
4032642 we also have other possibilities but those clubs are still deciding celtic are talking to wolfsburg already
4032643 i can confirm ive had contact from another scottish club who made a bid for the player this week
4032644 estoy feliz pero hay que tener prudencia hemos hecho muchos goles y hemos creado muchas ocasiones y tambi n estoy feliz de no haber recibido tantos porque en este tipo de eliminatorias no recibir es vital sabemos que hemos hecho cosas bien y otras que no
4032645 al principio hemos tenido alg n susto pero rafael m rquez y carles puyol lo han controlado muy bien
4032646 no nos han llegado tanto porque hemos sabido atacar y posicionalmente hemos estado bien
4032647 estoy muy contento por l ha sido un a o dif cil porque lleg en una temporada complicada pero es un jugador extraordinario con un potencial muy grande y hoy ha hecho un gran partido
4032648 el barcelona nos ha despertado bruscamente de nuestro sue o no hay nada que discutir en cuanto al resultado porque la derrota ha sido merecida no hemos sido capaces de jugar contra ellos y nos han barrido del campo
4032649 if az make their interest official then blackburn will have to make a decision
4032650 when there was interest in the winter rovers were very clear that they would not sell
4032651 thats why i dont imagine it will be easy now because andre is an important player
4032652 but he is very interested in the possibilities available at az he is very positive about that fantasy cricket

4032657 i love kittehs we love food i aint no kitteh and i aint no dude
4032658 the difference is huge and once youve opened up your palate to loose tea its hard to go back to bags
4032659 nobody wants to be taught about tea or anything else at a restaurant
4032660 but they do want to be exposed to new tastes and were trying to do that in a fun way
4032661 a slew of countries in the developing world the far east asia australia central africa all these folks eat bugs
4032662 a lot of this is what youre used to and getting people to try something new the idea of adding this thing that it is unusual and typically thought of as a pest and not a meal is a tough hump to get over but i think we are slowly getting people to realize it is ok
4032663 hey this stuff is good we can serve it to people
4032664 to draw a new map of china a food map that focuses on the outlying regions of present day china
4032665 we realized that we were witnessing the most dramatic social and economic change china felt like a raging river swollen with floodwaters running fast and furious the economic prosperity in china is wildly uneven and its non han china thats frequently on the short end
4032666 its organized in a very predictable fashion so people would be on familiar ground you dont learn things by having them stuck in front of your nose next to a salad from inner mongolia will be a salad from southern yunnan
4032667 all we can ever say is this is what we saw we like being flies on the wall we like participating
4032668 i love understanding whats going on and food is one of those wonderful routes to understanding everyone has to eat so you get to see the patterns of how food comes into the markets how people shop how they prepare the food for us its not a thing in itself food is an expression of culture
4032669 we have a sense that theres been a crackdown across china because the beijing government wants the olympics to go smoothly it is a totalitarian state
4032670 but in the meantime people are trying to live their lives having babies trying to breathe they go through these cycles of trying to breathe and once they have full lungs beijing goes phsst
4032671 people are trying to get on with their lives and to have some freedom from surveillance and oppression but as things loosen then people start to speak more freely then the government cracks down on free speech until beijing learns how to deal in a nuanced way with dissenting opinion there will be these crackdowns and lack of freedom of thought and speech will remain part of the culture of the peoples republic

4032691 id love to have had clint at this festival im a huge fan of his directorial work sadly one cant get everything one wants universal studios decided not to offer the film to us
4032692 id be really surprised if he didnt get a best actor nomination for this film

4032744 a person like me whos totally with my children all day its great to open my eyes to whats going on to get involved
4032745 the idea is that we would open this convention up to the public
4032746 hopefully it will be one of the things that shows were out talking and are interested in what regular people have to say and the problems in their lives right now
4032747 one thing we do were asking people to volunteer for the campaign
4032748 if you are i will make note of it we always need extra help were building teams right now
4032749 what would the point be if we got the word out to our supporters and only people who are politically active came down
4032750 we thought it would serve more of a purpose to talk to people who were just here but may be interested in whats going on and may have a question to ask

4032765 weve been doing it for almost two years now but the success of it has only just recently started to boom with the credit crunch setting in
4032766 people need to find different ways to go out and this helps
4032767 its also great for us because we get produce at a good price although we have high standards so the food we get in has to meet those
4032768 we find the home grown stuff is often much better than what we can get from the suppliers
4032769 when we get the good stuff and it gets on to the specials board its brilliant

4032773 just one policeman caused everything to go out of control
4032774 im mostly concerned about the actions of one officer who was identified by all six complainants

4032780 in my 20 years this is the tightest election ive ever seen
4032781 we have a series of really unexpected and unusual circumstances nothing in winslow is typical
4032782 i guess theyre trying to blackball russell bates and beat him up so everybody else just stands back
4032783 i cant remember a year when i didnt do one
4032784 were living with mr bates mistakes when he served up here for 23 years allowing the water and sewer department to drive itself into the ground
4032785 he had a chance to do something about it and he did a bad job
4032786 hes going to blame me for water and sewer rates i havent been on the committee in five years as soon as he got on he was spending money
4032787 ive never seen a fire this intense burn so fast

4032805 this is really not the case of an adult having committed a sexual assault on a child

4032808 to move it in my view should be a last resort i dont think were there yet
4032809 instead of allowing the court to reexamine the matter with the new information mr corbett chose to conclude there was no justification to reopen the case
4032810 mr corbett disregarded the wishes of dr barnes and the interests of this community
4032811 the foundations move has been thoroughly vetted and judicially determined to be the best available alternative
4032812 it will actually enable the foundation to increase its exposure to the common people dr barnes intended to reach while retaining its existing facilities to display additional artifacts that have been in storage due to a lack of gallery space

4032834 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 45 days compared to 56 days last quarter and 53 days in q1 of last year inventory turns were 21 7x this quarter up from the 20 3x achieved in q4
4032835 on the product side total store systems shipped were up 35 percent year over year entry level units continue their aggressive growth and were up 74 percent the high end was also quite robust with units shipped up 36 percent this is clear evidence of the expansion of our product offerings both up and down market the mid range growth was not nearly so aggressive but still represents over 50 percent of systems revenues total terabyte shipped were 195 terabytes and the mix was 63 percent ata 33 percent fibre channel and 4 percent sas

4032837 we are looking at the top 5 000 buyers of storage in the world or the s5000 in march we had achieved high penetration in just under 10 penetration of those customers we had now penetration in about 17 percent and did not yet have a presence in more than 73 percent of the s5000 the percentage of our highly penetrated accounts has grown modestly mostly through the efforts in growing our lesser penetrated accounts the highly penetrated category includes many of our top enterprise accounts or teas which had flattened out or declined as the economy slowed however in the us non federal market our teas grew 11 percent over q1 of last year for the first double digit growth quarter in a long time this reinforces our belief that the lull in growth was a result of spending constraints not losses to competition
4032838 our v series controllers had their best quarter ever with units more than doubling over q1 last year
4032839 early leading indicators from our awareness campaign are encouraging with more than double the number of unique visitors to our website significantly increased sales inquiries and almost a 5x increase in global online search clicks for netapp

4032912 the organisation has deficiencies which impact adversely on ethnic minority solicitors
4032913 the sra at present lacks the drive and the equality and diversity competence within its managerial and leadership spheres to make the changes happen
4032914 black and minority solicitors faced racism this is as serious for the legal profession as the lawrence inquiry was for racism in the metropolitan police
4032915 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
4032916 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
4032917 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react
4032918 she was really upset about everything that happened after the scandal last year people in india were burning effigies of her in the street
4032919 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone that shes not a racist
4032920 one of them clearly he missed i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there

4032945 weve signed my new contract today im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4032946 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
4032947 our country rejoices with pride at our national achievements let us take a pledge on this occasion to strive towards realising the dream of a developed india where all citizens have the opportunity to live with dignity and fully develop their potential
4032948 i take this opportunity to pay my respectful homage to our valiant freedom fighters who made supreme sacrifices for the cause of our independence let us celebrate by rededicating ourselves to secure for our nation its rightful place in the world
4032949 rakshabandhan is celebrated all over the country by tying of rakhis around the wrists of brothers by sisters thus strengthening the fraternal bonds of affection between brothers and sisters the festival promotes the feelings of peaceful coexistence and harmonious social life by reaffirming our faith in the traditional values of love and protection

4032953 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the by products they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
4032954 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
4032955 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
4032956 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
4032957 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences
4032958 sir bob wants answers about what has been going on max is keen to meet him and explain he only has his daughters future at heart but he has a tough job on his hands
4032959 peaches is expecting fireworks although she knows her dad will respect her wishes
4032960 peaches was ashamed of the overdose and worried shed end up like amy winehouse
4032961 so when she met max again who is a nice boy and a harvard graduate she thought being alongside him would steer her life on a different path
4032962 he was the nicest boy she could find quickly enough and was the key to her escaping the drugs that have been bringing her down
4032963 as these schools return there are no classroom blocks and lack of teaching staff is also affecting them
4032964 in most of the schools classes are combined primary one and two three and four as a result of having no teaching staff and rooms
4032965 wachienge primary school in odeke subcounty has two teachers while omore hills primary school in patiko sub county is some times closed because the teachers do not turn up sometimes
4032966 girls in most cases are looked at as wealth and with this biting poverty in the region parents tend to marry their daughters off at an early age
4032967 girls need to be handled in a way that can make them stay in schools
4032968 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
4032969 we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again

4032974 in the near future sentry will conduct high resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible
4032975 we had tested the auv as best we could before we got out here but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter
4032976 sentry is a true robot functioning on its own in the deep water
4032977 this tells us that sleeps role in emotional memory preservation is more than just mechanistic in order to preserve what it deems most important the brain makes a trade off strengthening the memorys emotional core and obscuring its neutral background
4032978 our results revealed that the study subjects who stayed awake all day largely forgot the entire negative scene they had seen with their memories of both the central objects and the backgrounds decaying at similar rates
4032979 sleep is a smart sophisticated process you might say that sleep is actually working at night to decide what memories to hold on to and what to let go of
4032980 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
4032981 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
4032982 every so often the rearrangements may be advantageous those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
4032983 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
4032984 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
4032985 most solid tumours have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumour cells one way that tumour cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
4032986 its becoming increasingly important that we keep our professional and social lives separate and manage our online reputation as effectively as possible
4032987 there have been plenty of stories lately involving the type of behaviour that is completely inappropriate for a work environment people need to realise that even virtual actions can have very real consequences
4032988 always employ your usual good manners when online work out who your true frolleagues are and remember that social networking is meant to enhance your social and professional life not obliterate it
4032989 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
4032990 the role of gigantic corporations in food production was leading humanity towards absolute disaster driving small farmers off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unimaginable awfulness
4032991 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4032992 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
4032993 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them

4033012 the pandavas were in great difficulty at one time krishna wanted to save them he approached the sage durvasa who was known for his anger and fury
4033013 krishna told durvasa oh sage protect these five fellows today
4033014 durvasa said krishna i will protect them but on one condition i will not utter a lie
4033015 so the sage dug a big pit telling the five fellows the pandavas to sit in the pit to hide themselves then he put a wooden plank over the pit and sat there on the plank doing his penance
4033016 in the meantime the kauravas the enemies were in search of the five pandavas
4033017 durvasa was very angry they are here he shouted they are here then the kauravas who were very much afraid of the saint thinking oh he will curse us ran away from there
4033018 a treatment that is good for one patient might not be effective on a different patient
4033019 before putting it on the market the drug was not tested on pregnant women and so we dont really know what would happen if one took it however we are not willing to risk it because the first three months are the crucial months it is when most changes are taking place
4033020 for the management of uncomplicated malaria the world health organisation who and the uganda ministry of health recommend the use of artemesinin combination therapy act like artesunate and artemether
4033021 if the artemesinin drugs are taken on their own resistance could set in thus no effective treatment or cure for the sickness
4033022 we think that this is unacceptable and grossly contravenes the commercial laws of the republic of liberia
4033023 for this reason all possible steps are taken to isolate any patients with vre to thoroughly clean the environments with which they have had contact to screen any patients who they may have been in contact with and to explain the situation to these patients
4033024 it is possible the patient in question was vre infected before coming to lismore base hospital
4033025 returning from munich 70 years ago in 1938 british prime minister neville chamberlain said about czechoslovakia which had just been dismembered its a small far away place about which we know nothing
4033026 those countries who value freedom and democracy must stand up for it whenever it is threatened
4033027 we cant allow a second munich when the international community climbed down to hitler
4033028 if military aggression is being justified by the need to protect russian citizens then this should cause concern for all countries with russian nationals living within their borders
4033029 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
4033030 the rta told us a speed camera was not warranted
4033031 they said it would take a death on the highway before that might happen
4033032 you just hear the squeal of tyres and hold your breath
4033033 and they line up in convoys of eight and nine at a time
4033034 you hear drivers on the cb radio channel 29 asking where the police are when its clear thats a free ticket to speed
4033035 but at the end of the day we need a highway upgrade
4033036 we could have ended this term of the council in reasonable equanimity but you made sure that we didnt the motion is factually wrong quite divisive and unnecessary

4033040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4033041 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4033042 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4033043 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4033044 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4033045 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4033046 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4033047 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4033052 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4033053 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4033054 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4033055 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4033056 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4033057 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4033058 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4033059 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4033060 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4033061 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4033066 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4033067 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4033068 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4033069 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4033070 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4033071 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4033072 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4033073 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4033074 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4033075 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4033076 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4033077 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4033078 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4033079 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4033080 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4033081 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4033082 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4033083 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4033084 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4033085 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4033086 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4033087 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4033090 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4033091 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4033092 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4033093 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4033094 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4033095 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4033096 the health certificate was rejected as they felt it was discriminating against the models
4033097 it gave me something to look forward to and focus on rather than being depressed
4033098 everything on it has been done by ben and myself
4033099 its been a good bonding experience he dad taught me a lot of things
4033100 sebenarnya dalam islam apabila seseorang lelaki itu telah berkenan dengan seorang wanita dan ingin menjadikan teman hidupnya sepatutnya lelaki itu berjumpa dengan wali si perempuan tadi untuk menyatakan niatnya untuk masuk meminang tetapi masyarakat sekarang silap mereka terus berjumpa dengan yang empunya diri dan terus menyatakan niat hatinya kemudian mereka bercinta berjanji sumpah setia dan segala galanya sedangkan ibubapa mereka langsung tidak tahu akan perhubungan mereka ini setelah sekian lama bercinta apabila ingin melangsungkan perkahwinan emak dan ayah tak bersetuju dengan mengeluarkan pelbagai alasan
4033101 ibu bapa mungkin sudah ada pilihan mereka sendiri oleh itu dengan menyatakan niat kepada ibubapa mereka akan berjumpa sendiri dengan wali perempuan tadi untuk mengenali mereka dan calon menantu mereka dengan lebih jelas setelah kedua dua pihak bersetuju barulah dijalankan upacara peminangan iaitu kedua dua insan tadi telah menjadi tunang apabila sudah menjadi tunangan orang adalah haram perempaun itu dipinang oleh lelaki lain seperti yang telah dijelaskan oleh rasulullah dalam hadis baginda dalam masa pertunangan inilah kedua dua pihak lelaki dan perempuan tadi akan saling mengenali antara satu sama lain bagi memastikan adakah ini merupakan pasangan hidupnya yang sebenar jika kedua duanya sudah bersetuju barulah pernikahan dilangsungkan
4033102 ich seh f r mich keinen sinn darin also muss das jedem auch so gehen
4033103 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4033104 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4033105 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4033106 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4033107 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4033108 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4033109 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4033110 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4033111 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4033112 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4033113 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4033114 when i wrote on palestinian art it was in response to the call of edward said who urged the members of my generation to reconstruct the palestinian narrative from our chaotic world
4033115 but this is not an abstract matter for me and so i dont want to speak theoretically i spent years conducting field research and publishing my findings to see someone whom i was happy to help write her book publish it as if it were the first study on the subject when the truth is that a number of books have already been written on palestinian art made me very sad her book failed to give my work due credit which is inappropriate both academically and personally as this was someone whom i considered a friend
4033116 in any civilized society that follows a code of ethics
4033117 the appropriation of intellectual property in the academic field is equivalent to the appropriation of land and territory in the world of power and political domination the audacity by which gannit ankori appropriated her information and called it her own follows the very same pattern that one can trace throughout the history of israeli culture
4033118 i couldnt help but think about the first time that gannit came to visit
4033119 she brought two paintings by her son amir and i hung them in my study until the colors vanished
4033120 an error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation nor does truth become error because nobody sees it
4033121 i arrive in amsterdam and new york and his letters continue to follow me
4033122 i want him to leave me alone to get on with his life to write a book of his own he wrote accused and slandered enough and his allegations proved baseless there is a principle here occupier occupied relations t p that he is riding on he knew how to take it there
4033123 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
4033124 the mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force
4033125 we hope that the armys conclusion does not appear to give soldiers free license to fire without being sure of the target greatly hindering the medias ability to cover the conflict
4033126 dont need to be loved and therefore the evacuation of yitzhar will look like the evacuation of umm al fahm would
4033127 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
4033128 look hes an expert on iraq go talk to him
4033129 my goodness thats an awful lot in one letter solving so many of the white houses problems all at once
4033130 no no tim that was just one source who said that
4033131 i have no knowledge not that i want to have knowledge not that i dug to find knowledge i have no knowledge
4033132 you know maybe its time for us to meet with the americans
4033133 can we help at this point you know we get it alright
4033134 we can help with iraq we can help with afghanistan we know these countries
4033135 you know ron you know ive been talking about these democratic values my whole life but finally just in the last month im really starting to understand their power
4033136 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
4033137 look at my situation im now going to wash away the entire musharraf power structure because the fact is is im rising and hes plummeting thats one opponent also the jihadists are realizing that i might create a counterpoint in this whole region to bin laden so now ive got two enemies of course who have been in an unholy alliance dictatorial power messianic radicalism for many years and i have no protection why because dick cheney wont make the phone call
4033138 its like in a thriller where you see the heroine open the door a crack and you know that the man with the knife is going to come in and stab her
4033139 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
4033140 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed

4033144 you see it was the only workers i could get
4033145 it really is a demographic divide in whats happening with the white population in this country and whats happening with minorities and its mostly due to immigration
4033146 itll feed into the immigration debate first of all and probably the election
4033147 congress has been kind of slow to make decisions about immigration but these numbers i think will probably put this back on a lot of peoples minds

4033152 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4033153 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4033154 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4033155 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4033156 share how obamas policies have been directly shaped by the people he has met as he traveled the country
4033157 we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4033158 it is unfortunate that many people business executives as well as so called security experts believe that the implementation of one or two security products can address security issues there cannot be a one size fits all approach to security as each environment is different with its own set of vulnerabilities and some security products themselves contain flaws which increase a networks vulnerability rather than reduce it
4033159 indeed if businesses are serious about security they need to understand that the only way to truly check that they are secure is to view the code thats one of the reasons i believe open source software is the better option for companies where security is of the utmost concern its not that open source is more secure but rather the fact that you can view the code see any vulnerabilities yourself and even fix if necessary if you have the skills to do so

4033169 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4033170 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4033171 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4033172 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4033173 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4033177 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4033178 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4033179 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4033180 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4033181 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4033182 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4033183 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4033184 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4033185 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4033186 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4033187 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4033188 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4033211 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4033212 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4033213 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4033215 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4033216 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

4033220 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial

4033226 we must be conscious that there is a war on the roadways of the entire world where every day hundreds of people die for many different reasons speedy intervention is needed to reduce the number of victims because this is real destruction it will not be easy but it is a challenge that we should face with great determination
4033227 one day will be devoted to each of the four sub sectors for which guidance is needed the first day will be dedicated to road users truckers automobile drivers those who travel by train and all who work in transportation related services the second to women on the streets the third to children on the streets and the fourth to the homeless
4033228 the most important thing to keep in mind is that the church is committed to raising awareness and regaining a sense of responsibility in those who use the road to decrease traffic accidents the contribution of the christian community is necessary but in addition to the church schools families and institutions must also work to further this cause and work to create respect for applicable laws
4033229 the scary statistics we hear on the television and read in the daily newspapers that demonstrate a lack of respect for life that is why we have called this summit in october in bogot to look for a way to confront the problem it will begin with the continental conference and will later focus on the parish and diocesan environments another important topic tied to the street is that of children being forced to beg or rummage through garbage

4033253 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4033254 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4033255 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4033256 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4033257 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

4033350 over the years silt and encroachment has reduced many wetlands to half their size
4033351 some years back the water levels were very high in wetlands but now the depth has reduced significantly
4033352 water is of prime importance for a wetland to survive otherwise it will turn into a marsh
4033353 we agree that there are some challenges before us vis vis preservation of wetlands but we are trying to preserve them
4033354 we are raising the bunds along the periphery of these water bodies to maintain an optimum water level
4033355 this is possible only if government seriously takes up the task of preserving these water bodies
4033356 the encroached land needs be reclaimed so that the wetlands regain their charm
4033357 the damage can be controlled if officials and people are made aware of the importance of wetlands

4033498 the money was going to fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
4033499 i guess more than anything it s a little bit annoying that we ve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
4033500 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding

4033504 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas australian workplace agreements or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
4033505 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith

4033527 if not for clifford vargas katya and i never would have met so obviously his circus means a lot to both of us when circus vargas closed in 2003 so we revived circus vargas in 2006
4033528 were honored to be devoting our lives to bringing smiles to the faces in our audiences to see three generations of one family all enjoying the show is one of the biggest thrills you can imagine

4033552 it made me worry and want to stay inside and just wait for my three year contract to end
4033553 i think the scalability of some of these u s brands into international markets has been a big factor
4033554 specifically if you look at facebook and hi5 what theyre doing in terms of foreign language interface translation and their emphasis on cultural relevance in each of the markets theyre expanding to has helped them grow pretty dramatically across all global regions
4033555 translation opens the door and all the other things follow
4033556 they didnt offer translations until this year facebook was behind the curve not as localized as myspace or hi5
4033557 they were doing very well in the english speaking world but not until providing localized content could they tap into that growth
4033558 we have a member translation tool that allows users to translate different words it helps with colloquialisms and slang and different spellings of words and those get captured and flagged by users and then the community votes on the accuracy
4033559 even though many are u s based in terms of overall usage the u s market is a pretty mature market
4033560 its not going to sustain the level of growth its seen over the past few years but its definitely an audience to grow if you emphasize these global regions

4033568 die entscheidung vieler firmen ihre auslandsproduktion nach deutschland zur ckzuholen zeigt dass der standort deutschland und besonders bayern wieder deutlich an attraktivit t gewinnt
4033569 nach berechnungen des fraunhofer instituts f r system und innovationsforschung in karlsruhe haben in den letzten acht jahren ber 3500 firmen allein in den branchen metall und chemie ihre produktion aus dem ausland zur ckgeholt
4033570 ich begr e es dass die unternehmen ihre standortentscheidungen zunehmend realistischer angehen die analyse aller relevanten standortfaktoren im vorfeld eines auslandsengagements erfolgt heute gr ndlicher
4033571 zwar werden unsere bayerischen firmen die die n he zu neuen m rkten suchen sicher auch k nftig im ausland produzieren wir werden aber alles unternehmen um den standort bayern im internationalen wettbewerb weiterhin so konkurrenzf hig wie m glich zu halten deswegen rechne ich mit weiter steigenden r ckverlagerungen von auslandsproduktionen

4033590 all the activities recommended in the book help alleviate poverty
4033591 but do so in a respectful and sustainable way that both the host and the visitor can be proud of
4033592 we designed the book to appeal to tourists who want to pick up a copy and go and for tour operators and travel agents who would like to add responsible travel experiences to their mekong sub region itineraries
4033593 our aim now is to channel that growth more equitably towards sustainable and responsible tourism operators that help us conserve culture and at the same time fight poverty

4033644 a detailed analysis of the aircraft sale was however not provided for audit and i could therefore not ascertain what was sold and what expected proceeds were
4033645 we sold it at 1 million because it had turned into a scrap and not an aircraft as such and the valuation was done by swipco
4033646 i request that you give us one week to provide accountability
4033647 this is stealing government money this was no scrap but an aircraft which needed to be boarded off and there was nothing classified as far as this money was concerned
4033648 whoever took this 1 million is going to pay back
4033649 we cannot accept what these officials are telling us because this was a helicopter valued at about 2 million
4033650 it was noted that the proceeds euros 1 5 million were not receipted and banked as revenue instead they were banked in the foreign exchange account with bank of uganda where it was utilised without authority from the secretary to the treasury

4033680 right now were still on yellow and were still working hard
4033681 theres a little bit of caution but boy hes looking good and were excited and happy for him
4033682 ive come out a couple times and actually played defense and chased him down and made him work to explode and cut
4033683 hes really getting close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light
4033684 im not a doctor im just telling you where we are right now
4033685 hes made tremendous strides and i would think with carnell anything is possible
4033686 weve got size weve got speed weve got youth weve got a lot of talent and its up to me to get it out of them when its all said and done i hope we have some hard decisions to make
4033687 somebodys got to step up antonio bryant is doing that antonio bryant is the one guy i think from a talent standpoint and obviously now getting some experience in these last three weeks that is picking it up but we need a couple more guys to do that starting sunday i hope
4033688 hes got a lot of talent if you just watch the raw talent you see a guy with size speed and excellent hands hes learning two or three positions right now hes cross training which is really hard but im really impressed with him hes a tremendous worker and he made some plays today again that are exceptional were excited about him
4033689 its hard to imagine that at this point we are at wednesday and hes still not able to move around at full speed id like to see him start and finish a practice before we declare him ready to play
4033690 well its a good start the punt return and kickoff returns are the first play of offense we like to start outside our own 20 or 25 yard line i think we were one of the top teams in football in starting inside our 20 obviously our third down defense our punt return opportunities have to get better we still have a ways to go on our kickoff return we didnt function there as well as id hoped although it was the first preseason game thats got to be an area where we create field position we do have some dynamic returners and guys with pride and hopefully it continues to get better and better special teams coordinator rich bisaccia is one of the best in football in my opinion
4033691 he proved he can run he can catch he can block he can cover kicks hes learned this tremendously difficult offense to learn were really pleased with his abilities that he put on tape he didnt get nervous he showed real poise hes a football player that guy did well for himself
4033692 nothing really has changed here we are in the third week of training camp and youre talking about key football players rb cadillac williams petitgout galloway and garcia we miss those guys but the status hasnt changed pup he doesnt seem close to coming back on the practice field but he is working hard its a credit to him its a hard time for him
4033693 yeah yes there sure is thats why hes not active at this point in time i do know our training staff is working hard and luke is working hard the injury just isnt ready to go yet
4033694 i think hes had a consistent camp as he always does hes a guy that can play inside or outside and hes functional on any phase of special teams hes a team guy and hes a reliable football player
4033695 it is remarkable he got hurt in the last preseason game and hes had some long dark hours during the rehab lonely times but hes in a position now to reap the benefits of all this hard work and we need to see him do that come sunday night
4033696 one of the hard drives on a shared hosting server being corrupted
4033697 as is the case with any counter insurgency peacekeeping operations there is a high possibility of corruption and ill discipline in the ranks we are beginning to see the problems that have settled into the system
4033698 you used this set at the last stamp camp how can you sell it
4033699 a new book the longevity revolution recently argued that in the coming century the human lifespan will extend to 120 years robert butler the books author is a professor of geriatrics at a medical school in new york and is still working at the age of 80
4033700 it is sheer foolishness to imagine that we can extend life without substantial governmental participation
4033701 indeed some believe that humans can master their evolution among them is aubrey de grey of cambridge university who suggests a life expectancy of five thousand years by 2100 17 the philosopher john harris of oxford views extraordinary longevity from another perspective when he considers the possibility of immortality and its consequences for mankind 18
4033702 the nih works as follows governmental officials do not decide who receives grants to conduct research study sections composed of scientists from universities do so this is called peer review and it has worked uncommonly well proposals are either rejected or approved and given scores however in 2007 only about 15 to 20 percent of approved grants were funded depending on the institute i believe that at least 30 percent of approved grants if not more should be funded when funds are tight review committees act too cautiously and conservatively funds should be available to support risky research
4033703 today less than 1 percent of the entire federal budget is spent on medical research both to improve health and control costs i propose that 3 percent of the nations overall health bill 1 8 trillion projected as 2005 or 54 billion be available to nih for medical research from federal revenues i also propose that of medicare expenditures 1 percent or 3 billion be devoted to the national institute on aging this investment should increase in line with the medicare budget but scientific research in fact could lower medicare expenditures to give some perspective the fy2006 nia budget approached 1 billion the national alzheimers disease association argued in 2005 that the nih as a whole should devote at least 1 billion annually for research on alzheimers disease while the numbers i am suggesting may seem extraordinary i believe the level of scientific progress in the field since the 1950s justifies such a program which could be dubbed the apollo program for aging and longevity science
4033704 an orbital jump in financing of science is required to advance longevity and health as well as national wealth
4033705 it may soon be possible to delay both aging and age related disease in humans
4033706 the present level of development of aging and longevity research justifies an apollo type effort to control aging now we have both past work as a foundation and new scientific tools offering hope that we may soon have a more prolonged vigorous and productive life and added longevity during the twenty first century the century of the life sciences longevity science should truly come of age
4033707 advances in genomics and regenerative medicine will give us advances in longevity
4033708 some members of congress for example worrying about costs of increasing numbers of older persons fear and oppose success of life extension research
4033709 the 2005 whcoa white house conference on aging was the first time a president george bush did not appear although he was only an hour or so away speaking to an upscale audience of older persons about the medicare prescription act it was ironic indeed absurd that the administration killed funding for a training of teachers in geriatrics at the same time that the whcoa was in process
4033710 science will find new ways to extend life and its quality evidence suggests that morbidity can be further compressed and society can adapt to the growing numbers of older persons
4033711 now in the twenty first century we may be poised at the frontier of biological time the prospect of germline engineering the means by which the human species would direct its own evolution and extend its life span
4033712 enthusiasts over the future of cell tissue and organ replacement imagine successive comprehensive reconstitutions of the body replacement or regenerative medicine would push death back presumably indefinitely
4033713 one must not doubt the possibility of the unexpected in science and the uneven evolution of knowledge
4033714 aging as a by product of selection for reproductive performance
4033715 his clarion call to action is the message neither of a madman nor a bad man but of a brilliant beneficent man of goodwill who wants only for civilization to fulfill the highest hopes he has for its future
4033716 seems to me this man could be put in jail with reasonable cause
4033717 this book about the ongoing revolution in human longevity and its implications for society was written by robert butler a professor of geriatrics who is still working at the age of 80
4033718 could be dubbed the apollo program for aging and longevity science
4033719 the present level of development of aging and longevity research justifies an apollo type effort to control aging now we have both past work as a foundation and new scientific tools offering hope that we may soon have a more prolonged vigorous and productive life and added longevity during the twenty first century the century of the life sciences longevity science should truly come of age
4033720 it may soon be possible to delay both aging and age related disease in humans
4033721 an orbital jump in financing of science is required to advance longevity and health as well as national wealth
4033722 while the numbers i am suggesting may seem extraordinary i believe the level of scientific progress in the field since the 1950s justifies such a program
4033723 at least 30 percent of approved grants if not more should be funded
4033724 science will find new ways to extend life and its quality evidence suggests that morbidity can be further compressed and society can adapt to the growing numbers of older persons

4033737 weve made progress but weve got a long way to go
4033738 i think as evident today our no 2 offense was horrific in spots against the no 1 defense im disappointed today in that but all in all ive seen a lot of positive things but we have a lot of work to do we have some tough decisions to make some of the decisions will be made by the players thats why we practice the way we do
4033739 im pleased with the effort of the football team the coaches and the players are working together and im really pleased with that
4033740 we also havent sacrificed reps if anything weve gained reps although theyre not full speed ones indoors i think its been a huge upgrade to our training camp here and im very thankful obviously to the owners for going to that expense to provide that to us its hopefully going to be a winning edge for us
4033741 he spoke to the team and got a chance to visit with a lot of the players if you ask me and this is just my opinion he is global he is the number one superstar in all of sports at least on my list he hits all the shots all the time hes got complete mental control hes unbelievable and hopefully some of that rubs off on us lets just hope it does because hes high class character a great role model for just about every phase of life i cant say enough about him
4033742 i cant comment for everybody but he had a couple great messages
4033743 he doesnt say a lot at least he didnt last night but he was cordial he was polite he was outgoing with the players and i think everybody gained something i know i did ill treasure that for the rest of my life
4033744 again nobody is going to outwork the guy nobody what an inspiring guy it was awesome

4033792 this is very progressive and the government is trying to raise the number of women in parliament but i think the biggest challenge will be whether the quantity can be matched with quality
4033793 when you bring in this many new candidates onto a list you are going to get people who are very new to the process and who may lack experience
4033794 during many years of war the soldiers were in control everything was militarised and men were very much in control
4033795 for a long time men did the work while women stayed at home and did the domestic work very little importance was given to women and during the war women had little chance of education
4033796 but also during this time women started to think about things they could do to stop the war and they started to talk about peace
4033797 mothers saw their sons taking part in the war and saw some not coming home and those that did were traumatised and mutilated and this moved women to do things to bring about peace
4033798 women are participating more because they know they need to fight for the keeping of peace angola has as lot of women living here more women than men and women are very much involved in the communication in communities and the point of view held by people
4033799 i think men are ready to start listening to women i think this country is prepared for the participation of women
4033800 the war was a very sad memory and no one wants a repetition of that angola and society doesnt want to repeat the war
4033801 this is fundamental a lot of children are not getting an education because of a lack of schools and a lack of money this is a very big preoccupation for mothers

4034080 we get the water from eight in the morning to one in the afternoon but the problem is that the water comes directly from the well to our house untreated and is really unsafe to drink
4034081 there are times when the pump at the well breaks down and we have to revert to donkey water which is less hygienic than tap water
4034082 my family of eight used to rely on water fetched in 20 litre jerrycans on the heads of my wife and our daughters but we started using donkey water since we live so far from the well our worst problem is not the purity of the water but the very high cost because of the rising fuel prices
4034083 crude oil prices are falling and i believe iron ore prices will also decline in the near future cpi growth is likely to continue to decelerate
4034084 the risk of further economic slowdown rather than increase of prices deserves more attention

4034096 if we were to meet our 2011 schedule we would have to begin letting the property in 2010 and we dont believe we would be able to achieve premium rates at this time we also think we are passing the peak of the contract cycle and steel prices are starting to fall so we hope to get some of the costs down involved with the building
4034097 the first phase of work which involves knocking the existing building is at a advanced stage but we will review placing of the contract for the development we have no date for completion but 2012 is the most likely at the moment

4034102 the people of this state are now of a very firm view that theres something very smelly about the way the government have conducted themselves
4034103 the only way well ever get the truth out of this is through a royal commission
4034104 this is the body who the state governments agency doir have contracted to be in charge of the safety regime where the explosion occurred
4034105 how can anybody have confidence that that is an independent inquiry

4034107 i want to make sure that everything that happens is revealed in an objective way and that recommendations that come from this inquiry by nopsa are acted upon
4034108 we now know doir lost the letter and doir requested no action from apache in relation to the issues that had been raised by docep
4034109 they the government came along later and said it doesnt matter docep were only worried about this bit of pipeline

4034118 at the age of 7 months babies will watch a fearful face for longer than a happy face and their attentiveness level as measured by eeg is higher after seeing a fearful than a happy face by contrast infants aged 5 months watch both faces when they are shown side by side for just as long and there is no difference in the intensity of attention in favour of the fearful face

4034147 law enforcement officials blew it out of proportion big time
4034148 i understand they have to do what they have to i think they went about it all wrong
4034149 this is the first time he called for help and this is what he got
4034150 he has been a little down in the dumps lately we have been having some financial trouble
4034151 if he had come out and talked with us he probably would not have been arrested
4034152 we would have taken him to the hospital he refused to talk with us and there were weapons involved thats when it becomes a tactical situation with the swat team
4034153 obviously there are issues but fortunately he surrendered and we hope hell get all the help he needs
4034154 they are the ones who induced the panic not him
4034155 hes had problems but i knew he wouldnt kill himself or hurt anybody else it was a man who needed help and when he called for it they sent the swat team

4034158 this third round of testing was for those people who came into very close contact with the last horse that contracted the virus
4034159 based on previous evidence with the hendra virus and another closely related virus called the nipah virus the virus can lay dormant and come back at a later date
4034160 weve looked at a whole heap of options but the balance of scientific opinion was that it was not worth the risk of human life to keep the horse alive
4034161 it started as a bit of numbness then i was having trouble going to the toilet and would drag my leg after walking for long periods i thought i was just getting lazy
4034162 the doctor said all the indicators were pointing toward multiple sclerosis ms i had my fingers crossed it was a pinched nerve but the scan came back clear
4034163 we performed an mri and diagnosed a spinal dural fistula
4034164 its a very uncommon but serious condition where you get an abnormal connection between arteries and veins within the spinal column causing damage to the spinal cord
4034165 its difficult to diagnose and people can go for years without making a diagnosis we were lucky we had a scan quite quickly
4034166 he had become paralysed from the waist down his recovery is one in a million
4034167 the main aim of the treatment is to stop the progression i was pleasantly surprised and very happy to see chris remarkable recovery its a very emotional thing to have someone walking again after they were paralysed
4034168 the progress without treatment would have been irreversible he would be paralysed from the waist down and it would probably have progressed to the upper body

4034176 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4034177 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
4034178 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
4034179 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

4034234 i have had the phone for a couple of weeks and i havent had any dropped calls until a couple of days ago now at least 50 percent of my calls get dropped or i get a call failed message when trying to make a call even though i have a strong signal on 3g
4034235 the phone will also bounce from 3g to edge to no service and then back to 3g the phone works fine if i turn off 3g but that defeats the purpose of having a 3g iphone

4034254 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4034255 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

4034261 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4034262 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4034263 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4034264 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4034265 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4034266 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4034267 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4034268 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
4034269 unii dintre angajatorii romani cred ca statul in scoala e pierdere de vreme ca meseria se invata numai la locul de munca
4034270 aduceau in italia si spania tinere romance pentru a le obliga sa se prostitueze unele dintre ele fiind sechestrate in locuinte si batute
4034271 o contributie fundamentala pentru succesul operatiunii a fost adusa de catre politistii romani care au colaborat cu echipa mobila a politiei din venetia si care actioneaza in italia de la sfarsitul lunii mai colaborand cu politia din alte orase italiene roma torino bologna padova si verona

4034274 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4034275 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4034276 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4034277 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4034278 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4034279 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4034280 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4034281 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4034282 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4034283 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4034284 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4034285 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4034286 the reason i went on the show was for all the older women out there
4034287 i wanted to show that a 55 year old woman can still strut her stuff
4034288 nobody seems to want to know about women when they get to 40 or even 50 but i want other older women to now come out of the woodwork and realise they can be sexy too
4034289 all the judges said i couldnt sing simon cowell said my spirit is great but my singing is terrible but they all agreed that i didnt look my age
4034290 simon asked me if id had surgery but i told him i am all natural he also asked if i was currently in a relationship and i told him i dont kiss and tell
4034291 dannii minogue said to me youre like a 12 year old trapped in a womans body and i said to her well who wants to grow old
4034292 this may not be the start of my singing career but its the start of me promoting how older women are sexy too you dont have be matronly and dress old
4034293 ive just had a really rough year at school with bullies so it was great to go on the x factor and for the judges to like what i was doing its given me real confidence simon cowell wasnt really looking at me at first but then when i started performing i really got his attention
4034294 cheryl cole couldnt stop smiliing her smile was just so big
4034295 whatever happens in the x factor its my dream to become a recording artist and to be someone that other girls can look up to
4034296 like a lot of people i was sceptical at first that this should be happening
4034297 the scepticism gave way to a real curiosity and a desire to know every wrinkle of it
4034298 it was the first known act of poisoning with a nuclear isotope certainly in the west it was shocking that you would have this happening in grosvenor square just a few hundred yards from the american embassy in a luxury hotel
4034299 how could this happen and nobody be brought to trial or there never be a coroners inquest or an inquiry which brought out everything that scotland yard has found
4034300 mi5 have complained openly that there are as many russian intelligence agents in london as there were during the cold war and keeping tabs on them takes up resources that they would rather devote to fighting terrorism
4034301 it was a widespread view and in a way it was justified by the fact that president yeltsin was an erratic leader the russian military was in steep decline and russias empire had shrunk down to russia itself
4034302 russia defaulted on its debts it was in a mess and it didnt really have a voice in world affairs part of the book chronicles how putin set about turning that around
4034303 but in the process i argued he and the wests handling of him had created a new cold war
4034304 some academics say this is not the old cold war it is about the west trying to encroach on what used to be russias sphere of influence and the russians trying to reassert their influence what we have seen in georgia is by far the most graphic example of that when the cold war flipped over into being a hot war for a week
4034305 western europe is going to rely on russia for 50 per cent of its natural gas by 2020 the network of pipelines bringing out not only russian oil and gas but also the products of the vast new oilfields in kazakhstan and central asia theyre the real power
4034306 it could have been revenge it could have been punishment and it could have been to prevent him from digging deeper into the business affairs of senior figures in russia
4034307 he repeated his denials and said he was the victim of this not the perpetrator
4034308 hes a very interesting guy hes a member of the russian parliament a national hero in russia and a prime suspect in britain
4034309 some of litvinenkos supporters say that if he putin did not know about it what does that say about the security of russian nuclear materials
4034310 when i started writing the book a couple of people i know a very senior international official and an ex military man said you are in very dangerous waters
4034311 one said i should drop the project like a hot potato and the other said i should make sure everything i wrote was stored encrypted on a remote server because you never know the security of your own computer
4034312 i talked to ex kgb and ex intelligence people for quite some time and you do look over your shoulder a bit more but and im touching wood as i say it i was able to write the book and publish it

4034338 assis are the best sites for wildlife and earth science in ni
4034339 this report is the culmination of six years work by scientific staff in niea it details how these sites are faring and the results will guide much of our management on assis over the next few years
4034340 we have managed to monitor all of the assis in ni with over 900 features being assessed a significant achievement given the scale and complexity of the work involved
4034341 the findings of this study are probably better than we could have anticipated when the programme of work commenced however a significant proportion of assis are in an unfavourable condition and more remains to be done to improve these sites
4034342 our long term goal is to have all of the assis in favourable condition and niea is working hard with dard and others to achieve this the findings of the report will help to direct conservation effort where it is most needed

4034558 that is 400 million allocated now for the purchase back of water entitlements in the northern basin from queensland and nsw down to the menindee lakes

4034605 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4034606 we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong

4034614 im glad that i won this race i was going to improve my time a bit more but to win this race is more important than to set a good time
4034615 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4034616 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4034617 the pressure was much less we swam together and i felt like we were in training
4034618 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4034619 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4034620 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4034621 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4034622 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4034623 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4034624 i strongly condemn the and the suppression on these oppressed people
4034625 to call for international involvement in the sovereign of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past

4034646 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4034647 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
4034648 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4034649 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
4034650 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family
4034651 im really not a chicken little player but i worry that no one seems to be focusing in on this
4034652 the level of excess capacity has shrunk down in the last few years to a level barely within the planning toleration of the industry
4034653 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage
4034654 however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
4034655 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
4034656 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
4034657 those who wear the uniform are a special class of citizen and they deserve special treatment because they have earned it
4034658 american airlines proved today that they also agree our troops deserve special treatment and i hope the other major carriers will follow their lead
4034659 we appreciate and marvel at the bravery and sacrifice our military personnel exhibit daily
4034660 anything we can do to support them and honor them is a top priority for american airlines
4034661 the soldiers have enough on their minds they should not have to worry about filling out forms and worrying about reimbursement for the costs of carrying their equipment
4034662 there is no reason that soldiers reporting for duty should have to pay out of their pocket for the cost of transporting the equipment they are required to bring

4034666 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
4034667 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
4034668 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with
4034669 it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
4034670 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
4034671 the recovery of this serviceman who was missing so long is an example of this nations commitment to honor not only his sacrifice but his familys as well
4034672 the efforts involved in recoveries like this involved more than 600 people from those who excavated the crash site to dna technicians to service casualty officers who look after the families left behind
4034673 i pretty well fell apart with that news i was just incredibly amazed happy and sad all at once my dad was coming home and coming home to a place of honor
4034674 my father married my mother and almost immediately shipped out she never saw him again and turned 18 right after he died i never had hope of knowing about my dad so this has been profound i am incredibly grateful to the joint pow mia accounting command and the work they do to bring our boys home
4034675 the girls are both under 10 it will take them awhile to understand but one thing i am sure of now i have a place to go to visit my dad

4034706 all we are saying at this stage is that the police helicopter was out moments after the explosion
4034707 those guys realised they were finished some of them stuffed money into their shirts obviously trying to get away with something they saw they could go nowhere but they still tried to grab some pocket money for the road
4034708 the police have been put on intensified street survival training and our guys in this team are all highly trained within their own areas of expertise
4034709 it furthermore is clear that even if a resident leaves his or her tent temporarily if only for a few hours to seek employment or find food or alternative accommodation their tent will be dismantled
4034710 the threat of violence against the applicants and others in their position has not dissipated
4034711 there is no dispute between the parties that the shelters should remain a temporary solution and that reintegration is urgent
4034712 there is no such 21 point document chinese media according to the chinese constitution are free to report on the games
4034713 the status of tec now means that lecturers who over the years looked up to the botswana teachersunion btu to negotiate on their behalf now do not know where they stand
4034714 the lecturers should have been consulted so they know how they fit in tecs new look since all along they fell under the tsm
4034715 this you must stand against knowing that all will be well again
4034716 they are disobedience and dont care these countries are standing on the back of africa but if you use education wisely and depend on god you will stand in the face of all of these
4034717 i am a bit surprised there are many other athletes more experienced than me but i think i can make a difference by being there for my teammates to listen and to talk to them i have learned a lot from the senior athletes on the other teams i have been on and hope i can help some of the younger ones or encourage them to talk to other senior athletes if they need to we definitely need to pull together as a team and support each other to do well
4034718 i think it is a bit far fetched to always try to seek out a relationship
4034719 chinese artists who were working overseas have started to move back to china and hope to get more attention during the olympics
4034720 by 2000 people began to realise that there was not that much art available from the 1980s and 1990s so the value would be important and we saw many new collectors
4034721 the district has become a fashionable spot with a fake art feel
4034722 yes well until may there was doubt as to his qualification i had to self fund my first european competition and i threw 20 41m and bang in the team
4034723 i had to go and see my sponsors in toowoomba to say i have no funding to go to europe and thats where i need to be to qualify my training was going really well and they came to the party and supported me to get over there where i did my job threw 2 qualifiers and then it was good i came back and had two weeks easy and then basically my eight week build up for here
4034724 except for the summer season since then i really havent had more than three or four weeks of solid training in a row my foots giving me a lot of trouble but im getting some good medical support im super strong and the most important thing when im throwing is for me to be strong if im weak and throwing well it doesnt mean ill throw far but if im strong and i can still put it out there im doing personal bests in the weight room and im pretty excited to be here
4034725 its good we dont have to room with any sprinters so im excited about that for a start
4034726 its been hard for us both to be actually throwing at the same time i was actually injured in 2004 and 2005 which put me out of the shot and justins been injured since 2004 even this year we didnt get to compete against each other as much as we would like to but its great to get to compete together nationals were great it really brought the best out in justin and he has kicked on its good fun
4034727 its just balmy im working on my tan in toowoomba its been 16 degrees for the last 3 months so this is great
4034728 throw big we are both in really good shape my throwing has really come through with a 20 30m and a 20 50m at the gold coast recently i think the big thing is that i for once am not injured i dont have any niggles thats the hardest thing with throwing scotty and i probably havent had a comp against each other both fully fit and the day we do its going to be a great comp
4034729 hopefully thats going to be friday all season i had a torn calf and i got over that at nationals and scottys had a sore foot but the shot putting in australia looks good and i think the best result for scotty and i would be an olympic final that would set us up for next year and the limelight would be on us as olympic finalists and throwing its good because we have always been the quiet achievers but at the end of the day we have always been the performers
4034730 i can say that my trainings been at seventy percent but my physical readiness is still pretty high ive sort of made a career out of it in the last few years because my preparation hasnt been perfect but ive still been able to throw a long way some of my personal bests have come when ive had no reason to do it when ive gone in with really bad preparation for whatever reason my preparation isnt bad this time its just not perfect so im still capable of throwing at one hundred percent
4034731 yes once we are in there well just go out and have a bash and try to throw with some of the bigger guys just to get used to it cantwell or hoffa or adams you just go out there and do a session with them and it gets your confidence going which is good
4034732 i find it a little bit ridiculous that were playing maybe 11 matches in seven days to be honest
4034733 you know i know it rained the first day but quite honestly i dont understand why we dont play such a big tournament over 10 days maybe
4034734 thats the only regret i have at the moment because i think this is asking just a little bit too much and too much trouble
4034735 theyve made it very hard on us players and i wish there were extra days for us to play
4034736 i know the difficulty of trying to win a medal here
4034737 its a difficult forum winning six matches in seven days plus five doubles matches if you want to win gold there as well
4034738 except in dubai in practice i never have to towel off basically after every point i play
4034739 the racquet gets wet grip gets wet slippery that makes it hard just having the proper feeling on the grip
4034740 but just being wet all over sweat in your eyes makes it a bit tricky
4034741 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4034742 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4034743 i received a healthy little boy in a spiderman suit who only needed a tonsillectomy but i left behind a pale sick child who was struggling to breathe
4034744 he was very cute in his red spiderman outfit i made a fuss over him and tried to make him feel comfortable i told him i would look after him carefully
4034745 i received him and he didnt look good at all he struggled to breathe and i struggled to get his oxygen levels up
4034746 he was a strange greyish pale colour not the healthy pink boy i had received that morning
4034747 i managed to scrape together the courage to go into his bedroom only seven months after his death
4034748 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
4034749 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
4034750 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
4034751 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
4034752 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling
4034753 we suggest that these weekly cycles are related to changes in atmospheric circulation over western europe maybe due to some indirect effect and interaction of aerosols with atmospheric dynamics

4034829 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good but that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4034830 i think maybe this afternoon im going to talk to eric mangini about it limit my throws a little bit i didnt throw the ball very well this morning underthrew some throws no pain but im 38 years old its got to be fatigued a little bit
4034831 youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4034832 like damien woody said today ive been here since july 19 doing all this stuff
4034833 ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday
4034834 die russen wollten uns abchasien und s dossetien wegnehmen die russischen truppen haben all das vernichtet was wir all diese jahre errichtet haben schulen krankenh user kinderg rten sie haben die wundersch ne stadt zchinwali dem erdboden gleich gemacht
4034835 wir haben vier jahre lang mit georgien gearbeitet und sind nun gescheitert alle sind schuld putin hat aber seine karten brillant ausgespielt er wei sehr gut was er tut und die folgen werden f r die usa negativ sein
4034836 sein monopol im globalisierungsprozess und auf die rolle eines demokratie messias
4034837 der russisch georgische konflikt ist keinesfalls der vorbote eines kalten krieges sondern eher ein signal zur berpr fung der vern nftigkeit jener demokratie ideologen dank denen der stil des zweifelhaften denkens und der lauten losungen durchgesetzt wurde womit in wirklichkeit die entstehung stabiler regierungen in der welt gef hrdet wird
4034838 der pr sident ist weiterhin fest davon berzeugt dass georgien ein teil der nato werden muss genauso wie die ukraine und alle anderen l nder die danach streben
4034839 russland musste antworten es der aggression gegen das schwache schutzlose georgien zu beschuldigen ist nicht nur heuchlerisch sondern zeigt einen mangel an humanit t indem die usa den kaukasus eine region die tausende von meilen vom amerikanischen kontinent entfernt ist zu einer sph re des nationalen interesses erkl rten begingen sie einen ernsthaften fehler nat rlich ist der friede im kaukasus im interesse aller aber einzusehen dass russland dort verwurzelt ist durch eine gemeinsame geographie und jahrhundertelange geschichte ist einfach gesunder menschenverstand russland strebt nicht nach territorialer expansion aber hat legitime interessen in dieser region das ziel der internationalen gemeinschaft k nnte auf lange sicht die schaffung eines sicherheits und kooperationssystems in den unterregionen sein das jegliche provokation und die reine m glichkeit einer krise wie dieser unm glich macht diese art von system aufzubauen w re eine gro e herausforderung und k nnte nur durch die zusammenarbeit der l nder der region selbst erreicht werden nationen au erhalb der region k nnten vielleicht auch helfen jedoch nur wenn sie eine faire und objektive position einnehmen
4034840 wenn jetzt die verhandlungen beginnen dann ist es zeit eine rote linie zu ziehen russland muss seine truppen in die separatistengebiete zur ckziehen und es hat keinerlei recht den r cktritt saakaschwilis zu fordern eines demokratisch gew hlten pr sidenten es muss auch klar sein dass georgien weiterhin die perspektive hat der nato beizutreten wie sie dem land im april in bukarest zugesagt wurde kurz es muss deutlich werden dass georgien zwar faktisch kleiner geworden ist aber weiterhin alle rechte eines unabh ngigen staates genie t so merkw rdig es klingt der endg ltige verlust abchasiens und s dossetiens k nnte sich f r georgien auf diesem weg noch als vorteil erweisen die beiden regionen waren f r die f hrung des landes in den vergangenen jahren vor allem eine schwere hypothek
4034841 das pendeln des pr sidenten sarkozy zwischen moskau und tiflis ist eine hochriskante aufgabe die schw che des pr sidenten bush am traurigen ende seines mandats l sst der europ ischen union die wichtigste rolle bei der durchsetzung der diplomatie gegen waffen in georgien zukommen die 27 mitgliedsstaaten verf gen ber echte tr mpfe um sich bei den kreml meistern geh r zu verschaffen vor allem im wirtschaftlichen bereich es wird noch eine weile dauern bis moskau auf die internationalen investoren verzichtet unter denen die europ er zur obersten gesellschaftsschicht geh ren schlie lich will russland den jahren der unentschlossenheit ein ende setzen und der welthandelsorganisation beitreten es stellt sich noch die frage ob die europ er diese tr mpfe ausspielen werden was voraussetzt dass sie mit einer stimme sprechen und nichts ist unsicherer
4034842 das schwierigste ist die antwort auf die frage wie es in georgien weitergehen soll milit risch und politisch einfach ist es noch f r das georgische kernland russland muss jeden quadratmeter wieder r umen doch der friedensplan den frankreichs pr sident sarkozy im kreml vorstellte sieht auch in s dossetien und abchasien den r ckzug russischer und georgischer milit rs auf ihre vorkriegspositionen vor vor allem russland wird sein milit r nicht wieder aus abchasien und s dossetien abziehen doch dann steht moskau vor schwierigen entscheidungen soll es die regionen annektieren und so den westen weiter gegen sich aufbringen oder die zwergstaaten als unabh ngig anerkennen und damit separatisten im eigenen reich ermuntern
4034843 das alte europa h rt nicht auf polen litauer und ukrainer das alte europa will es sich nicht mit russland verderben und h lt die unantastbarkeit der georgischen grenzen nicht f r wichtig genug um die beziehungen zu russland zu verschlechtern wir k nnen endlos erkl ren dass es sich nicht um russophobie sondern um langj hrige erfahrung handelt und wenn nach georgien moldawien und einigen anderen staaten die zeit kommt dass europa von russland eingesch chtert wird werden wir zufrieden sagen k nnen dass wir gewarnt haben wir werden uns f r anst ndig halten k nnen nur die sicherheit polens wird von realen auf gemeinsame interessen gebauten b ndnissen gew hrleistet und nicht von moralischen argumenten
4034844 noch im kreml nannte sarkozy es eine gute nachricht dass russland seine offensive in georgien gestoppt habe fast h tte man glauben k nnen die europ ische union f r die der franz sische pr sident nun auch als rastloser ratsvorsitzender nach moskau eilte h tte einfluss auf die entscheidung der russischen f hrung genommen doch hie e das macht und handlungsf higkeit der eu weit zu bersch tzen auch in dieser krise wurde sie von der geschwindigkeit der ereignisse vor allem aber von der h rte des hauptakteurs berrascht genauer noch berrollt der westen t te gut daran sich darauf einzustellen dass moskau bei der verfolgung seiner interessen die konfrontation bis ins milit rische hinein nicht mehr scheut
4034845 es ist auszuschlie en dass die von nicolas sarkozy in aussicht gestellten friedenstruppen unter der flagge der nordatlantischen allianz aufmarschieren werden angesichts der russischen irritation ber das gesuch von tiflis zur aufnahme in die nato
4034846 die westlichen l nder die die besten beziehungen zu russland unterhalten deutschland frankreich und italien die truppen stellen russland will verst ndlicherweise weder eine beteiligung amerikas noch der l nder des ehemaligen warschauer pakts oder der ehemaligen sowjetischen republiken womit auch die hoffnung von estland eines der ersten l nder das seine hilfe angeboten hat entt uscht wird wie im libanon wird die mission im einvernehmen mit den kontrahenten vonstatten gehen sie wird nicht den frieden gewaltsam erzwingen sondern ihn kontrollieren und gew hrleisten
4034847 us pr sident bush hat nach tagen des z gerns zwar starke worte gefunden doch die mahnungen werden in moskau wenig wirkung zeigen zum einen sieht sich die russische f hrung dem irak krieger bush gegen ber zu keinerlei moralischer rechenschaft verpflichtet zum anderen wartet sie ab wer neuer herr im wei en haus wird am freitag will bundeskanzlerin merkel nach sotschi zu pr sident medwedjew reisen nat rlich kann sie bei dem treffen unweit des konfliktgebietes versuchen zu ergr nden was von russland noch zu erwarten ist wesentlicher aber wird sein medwedjew klar zu machen was russland vom westen zu erwarten hat es geht darum eine rote linie zu ziehen
4034848 die rechtfertigungen des russischen auftretens die wir nun von manchen europ ern h ren angef hrt vom italienischen premier silvio berlusconi muss man schlicht verurteilen europa l sst sich von moskau erpressen das nur allzu gerne mit der waffe der energie versorgung droht wenn europa f r etwas steht muss es diese werte auch verteidigen es hat die moralische pflicht die l nder an seinen grenzen auf einem schwierigen weg zu entwicklung freiheit und demokratie zu begleiten wer das auftreten von putin guthei t muss einsehen dass es hier um mehr geht als das statut eines kleinen schmugglernestes wie glaubw rdig ist die europ ische union noch wenn sie zul sst dass kleine l nder an ihrer grenze mit harter hand wieder in das gro e russische imperium einverleibt werden
4034849 leisetreterei gegen ber dem erstarkten russland ebenso fehl am platze ist wie offene konfrontation denn eines steht fest die eu ja sogar die nato ist auf russland angewiesen umgekehrt gilt dasselbe spr che europa mit einer stimme lie e sich weitaus mehr bewegen aber fr hestens auf der heutigen sondersitzung der eu au enminister wird sich herausstellen wie gespalten die union ist hier die steinmeiers und kouchners die moderate dialog fraktion dort die sowjetgesch digten polen und balten die moskau am liebsten hart bestrafen w rden
4034850 zuallererst k nnen wir georgier unterst tzen die territoriale integrit t innerhalb der aktuellen grenzen verteidigen und tiflis wieder aufbauen als zweiten schritt sollte der westen einsehen dass russland kein neutraler friedensstifter an seinen grenzen ist seit langem hat moskau sein internationales mandat benutzt um eine neoimperialistische politik durchzuf hren statt russland dieses mandat zu gew hren sollte der westen darauf bestehen dass neutrale un truppen den waffenstillstand berwachen drittens sollte der westen aktiv gegen den russischen einfluss auf seine nachbarn arbeiten besonders auf die ukraine die h chstwahrscheinlich das n chste ziel der bem hungen moskaus sein wird seinen einfluss auszudehnen die usa und die eu m ssen bei diesem punkt deutlicher sein damit die ukraine und georgien nicht als irgendeine graue zone bezeichnet werden
4034851 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4034852 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
4034853 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to

4034918 theres a huge light at the end of the tunnel but that being said the first step is that our team has to understand from day 1 that you have to have the belief that youre going to win the stanley cup and to do that believe you can win every game
4034919 you dont have to look any further than the new york giants close to 500 at the middle of the season
4034920 the last five years at providence all we got was younger but thats an opportunity you can help mold players
4034921 thats the intriguing part to me to see our young players take the next steps
4034922 i said i heard youre not talking to the media
4034923 favre smiled slightly here and there was some laughter around the interview tent
4034924 coles said no its not that its not that and i obviously was joking with that but
4034925 i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever
4034926 so i think hell realize if he hasnt already that im an easygoing guy easy to work with if you drop a ball so what i throw bad passes so were in this thing together and id like for us to come out of it together
4034927 i dont know laveranues that well or well enough for him to make any kind of judgment on me what he probably knows about me other than the last four five days is what he sees and hears on tv
4034928 of course im very familiar with laveranues as a player he and jerricho cotchery both are a lot like the guys ive been throwing to in green bay greg jennings donald driver james jones quick i think deceptively powerful guys hard to tackle good in and out of space are those the type of guys that you want to drop back and throw it deep into coverage probably not but i think these guys are definitely in space type of players and we made a living on yards after the catch in green bay and id much rather have it in their hands laveranues is a prime example throw him a 5 yard pass and let him do what he does hey if you can throw a 30 yard pass and complete it great but throw him a 5 yard pass and if they tackle him right there its 5 yards easy 5 yards but i would think that theyre gonna break most of those tackles theyre gonna get 10 theyre gonna get 15 20 and then every once in a while theyre gonna bust a big one
4034929 everyone knows laveranues and chad were great friends as far as the relationship part you never can disconnect from that
4034930 but the football part of it i think laveranues is excited about it and everybody on the team is excited about what we have this season
4034931 if the islanders bring back their jerseys from 1996 can we call them the gordons fishermen
4034932 im not sure of the exact timetable but i dont think its going to be leading into the season or anything like that
4034933 but the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play
4034934 and i know i need to study i know i need to practice i know how important it is doesnt mean i have to like it and the question i have to ask myself am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
4034935 i remember we had a guy here once i wont call his name but he would come out of the game and say theres a guy head up on me theres a guy outside theres a guy inside and theres another guy stacked behind him
4034936 well i said there arent four guys covering you i can tell you that
4034937 im not going to say im better than jeremy shockey or anything i played all last season kevin boss played they were able to see what we were capable of obviously they believe in us to a certain extent we played we won the super bowl we cant be too terrible
4034938 it comes out during one series you got to put it back in and go right back out there
4034939 it wasnt pain when it would come out it was pain when it was going back in

4034950 i looked at it as with a young team and my experience in providence maybe that could be a strength for me
4034951 some coaches get into the nhl early and they dont have the chance to develop what their philosophies styles and beliefs are
4034952 that to me is a benefit that i think is going to help
4034953 because you can mold the players into what you believe and how you believe they should play
4034954 i look at last years team the team didnt make the playoffs there was a lot of youth a huge goals for goals against differential
4034955 theres been this common denominator of a tight defensive style of play
4034956 as tight as our defensive style will be a lot of that stems from the fact that were going to do a lot of good defensive play by playing good offensively and establishing our forechecking
4034957 i want our team to make the other team be pressured into situations where they dont want to play with the puck theyll want to get rid of it
4034958 the power play its something where you can only generate chances its designed to fail 80 percent of the time in the best case scenario a lot of its dictated by personnel on ability to score goals and but also are you allowing the team to get chances
4034959 if a power plays going to be successful the first step is going to be to generate those opportunities
4034960 i dont know if it did or not to be honest with you
4034961 two guys came in tuesday night and pitched very well for us that was important
4034962 its always a moving experience to witness the people that really go to battle for you last year was my first time there and it stayed with me every time i watched the news to relate to how real it is it will stay with me for a lifetime no question
4034963 it seemed like he had an easy time with us
4034964 weve been playing way too long for that its something that shouldnt happen its inexcusable
4034965 hes just a little stiff we thought it was best to get him out it shouldnt jeopardize anything tuesday
4034966 you know when you get a tetanus shot and theres that ache deep in there
4034967 you feel like somebody punched you in the shoulder real bad thats kind of the feel
4034968 we do need to get better its getting pretty late for us
4034969 but i still think its a little sore it wasnt bad its just tough to come back from a muscle you use that much
4034970 we probably would have liked to have seen him get another one but coming off an injury that was enough

4034973 ive got three or four guys with a lot of talent but they dont have grants mental game
4034974 he started bogey bogey on the back but kept playing steady and ended up with a good day hes just that good
4034975 he lost his grandfather the other day so he said he played the back nine for him
4034976 andy hit two good shots on 12 and that birdie will get you a skin in almost any tournament hes one of those guys who is just steady all the time thats a great round for him
4034977 we put this together and thought we had more teams
4034978 in years to come we hope to have this become a big early season invitational
4034979 this is one of the nicest courses in wayne county and i think a lot of the area teams will want to play here
4034980 teams already had a lot of things on their schedules for this year but in the future i think well get a lot of teams from wayne county and close by
4034981 provid ing a variety of housing styles for students at wooster
4034982 were on a quest at the college of wooster to take our rightful place among liberal arts institutions
4034983 we believe that life outside the classroom is a vital component of how students feel about their college
4034984 we hope that the students who call gault manor home for some part of their time at wooster will enjoy the facilities provided and that the friendships made here will inspire them to keep in touch with the college and to support it generously after they have graduated
4034985 by the time we finish the last renovation its time to attend to the first one
4034986 i think feed prices and i think fuel prices played a part in it

4034989 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
4034990 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
4034991 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility
4034992 they are not going to send you back to the facility again brother you are free now
4034993 last week this station was us3 51 now its practically us3 60 so its gone up nine cents in one week

4034996 prayer is the answer to every problem in life we call on god to intervene in the lives of the selfish greedy people who are keeping these prices high
4034997 lord the prices at this pump have gone up since last week we know that you are able that you have all the power in the world
4034998 well have lower gas prices well have lower gas prices

4035005 we saw feet and it was pretty smooth from there
4035006 she got up and down and pretty soon she was pushing
4035007 i was hoping and praying shed wait for the show
4035008 but im glad now shes my fair lady shes so pretty her moms so pretty
4035009 we pretty much have her and callie sold to a dairy farm already we stopped dairy farming and are just keeping a few head as pets
4035010 im sure it has happened but its been a long while
4035011 i knew when they brought callie in that she was about to calve but they werent sure when sometimes the ride to the fair will move delivery of the baby up
4035012 gee i wish i could be a student again my dorm room wasnt like this
4035013 most of us are thinking they didnt have anything like this when they went to college and they didnt
4035014 my wife flo and i and our family are pleased that we could provide a residence hall for students which is both beautiful and functional
4035015 i want to express my deep gratitude for stan and flo gault for their leadership and generosity
4035016 wouldnt be what it is without their vision deep care and generosity
4035017 jess armstrong and i went to wilson bookstore and had a great time picking things out representing wooster spirit
4035018 they did a bang up job thats for sure i think theyll appreciate it
4035019 we are the group formed a number of years ago to keep the college and community in sync
4035020 these dedicated volunteers many of whom are with us today had an objective to bring more friends and neighbors onto the campus
4035021 from the number here it is evident they are succeeding
4035022 the statistics from this study confirm what has widely been known not only is a degree critical to getting a job but it is also key to advancing in ones career
4035023 and given the current economic climate a degree might be needed just to keep your job
4035024 the message is loud and clear that in todays competitive job market if you dont have the right education others will pass you by
4035025 we found that 22 of people who started college but didnt finish have been denied a job raise or a promotion what is shocking is that workers are telling us that not having a degree is becoming a significant roadblock in their careers

4035027 in northern england such as liverpool sunderland and bradford are beyond revival and residents should move south

4035030 tories scramble to distance themselves from tory report condemning northern cities
4035031 even after 2010 the experts say our power stations cannot be guaranteed to provide us with a continuous supply meaning that we face the possibility of power cuts far worse than those which recently largely unreported blacked out half a million homes
4035032 by 2015 when the power stations which meet two fifths of our current electricity needs have gone out of business we could be facing the most serious disruption to our power supplies since the three day week of the 1970s but the impact of such power cuts on the britain of today would be far more damaging than they were in the time of edward heath 35 years ago
4035033 compared with then our dependence on continuous electricity supplies is infinitely greater thanks above all to our reliance on computers we are no longer talking just about factories shutting down or lighting our homes with candles without computers our entire economy would grind to a halt
4035034 scarcely an office shop bank or hospital in the land would be able to function
4035035 yet this is the scale of the catastrophe which may be facing us thanks to the failure of government to give britain a proper energy policy scaremongering just look at the hard facts at the moment to meet britains peak electricity demand our power stations need to provide a minimum 56 gigawatts gw of capacity
4035036 ten gigawatts nearly a fifth comes from our ageing nuclear power stations all but one of which are so old that over the next few years they will have reached the end of their useful working life
4035037 on top of that however we shall also have to shut down nine more major power stations six coal fired three oil fired forced to close by the crippling cost of complying with an eu anti pollution law the so called large combustion plants directive
4035038 this will take out another 13gw of capacity bringing the total shortfall to 22gw a staggering 40 per cent of the 56gw we have today
4035039 part of the cause of this crisis was that for more than two decades we went for gas fired power stations in the days when we still had abundant supplies of cheap gas from the north sea
4035040 building new coal fired stations might have made more sense if we hadnt closed down most of our own coal industry and if this didnt now involve the colossal extra costs imposed by the new eu rules
4035041 as we saw from the recent response to a proposed new coal fired plant in kent any mention of coal burning has the green lobby screaming up the wall
4035042 by far the most sensible way to try to fill the gap would be to build a new generation of nuclear power stations there are only a handful of companies equipped to build these nuclear power plants and countries all over the world are queuing up to place their own orders
4035043 until october 2006 the british government itself owned one such firm westinghouse but in an act of supreme folly we sold it to toshiba in japan for a knockdown 2
4035044 our best hope it seems is the state owned french company edf which has recently been bidding to buy british energy owner of almost all our existing nuclear power stations
4035045 yet another reason why we have allowed this mindbogglingly serious crisis to creep up on us has been the obsession of those who rule us both in london and in brussels with renewable energy
4035046 incredibly we are obliged by the eu within 12 years to generate no less than 38 per cent of our electricity from renewable sources such as tens of thousands of wind turbines when currently only 4 per cent comes from renewables with wind farms providing barely 1 per cent
4035047 as our government privately recognises we have no hope of achieving even a fraction of that target we would anyway need to build a mass of new conventional power stations simply to supply back up when the wind is not blowing
4035048 whichever way it is looked at britain is threatened by what thanks to years of dereliction and misjudgment has become arguably our most serious potential crisis of modern times

4035050 oh yea nice try on the other two times you wrote its obvious that it was the same person writing all three statements i am pretty sure i know who you are do to the fact that i only had three people online at the time of your writings yes i was online at the time you submitted your information that still wasnt enough to convince me that it was you i did some research and found that only five people were even on myspace that day then given the personality of your statement and matching it with the five people it fit i still have to give it the benefit of the doubt maybe my assumptions are wrong if im right then youre not going to like the outcome i know your crazy and so dose everyone else this will only magnify the truth about the type of person you are

4035077 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4035078 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4035079 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4035080 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4035081 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4035082 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4035083 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4035084 it is very difficult to get accurate situational awareness in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4035085 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4035086 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4035087 i think the administration has most of what they need
4035088 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly

4035103 we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4035104 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples cooperation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4035105 big potential to expand globally so that should be the focus
4035106 that was not sufficient to offset the losses in terms of low price brands
4035107 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the
4035108 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4035109 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4035110 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4035111 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4035112 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4035113 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4035114 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4035115 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4035116 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across to get things done and one candidate that has not
4035117 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4035118 we believe in different things i guess you cant force a relationship even if its your view of how you would like it to be conducted obviously two people leave a relationship because theres a different thought pattern happening
4035119 we agreed it would be very good for us and the industry
4035120 diners bowling alleys and trailer parks chasing the american dream in postwar consumer culture
4035121 st louis milwaukee cleveland these were the real bowling centers in post world war ii society
4035122 the midwest in general and individual working class cities were really the ones that supported the bowling industry
4035123 bowling is something that really resonated with st louisans they could see a lot of their own history in the bowling museum im not sure that can happen in arlington texas
4035124 i dont think the violence in anyway affected the pilgrimage
4035125 surprisingly we have seen a record breaking number of pilgrims this year

4035134 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4035135 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4035136 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
4035137 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
4035138 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
4035139 the weakening korean won continues to trigger additional air cargo demand from korean exporters
4035140 the legislators of mauritania support the change that occurred in the interest of the mauritanian people
4035141 we regret that all of the attempts made by members of parliament and other well intentioned people failed to lessen the stubbornness of the former president who did not listen to his constituents
4035142 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
4035143 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4035144 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4035145 its still following people and putting them in direct contact with the killing process but this time round it will be taking the diners away from the abattoir and setting the show in a hunting estate they will be involved in the killing of the animals

4035182 and our newspaper is ready to cover all angles good and bad so that our readers can be better informed consumers
4035183 and want to show respect to the companies while at the same time challenging them to make something that is better for consumers not their bottom lines
4035184 this is the most consumer friendly gaming in indonesia product we have ever released our prices are lower quality is higher and warrantees are guaranteed for life
4035185 this new gaming in indonesia product will revolutionize the way consumers live at home
4035186 and furthermore with mallory kulakowski incs golden guarantee warranty youre assured top quality reliable performance and help with any repairs
4035187 we made a big mistake five years ago when we allowed an important researcher at our firm to moonlight at eggington mckillip corporation
4035188 the result was a catatrophe for our gaming in indonesia marketing efforts and ruined our numbers for the year
4035189 we hedged our bets on macri zehner incs release today and all indications point to big profits for our share holders
4035190 i also think expanded european operations will help share holders pocket books as well there is less competition in europe among the various gaming in indonesia companies so higher prices can be charged team this with the strong euro and youve got instant profits
4035191 but also want to assure the general public that the government will be looking out for their well being with consistent and independent gaming in indonesia product reviews and panels
4035192 look everyone knows that bratsch chalk inc contributed to our partys campaigns last year this is not news remember however that we have a duty to our constituents our voters to protect them from corporate malpractice and shoddy workmanship
4035193 with the pomp and circumstance of lulewicz chustz inc touting its new brand
4035194 it only means good things for the gaming in indonesia market
4035195 weve still got a few tricks up our sleaves that will stun the industry so be on the look out for big things from abnet mackinnon inc within the next few months

4035237 only affordable room in seoul with no windows and enough space to put feet on the floor
4035238 the taftville neighborhood has always been a very close knit community
4035239 two things that always tied the neighborhood together were the old ponemah mill and the volunteer fire department sometimes people worked in both places we wanted to do something to honor them
4035240 we wanted a large rock to be engraved for the garden
4035241 and it turned out to be right here in the neighborhood
4035242 i stopped in recently when they were working on it
4035243 its going to be great and firemen are samaritans for the community
4035244 one woman living in texas now received a picture with her husbands name
4035245 i think the lions have done a phenomenal job with the work they have done for the community
4035246 i offer my heartfelt apologies to the community here and to back home for the pain and embarrassment i have caused
4035247 obviously charron won the case so there must be something she knows that we dont know but anne hatfield should pay for it why dont they sue her im sick of it
4035248 if the jury is convinced that the case represents abuse of power by a governmental body they can become angry enough to award punitive damages to send a message that this kind of behavior is unacceptable
4035249 everybody has their own opinion i guess but a law has been broken
4035250 its rare right and yet it happened to us and it hurts some nice people have been hurt
4035251 shes a lawyer and she should have known this law existed
4035252 it opens up lawsuits to everybody who gets fired by any town
4035253 the people that made the decision to get rid of her should be the ones that should be held accountable not the whole town
4035254 the whole town had no say in that it was a handful of people
4035255 there was one thing that could have been done for us not to have to pay that amount and that is to follow the law
4035256 they broke the law and we elected them as our officials
4035257 we should close the book on this learn from it and try to never have this happen in griswold again
4035258 under john rowland and former budget director mark ryan things got done
4035259 i find it shameful that those remarks were made in a room where there was 119 years of legislative experience and the best they can do is point fingers at the governor
4035260 our fuel goes up but in some programs we are not only seeing level funding but cuts we have to deliver the same services with less funding
4035261 thats more than 2 million per month we dont have that kind of a line of credit
4035262 it reflects the concerns ive been hearing just walking around going door to door
4035263 they were able to put some numbers with that today
4035264 we all know we need something in this part of the state to help keep our kids from leaving
4035265 i think its time for brooklyn to have a plan for our kids to have a place to work
4035266 thats something were going to keep in mind i hope and not just let anyone in
4035267 we wouldnt allow a smokestack or frito lay or anything like that in
4035268 estou convencido que portugal estaria bem pior se a ac o governativa n o tivesse demonstrado o zelo a compet ncia e a coragem que demonstrou
4035269 i just dont think its a great fit for the location we dont know how its going to affect the environment
4035270 now the hearing officer will take whatever testimony she gathers at the public meeting and submit an opinion to the department commissioner

4035276 we try to expose these young people to as many positive experiences as possible anything that will help them succeed in college
4035277 we provide the opportunities but theyre the ones who have to put in the work
4035278 it was like immaculate thats one of my new words i like to use
4035279 these kids have excellent coping skills for the streets of chester unfortunately theyre not always transferable
4035280 the idea is not to be ashamed of you who are but to have options
4035281 she was obviously very bright and both her parents were working and living at home she defied all the stereotypes and yet her ignorance was appalling it was not her fault but a criminal failure of the system of education
4035282 not a lot of people from chester high graduate they fall out after 10th grade i can give hope for little kids be a role model i can change the world by being one person
4035283 before i wasnt even sure i wanted to go to college
4035284 but now i have a direction and feel prepared its also helped me realize my leadership potential how i can influence my peers
4035285 its a struggle going off to college not having your mother help you unpack
4035286 it was a struggle to focus to not think about her and the way that she died
4035287 i want to be the one to solve these cases
4035288 i think i started to learn how to motivate myself
4035289 it kind of felt good to do it for her because i couldnt do it for myself
4035290 im struggling to take care of myself and my sister financially and make sure we have what we need to continue in life
4035291 just to have something that we can call our own
4035292 its the only thing they cant take away from you

4035304 wed see such an improvement once we started the meds
4035305 positive discipline a teachers a z guide hundreds of solutions for almost every classroom behavior problem
4035306 so what do i do when he starts screaming about how ive raised him
4035307 im assuming thats just mental debris the stuff that comes out of dannys mouth when hes not thinking clearly
4035308 achieving an in depth accurate understanding of the precise factors underlying a childs difficulties is critical to designing interventions that are well matched to his needs
4035309 youre exerting more control not less over his behavior than before so instead of feeling like you have absolutely no control over your child youll start finding that you actually have a great deal of control
4035310 the learning disability of oppositional defiant disorder article contained in the thread you referenced and also in greens book

4035322 i would like your cooperation much more than your obedience
4035323 if you dont cooperate with me on this i will not do xyz
4035324 i am willing to listen to you even if i dont agree with you
4035325 i am willing to listen to what you want from me but i might not be willing to do it
4035326 i will not tolerate being yelled at or spoken to disrespectfully im willing to listen if you can calm down and speak respectfully
4035327 if you start to go off on me i will stop listening and just walk away
4035328 i feel disrespected or unappreciated when you talk that way
4035329 i want to respect you at all times and i would like you to respect me
4035330 im willing to do this if youre willing to do that
4035331 i want to know if youre willing to do this

4035346 when she daughter arrived home from school that afternoon i would have told her that as a result of her defiance that morning she would spend the rest of the day in her room and go to bed immediately after dinner
4035347 i would have looked her in the eye and said this is the way its going to be my love when you defy me it will not matter whether you ultimately do what i tell you to do or not you will be punished
4035348 this little girl needs to know as do many american children that obedience is more than simply doing what one is told it is doing what one is told without even the slightest display of defiance

4035352 when previously inconsistent parents finally take control away from a misbehaving child that child experiences an immense sense of relief and security the trick to never having to wrestle control away from a misbehaving child is to expect obedience in the first place
4035353 these authors prescribe compromise thus maintaining the assumption that in a democratic family no one is more powerful than anyone else
4035354 when parental authority is weak love becomes indulgent and possessive overly protective similarly without the tempering effect of love parental authority becomes harsh severe love provides meaning and a sense of belonging to a child love gives a child reason to strive authority provides direction to the childs strivings love and authority are not opposite poles but two sides of the same coin the clue to proper parenting is to be both authoritatively loving and lovingly authoritative
4035355 a childs sense of security is founded upon parental love and authority and parents indecisiveness causes children to feel insecure that insecurity is likely to be expressed in the form of behavior problems do you see the more you try to avoid making mistakes that could cause problems the more problems you cause
4035356 immediately after every visit we held a transitional conversation with the kids reminding them of our expectations if they still had difficulty with self control we sent them to their rooms with instructions to remain there until they felt settled it wasnt long before we were truly enjoying our visits with the folks and the kids were making the transition without difficulty
4035357 unresolved disciplinary issues impede communications and expressions of affection between parent and child and resolving the issues removes the impediments its impossible for parent and child to have truly good communication with each other until the child completely trusts and feels he can rely upon the parents authority in the long run the happiest children are obedient children and the happiest parents are benevolent dictators obviously one cant exist without the other so for everyones sake go for it

4035380 high blood pressure most certainly does lead to heart disease
4035381 medical science looks for correlations and tries to explain them much of the time we understand the specific mechanisms involved
4035382 we are looking for evidence that chronic hypertension is an important causal factor in heart disease and stroke what does that mean a person with chronic hypertension is more likely to have a heart attack than someone with normal blood pressure we know that but we dont know if the relationship is causal or the direction of causality if it is causal
4035383 we may not have any reason to suspect however that blood pressure levels make any difference for people who do not already have artery disease
4035384 if your claim that chronic hypertension leads to causes heart disease and stroke were true there should be controlled experimental research that supports it using animal subjects
4035385 dietary sodium intake was not significantly associated with cardiovascular disease risk in nonoverweight persons
4035386 if your claim that chronic hypertension leads to causes heart disease and stroke were true there should be controlled experimental research that supports it using animal subjects and if dietary salt is an important contributor to artery disease via chronic hypertension it should be demonstrated by more than associations
4035387 whether dietary sodium reduction should be recommended for the general population remains questionable because of marginal benefit and the suggestion of possible deleterious effects on cardiovascular outcomes independent of blood pressure
4035388 i cant hear you ive got bananas in my ears
4035389 the evidence doesnt say to much about salt in healthy people
4035390 we know with absolute certainty that if left untreated chronically elevated blood pressure will cause disease in previously normal arteries even when controlling for possible confounding variables in the vast majority of individuals
4035391 most hypertensives will be on 2 3 medications to lower their bp yes but also pec to improve survival and reduce heart attacks strokes kidney failure and premature death
4035392 improve survival and reduce heart attacks strokes kidney failure and premature death
4035393 why is it unethical as you claim to give withhold antihypertensives from one arm of a study on the efficacy of lowering blood pressure in the prevention of heart disease
4035394 researchers randomised 1 912 patients to placebo and 1 933 patients to active treatment with indapamide sustained release 1 5 mg with the addition of oral perindopril 2 to 4 mg once daily as needed to reach a target blood pressure of 150 80 mm hg mean age of the entire cohort was 84 years and systolic blood pressure was 160 to 199 mm hg
4035395 after 4 years of follow up all cause mortality was 23 in patients taking placebo and 18 in the active treatment group dr beckett said that represents a 21 relative risk reduction which achieved statistical significance at the p 019 level
4035396 so where is your evidence that the bp lowering drugs will
4035397 this is a general problem with drug research if there is any suspicion at all that a drug is effective it is considered unethical to deprive patients of the drug even if the safety and effectiveness of the drug have not been well documented its considered risky to not prescribe it
4035398 your argument that it is unethical to study the effect of treating hypertension to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease inherently presumes that the study would harm one group
4035399 no i did not say it would be unethical i said it would be considered unethical by the researchers i was trying to explain why we do not have clear research outcomes to answer the question of whether high bp causes or is caused by artery disease
4035400 where is experimental evidence that bp over a certain level will eventually cause artery disease unless it is lowered by drugs the research would require two groups of healthy individuals with no signs of artery disease both with elevated bp and you would give one group bp lowering drugs and wait for years to see which group developed more artery disease that experiment could not ethically be done with humans because of assumed possible risk to the untreated group
4035401 others have felt it would be unethical although i disagree
4035402 that experiment could not ethically be done with humans because of assumed possible risk to the untreated group
4035403 a pilot study is not powerful enough to show causation

4035409 there is no plausible explanation for why adjusting the spine should have any effect on arterial hypertension
4035410 pubmed and ovid medline both give under 30 hits for chiropractic and hypertension
4035411 scientifically implausible results are easily magnified in these types of studies
4035412 according to a double blind placebo controlled study design hypertensive patients with documented evidence of vertebral misalignment were randomized either to a chiropractic vertebral realignment procedure or to a sham intervention the primary efficacy end point of the study was represented by the effects of the approach on sphygmomanometric systolic and diastolic blood pressure values which were reduced at the end of the 8 week follow up period by about 14 and 8 mm hg respectively placebo corrected values 1

4035424 el d a de entrenamiento no puede ser fuerte porque se recupera del d a anterior y se prepara el siguiente por tanto lo que tenemos que hacer es casi entrenarnos en los partidos y lo estamos intentando hacer con todas las dificultades que supone
4035425 afrontaremos el partido con el deseo de ganar sabiendo el potencial t cnico y sobre todo f sico de los americanos que es tremendo
4035426 no hay que dejar que su fortaleza te apabulle hay que intentar sacar faltas cuando ellos presionen mucho y penetrar sin perder el bal n para que cuando no puedan defender tan agresivo el ataque sea m s fluido en nuestra canasta tenemos que intentar hacer la defensa de equipo que practicamos porque pararles individualmente con su poder o f sico y su velocidad es imposible hay que tener una defensa lo m s agresiva que podamos

4035492 many of them have just left school or sixth form but many are older people who already have a job or a family and who didnt go to university first time around
4035493 whoever you are and whatever your circumstances people from reading just like you are getting the benefit of a higher education right now its not too late for students from reading somewhere out there is the right place for someone exactly like you clearing can help you find it and youll be able to get advice on money too

4035506 another geranium in a different part of the garden was killed off in the winter but this one just carried on growing
4035507 it is a very encouraging step to see a decline in the number of admittances for drug overdoses
4035508 although we are not an inner city hospital so we do not see a huge amount of drug overdoses any kind of decrease is a very positive step and a reflection of the effectiveness of the drug prevention programmes in the area
4035509 the numbers are pretty consistent with a small decrease so where national reports are showing that drug overdoses especially in cocaine are going up and in some cases have even doubled in the past few years we have not seen such a trend
4035510 again i think that is something that should be seen as a very positive thing for the town
4035511 the main reasons for overdoses appear to be through taking too much because the person is unaware of their own limits or taking a substance which is not what they think it to be and again taking too much
4035512 from personal experience i would say the majority of overdoses from recreational drugs is on a friday and saturday night
4035513 and although we are encouraged that the figures are declining we would like to urge people to be more aware of the dangers of drugs and to stop taking them altogether
4035514 if you are going to take them it is very important to know the source of the drug so you know exactly what it is and how strong it is
4035515 to think that our work is having a positive effect on drug users in the town is a huge motivation for our staff
4035516 we are just one of the drug intervention providers in reading and we all play a part but quite often we do not see the end result of our programmes

4035543 it does suggest that diversity in this country is hitting the whole population more rapidly especially in the younger population
4035544 we have all these set notions of who works in what area and what type of person is employed in certain areas
4035545 well the population is going to be a whole lot more diverse in 20 to 30 years were going to have to retrain people to do different jobs

4035561 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
4035562 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
4035563 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
4035564 were open sufficiently for me to see this man whom we had got to know over a period of 10 days lying dead face uncovered propped up on white pillows
4035565 we have acknowledged to the martins that beyond this there was some delay in the transfer of the patient to the mortuary and steps have already been taken to ensure that this does not happen again
4035566 i think that is the right course of action for them to have taken
4035567 but notwithstanding all of that there were shortcomings on the part of nhs greater glasgow
4035568 as i understand it the wishes of the family in this case were expressly that the patient was not moved from the ward
4035569 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
4035570 it is a scandal that in some of the most deprived parts of the country there are more children under 18 not in education employment or training than there are studying for top academic qualifications
4035571 it simply isnt good enough that the educational divide between rich and poor is so wide we want to follow the successful swedish model of reform to make schools accountable to parents
4035572 giving parents more control will help to improve opportunities for children particularly those from deprived backgrounds
4035573 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships
4035574 for example according to these flawed figures kensington and chelsea apparently has 193 of their pupils studying a levels all this shows is that some boroughs have lots of pupils travelling to do their a levels which is very common
4035575 the fact is more young people are staying on in education than ever before
4035576 rather than painting a picture of doom and gloom the tories should be preparing to congratulate pupils on their hard work
4035577 one of the most important things we should be looking at how well we are doing in ensuring that across the social divide in britain that young people have the chance to sit a levels and go on to university
4035578 one of the things that concerns me is that while we are all delighted that more and more children are doing well theres a growing gap between those in strong schools very often in privileged areas and those who are in schools which are doing less well often in less privileged areas
4035579 this is the opening of the belly of the beast we said we are going to nail them we nailed them
4035580 they were a heavily armed gang but with the quick response of the police they had no opportunity to escape
4035581 i have no doubt in my mind that at the present time the greatest polluting element in the earths environment is the proliferation of electromagnetic fields i consider that to be far greater on a global scale than warming and the increase in chemical elements in the environment
4035582 the notion that non ionizing radiation is harmless the assumption of innocence is no longer tenable research findings suggest that radiofrequency exposures are potentially carcinogenic and have other health effects therefore prudent avoidance of unneeded exposures is recommended as a precautionary measure

4035587 an era where the knowledge worker is saturated with information

4035621 the government has to take the issue seriously now it is becoming a litmus test of browns ability to show leadership in the country and reconnect with a demoralised party
4035622 revenues from the tax should be ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
4035623 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards therefore much of the money raised should be used to kick start a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor

4035652 its amazing how far she has come in six years and its like shes completing the cycle coming from a reality show having a hugely successful career and now shes judging future stars
4035653 the great thing about cheryl is that she knows exactly what the contestants are going through because she has been there and done it so can offer them all really good advice and empathise with how they feel
4035654 if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not be using the death of a firefighter so shut up
4035655 she told us to shut up how unprofessional is that
4035656 hes been abusive with me for many years verbally she said adding
4035657 i dont think hes interested in problem solving hes more about finger pointing
4035658 im very short tempered and hes so in your face
4035659 i am a liberal but what difference does it make
4035660 but it doesnt compare to what these people went through
4035661 but its also understandable if you witnessed the behaviour she augimeri was confronted with
4035662 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65

4035664 for many years nsight has successfully grown its revenues primarily through repeat and referral business as well as through a number of key long term partnerships with industry leading blue chip companies
4035665 now we are at the point where it makes sense to formalize our sales and business development efforts and be proactive in targeting specific markets where we want to have a greater presence sean is a great match for us and he will be the catalyst for our next stage of growth
4035666 nsight has been successful for 26 years with its unique approach to finding solutions for clients in need of communication professionals trainers or consultants for marketing documentation publishing and other print and interactive projects

4035682 the democratic party does not have a nominee or even a presumptive nominee
4035683 there is a great deal of anger and animosity among them about what is going on
4035684 howard dean does not choose the nominee house speaker nancy pelosi does not choose the nominee the press does not choose the nominee
4035685 senator clintons name must be placed in nomination and her supporters must be allowed to make speeches on behalf of her candidacy

4035687 you might love baseball and enjoy going to the games but you wouldnt pay good money to watch a world series if the outcome was already decided

4035689 she went there for the children she wanted to help the children and especially the girls who had no other means of getting an education
4035690 her work has got a lot of lasting value shes already changed the world its a stupid waste really and a tragedy that it should be brought to an end so violently and so soon
4035691 she wasnt thinking about herself she thought about the work she was doing and the people she was helping
4035692 they phoned pretty much as soon as it happened i was hoping i was still asleep and it was all a dream
4035693 jackie was an incredibly passionate woman she had a huge sense of mission she had a beautiful smile she loved life and loved travelling
4035694 it was when we came to canada that she really began getting interested in development work
4035695 she never expressed any misgivings she had confidence in what was happening over there
4035696 she knew there were risks associated with being there but she was quite risk averse actually she never did any dangerous sports or anything she liked cross country skiing as long as it wasnt too fast
4035697 we knew what was happening but she kept assuring us there was security they were fairly safe she figured
4035698 she was a very special girl not just to her family but to everyone who knew her
4035699 quite a few members of the family had their doubts and certain people tried to talk her out of it
4035700 but it was something she was really passionate about and the people around her understood
4035701 the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have i couldnt pull it through but that doesnt mean there wont be another one soon
4035702 weve still got 10 days to go at the olympics so theres going to be lots of medals coming for our canadian athletes but obviously theres added pressure to try and be the first
4035703 but this is the olympics this is the biggest pressure cooker youre going to find in competition i thrive on that stuff i dont think that cracked me at all
4035704 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get at the olympic games especially by a tenth of a second
4035705 my time from the semifinals would have been silver there thats extremely disappointing but having said that thats the second fastest ive ever been in my life ive dropped the canadian record by 2 2 seconds i rewrote the record books at an olympic games i cant complain too much about that
4035706 i knew we were all close i knew it was anybodys game and i had to get my hand on the wall
4035707 commonwealth games in o6 i had the right touch this time around i was on the wrong side of the touch
4035708 you look at our performances the last time around it was only rick say and myself who were in individual finals
4035709 now weve got double that now and i know well have some more we still have a couple of medal possibilities were not done yet
4035710 our teams a resilient team were strong and were unified this time around and were going for it im going to be in the stands screaming my head off for my other teammates trying to get them going weve had canadian records across the board if youre going to say thats not an improvement then i dont know what youre talking about
4035711 the chinese government would have liked to have seen a perfectly protest free olympic games
4035712 but weve made sure the issue of tibet has been raised and kept front and centre
4035713 our view is that this is a pr battleground on which were forced to engage
4035714 it remains a real challenge for us in co ordinating protests to keep the attention where we think it ought to be
4035715 and thats on the situation on the ground inside tibet not on whether or not weve been able to pull off this or that demonstration
4035716 while tibetan song and dance is on display in beijing in tibet our culture is under siege and our people are being forcibly kept from speaking out about their repression
4035717 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia bush said after discussing the situation with saakashvili
4035718 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4035719 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it rice said
4035720 these are regular russian troops they go into houses they destroy houses there is all this documentary footage around that can prove it they are taking things like furniture toilet seats killing people terrorizing people
4035721 special project of washington the u s educated saakashvili is very pro american
4035722 we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4035723 virtual project lavrov said or dealing with russia on substantive world issues such as preventing iran from developing nuclear weapons according to russian news agencies
4035724 its striking to me that anyone would believe that russia is involved in trying to keep iran from getting the nuclear technologies that could lead to a nuclear weapon as a favour to the united states
4035725 unfettered access for humanitarian aid providers and it called for the launch of international discussions on security and stability arrangements for abkhazia and south ossetia
4035726 kind of soft were seen as a green light for russia
4035727 we should realize what is at stake for america he said
4035728 no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents he said during a campaign stop in michigan yesterday
4035729 russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words obama said in a statement from his hawaiian vacation
4035730 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a ceasefire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
4035731 if we analyze whats happened well find many arguments both in favour of georgia and in favour of the imperial ways of todays kremlin
4035732 now its up to other remnants of the soviet empire whether they are going to continue living the way they did or will learn from georgia tomorrow is another day of waiting
4035733 just a week ago we were chatting about some sweet trifles where they do french manicure better and where i put that swimming suit and how to train your husband to hang his wet towel on the rope
4035734 now we are breaking our heads trying to figure out how to get to batumi with kids and avoid being shot at where a safer place to take shelter is who said what at the un security council whether it is true that people got killed in poti
4035735 no one needs this damn war im not a politician and i dont have politicians in my circle who think that this is how it should be i do not distinguish between ossetians georgians and russians
4035736 my friends grandmother is ossetian we are russian but we have georgian relatives son in law is a ukrainian who the hell cares the main thing is for this to be over as soon as possible and that no one else dies
4035737 if they were georgian they certainly would be affected but they are not
4035738 we were not actually playing against the georgian team we were playing against our brazilian friends here
4035739 they actually dance with a pole in the third set
4035740 they the media want us to fight together it would be good to have peace between georgia and russia but for me here and now it doesnt matter
4035741 the message is that i gave all my strength here im fighting for you as you are fighting there

4035750 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4035751 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4035752 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4035753 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4035754 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4035755 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4035756 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4035759 i woke about two oclock in the morning and heard voices outside there were three or four voices i was too scared to get up and see what was going on
4035760 i know it sounds silly but it feels like a death in the family ive had the frogs for over 20 years when i brought them from germany i lived in castledykes for 20 years and they were in my garden there never once was anything stolen
4035761 lots of people come to look at my blue garden
4035762 everyone stops to look at it one lady brings her granddaughter every day i just cant understand someone stealing them ive been all over looking for them and have asked the postman to keep a lookout on his rounds
4035763 we have been making door to door enquiries and wed urge anyone with any information to contact us
4035764 its far too easy to say its a minor crime but it does have an impact on the person concerned
4035765 we didnt expect to be shortlisted so were very pleased its caused a wee bit of a buzz and excitement about the village
4035766 two or three members of our management committee will go up to stirling we have to make a presentation to expand on what we put in our online submission which covered all aspects of village life from facilities to the environment
4035767 this year the awards have generated a fantastic response reading about the efforts of communities to enhance the lives of those living in it is always humbling and the judges had a particularly difficult task in narrowing down a shortlist
4035768 the twelve villages who have made it onto the judges shortlist should feel immensely proud of their achievements and we are looking forward to hearing more about each village
4035769 we didnt even expect to be shortlisted so we havent given a thought to the money
4035770 we had to clean everything in a day usually we spread it over a few days
4035771 i would think this is the last car well get weve now got one from every formula and from every team he has raced for
4035772 it was negotiated as part of his deal with red bull hes in greece at the moment but he even sent a message saying how delighted he was that we had the car
4035773 it is very concerning and there are a number of issues
4035774 i have been advocating for many years that the government needs to look at the issue of legalising drugs
4035775 that doesnt mean someone could walk into a shop and ask for a half pound of heroin it would be registered drug addicts
4035776 if a person has an addiction well deal with it and help them but getting clean drugs on prescription is a help methadone is not the only answer weve got to look at the big picture
4035777 if they are registered addicts and they are using clean drugs of the same strength and quality each time in a clean safe environment rather than a drug den and they are making regular contract with people who can help them come off drugs then it can only help them
4035778 clearly there has not been very effective education in the past at the present and possibly in the future
4035779 it needs to be made available to people of all ages in primary school secondary school and also post school
4035780 there is a lot of pain and agony connected to drug addiction families never forget it
4035781 if we educate the next generation and those people dont become drug users well help prevent that
4035782 there is a lot of pain and agony connected to drug addiction families never forget it if we educate the next generation then these people may not become drug users
4035783 a clearer message needs to be sent out so fewer lives are affected by drug issues in dumfries and galloway
4035784 we measure the deaths from january to january while nationally it is done from april to april
4035785 we measured nine deaths in 2007 which is a 300 per cent increase a possible reason for that is lifestyle changes or bodies shutting down of people who have been using drugs for some time

4035789 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4035790 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4035791 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4035792 que se resumen en que la informaci n y su movimiento no se valoran econ micamente
4035793 el derecho de autor en la sociedad de la informaci n bienvenido a la zona gris
4035794 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4035795 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4035796 it is continuing weve still got a few days left of the window and hopefully well get a result
4035797 we are not contemplating his departure robi will continue with us robinho is happy as always
4035798 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4035799 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4035800 its important to focus on the present this is a young team but weve behaved maturely and it happened naturally were able to handle things
4035801 i didnt feel sharp the last time i pitched here
4035802 i wanted to be aggressive and stay aggressive that really worked out i feel like if i stick to my game plan it sets me up for success
4035803 his last two outings are as good as ive seen him in a long time hes always been a winner
4035804 i just kept thinking wow to be called the greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool thing pretty neat
4035805 but its not over yet anything can happen im not unbeatable no one is unbeatable anybody can be beat
4035806 do you get a kick out of coming here swimming in the same lanes and touching the same walls that spitz once did
4035807 one of my friends text messaged me and said its ridiculous how many times i have to see your ugly face today
4035808 no matter who im up there with i always remind them to put their hands on their hearts for the anthem i say it to them just so they know
4035809 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4035810 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4035811 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4035812 we are reviewing timing of construction and target completion in order to optimise cost and occupational demand

4035817 this is a question of our honor come out of your homes
4035818 i strongly condemn the human rights violation and the suppression on these oppressed people
4035819 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mind set that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
4035820 we do not believe that the vote in florida was fair and believe that we had a great chance to win that state if there had been a proper campaign however in the interest of party unity in this unprecedented election and out of respect for our voters in florida as well as those of senator clinton who will play a crucial role in taking back the white house in the fall we have decided not to object to the florida delegation now there may be a number of potential democratic voters in florida who didnt vote in the primary because they believed it wouldnt count who may feel a little bitter about not being heard when they played by the rules and though i sympathize with their concerns i would call on them to put whatever resentment they have aside and join us in the fight to make sure that florida goes for the democrats in november
4035821 hold off the state of florida which i won is yet to be resolved
4035822 nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody somewhere was willing to hope
4035823 how long will you keep us in suspense if you are the christ tell us plainly
4035824 i told you and you do not believe the works that i do in my fathers name these testify of me
4035825 but you do not believe because you are not of my sheep
4035826 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me
4035827 we have 8 tickets available yes 8 thats it and we have to close the doors to new registrations this is absolutely your last chance to get a ticket to our event look at the list of top speakers you will miss if you dont buy a ticket today
4035828 it was wet and he tried to stop and slipped
4035829 the doctors are looking at the x rays it could have been a costly win
4035830 weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
4035831 fourth place is probably the worst spot you can get in the olympic games especially by a tenth of a second its extremely disappointing but having said that its the second fastest ive ever been in my life
4035832 obviously i would have loved the medal the first medal for canada would have been awesome to have
4035833 obviously theres added pressure to trying to be the first but this is the olympics
4035834 this is the biggest pressure cooker you are going to find in competition and i thrive on that stuff
4035835 you know what if people have problems of a partisan nature they should not use the death of a firefighter or anything associated with a disaster to deal with it so shut up
4035836 ive been representing this community for 25 years i know when a person is using me and using the situation for partisan purposes
4035837 the majority of my constituents plan on attending my meeting which is the official city meeting
4035838 she has the nerve to come here and tell us to shut up who is she representing
4035839 i dont care where shes having her meeting she should come to us we dont go to her
4035840 here we are trying to go home and she yells like that
4035841 at a time like this people need to come together
4035842 when my goggles did fill up there was nothing i could do i could just swim
4035843 im disappointed i knew i could go faster than that
4035844 one of the biggest honours is wearing the stars and stripes every time im out there and now being the greatest olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it
4035845 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
4035846 he makes it look easy but he really works hard at it
4035847 christmas happens every year you can only get to be an olympic gold medalist so many times it never never gets old
4035848 you barely mentioned my son finishing in the top eight
4035849 its not over yet anything can happen in the next three events
4035850 i kept thinking greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
4035851 es gibt knapp zehn verschiedene lasertypen und jeder kann etwas anderes
4035852 mein ziel war es einen laser zu entwickeln mit dem ein zahnarzt mit einem einzigen ger t alle behandlungen ausf hren kann
4035853 wir hatten damals eine klare vision wir wollten den besten zahnmedizinischen laser der welt bauen
4035854 in deutschland nutzen heute rund acht prozent der zahn rzte solche ger te in ganz europa f nf prozent
4035855 medizinische gr nde gegen den laser gibt es praktisch nicht und auch bei den patienten ist die akzeptanz sehr hoch
4035856 der hauptgrund warum sich die zahn rzte keinen laser leisten ist der preis 75 prozent der rzte sagten sie sind schlichtweg zu teuer
4035857 dort ist die akzeptanz des lasers bei zahn rzten durch kleinere und preiswertere ger te binnen kurzer zeit von zehn auf 15 prozent gestiegen
4035858 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4035859 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4035860 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4035861 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4035862 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4035863 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4035864 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4035865 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4035866 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4035867 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4035868 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4035869 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4035870 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4035871 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4035872 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4035873 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4035874 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4035875 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4035876 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4035877 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4035878 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4035879 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4035880 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4035881 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4035882 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4035883 nothing is so contagious as opinion especially on questions which being susceptible of very different glosses beget in the mind a distrust of itself
4035884 as it is to say the same thing about the sovereignty free will issue
4035885 are not referring to the same thing there is no resultant contradiction
4035886 then by definition it contradicts the definition of gods sovereignty found in the wcf chapter iii section i
4035887 gods sovereignty mans free will and the nature of contradiction
4035888 god hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty that it is neither forced nor by any absolute necessity of nature determined to good or evil

4035894 yes while saif has my name on his forearm stallone has his wife jennifer flavins face tattooed on his arm and the holly actor told saif to do the same with my photo on his arm
4035895 saif is against tattoos on women even i think women shouldnt they should be pure and clean

4035901 they know its putting a strain on our health facilities whether its doctors offices or hospitals and so on and those are all in short supply
4035902 they worry theres an awful lot of health care costs being spent here that could be spent more productively
4035903 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4035904 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4035905 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4035907 if the puppies got any parvo ill tell you one thing it didnt come from here
4035908 you guys shouldnt be harassing me you should go after the puppy mills because i just buy and sell
4035909 i feel too foolish i didnt even read any of the stories about the puppy deaths
4035910 the puppy was in a straw basket with big sunflowers and it was hard to resist
4035911 i had agreed to meet her at the ferry wharf in pictou county and i was going to pay 900 for the puppy
4035912 pulled the puppy out of her purse and put her on my knees and it just looked sick
4035913 i called the office for the veterinarian and the person who answered the phone was very leery and asked me if the papers were photocopied
4035914 i told her they were and she asked me dont you read the papers and then told me red light
4035915 i had my little nine year old sister with me and she was beginning to cry because this woman was so insistent and because my little sister wanted the puppy
4035916 finally this guy flew out of the van and started screaming at me
4035917 they then got in the van and stormed off and i called the spca and reported what happened but it wasnt until i got home and googled her name that i found out about the dead puppies
4035918 look this is big business and there is a lot of money to be made if people keep buying this way

4035922 any right thinking adult knows that touching the breast and vaginal area of a young girl is a criminal offence

4035924 express shock and disbelief that he had found himself in this predicament
4035925 acknowledges that he knew it was wrong but at the time he says he just couldnt help himself
4035926 to be thinking in those sorts of terms is just incomprehensible

4035928 one more important tip if you havent read it already do not sign up for a three year contract once you are locked in you are locked in you have to pay your contract out in full to terminate
4035929 i was sold from anikast to xplornet so i did not get it installed by xplornet
4035930 normaly i wont install a dish on the roof but when i have had too i do use silicone or latex calking and i have had modems that have taken
4035931 i dont know the technical difference but i recall being told by tech support that if i wanted to do voip i should switch to
4035932 your biggest issue you will run into with any satellite service is network latency telesat wont even look at anything as a latency issue unless there is more then a 5 second delay that a 5k ping for a gamer average on satellite is going to run somewhere around see if there is a wireless provider in your area latency should be from around 1024 256 xplornet package gears of war amp halo3 do not work very well too much latencey you shoot and seconds later you see the shoot call of duty 3 is not as bad overall satellite broadband is not the way to go for on line gaming
4035933 online gaming will not happen very well if at all with satellite internet different types of satellite internet have differing latencies average latency on downstream a would be
4035934 i visited my mother a month ago and they have this service it is total dogshit for gaming average ping to google com for instance is 1700ms compare that to normal cable internet service which runs at the data will take way too long to reach the server and return to your computer to make it playable you will basically be fodder for players and npcs alike and end up booting your computer across the room in a fit of rage i shit you not dial up would probably work better for you
4035935 i have xplornet have never been satisfied with the service im just waiting for my contract to expire and im back to dial up
4035936 we play wow and everquest and you can expect ping rates of 1800 to 2000 as the usual you can forget seeing anything in the 3 digit range a very good day is 1300
4035937 one more important tip if you havent read it already do not sign up for a three year contract once you are locked in you are locked in you have to pay your contract out in full to terminate
4035938 i was sold from anikast to xplornet so i did not get it installed by xplornet i had no other choice i was with directpc bell they shut down and i had to buy a new dish and modem and go with anikast telasat bell i ordered the 500 down and 100 up package the package was 54 00 a month i have yet to sign a contract with xplornet i just was transfered over a month ago its just a new name on my credit card the modem i have with this system is a surf beam this is a ka band system when i called to get some new email addresses things seemed to go good i needed the in out codes so i could get them working in outlook the problem with xplornet is the fap fair access policy if you use more the the average usage in an hour the next hour they cut your bandwidth by 25 percent for an hour so you buy bandwith from xplornet and you use it they cut your bandwith down this sorta defeats the purpose of getting bandwidth i ask the tech guy how much bandwidth can i use before it will be cut back he tells me its an average and it changes all the time so i cant give you a number so you never know when you are useing to much and will get cut back the record of how many times you have had your bandwidth cut back only goes back a week i was cut back 7 times over the last week another thing is if you call over slow bandwidth they tell you to do 4 tests on their test site over 24 hours this is the same site anikast used if you dont do the tests over 24 hours they will not let you go up to a level 2 tech guy so if you have any bandwith problem it will take a least a day the bottom line is i have had this system for 18 months the seem to do their work on the system from 2 am until 6 am eastern every now and then it will be out but not very often i would say its 98 percent up time over 18 months let me on your luck with xplornet i cancelled my xplornet service feb 2008 i had no contract and it was still a pain trying to cancel i sent them an email letting them no i was canceling 3 days later it was still working i call them up a the girl goes anyone could be calling to cancel the service and would not cancel my service until i filled out a form from their web site i told her i do not have a printer so i cant fill out the form she told me to go to my public library and get a print out there the closest library to me is 40 k away or 24 miles i told her thats not happening so the next day i sent in a hand written fax notice of cancelation with no form att so a few days later some other girl calls and says she will let me cancel but before she trys to get me back by boosting me up to the next package of 1000k down for a few days to check it out i told her i was at 1000k down until you bought me from anikast and you cut me back to 500 down when you go to the 1000k service you get what you paid for with the 500k package and annikast knew it and boosted me up for free so i would get what i was suppost to get i have had internet service in the bahamas europe the toronto area a few and out in british columbia i have delt with at least 10 cos over this planet xplornet is buy far the worst co i have ever had to deal with for a internet connection they sell you a service for 500 k down and you are lucky to get 200 to 300 k down unless its 3 am quit a bit of the time you get less than 200k down you call tech and they give you the run around like they dont know they have oversold the service and your beam is full then i head down to my mail box and i have another flyer for the service the service is so oversold they put up another sat for southern eastern ont they are putting up wireless towers to make more space on the beams i would stay clear of this co at all costs one more sleazy thing they do is when they sign you up you have 30 days to cancel they dont fap you until the 30 days has gone buy so when you service does not work as it should you are locked into a contract for 2 or 3 years i looked at the contract and it is 8 pages long first of all you need a lawyer to understand it but the bottom line is everything goes against you you cant cancel for poor service if you have to move you are out of luck if your house burns down they want you to keep paying for the service its an outrage these thieves are still to be in the biz
4035939 to whom it may concern i went with xplornet in november of last year and up until april i didnt have too many problems however as of about two weeks ago we have been down
4035940 so i got an email from storm a great wireless isp in ottawa area a few months ago saying that theyd been bought out by xplornet
4035941 xplornet uses some of the best worst traffic shaping to stop p2p incoming packets etc from their network this means that they have firewalls on the ground terminals that analyze the network packets and figure out if they are part of connections that they want to limit p2p incoming http requests etc and they send a rst command to whatever is requesting them which indicates to the nic network card that the connection is closed this causes the card to drop the connection rather than xplornet so technically your computer is quitting rather than them cutting you off sneaky eh
4035942 normaly i wont install a dish on the roof but when i have had too i do use silicone or latex calking and i have had modems that have taken 24 hours to lock but they are few and far between
4035943 i dont know the technical difference but i recall being told by tech support that if i wanted to do voip i should switch to
4035944 your biggest issue you will run into with any satellite service is network latency telesat wont even look at anything as a latency issue unless there is more then a 5 second delay that a 5k ping for a gamer average on satellite is going to run somewhere around 800 2000ms see if there is a wireless provider in your area latency should be from around 80 400ms
4035945 my kids use xbox live on our 1024 256 xplornet package gears of war amp halo3 do not work very well too much latencey you shoot and seconds later you see the shoot call of duty 3 is not as bad overall satellite broadband is not the way to go for on line gaming
4035946 online gaming will not happen very well if at all with satellite internet different types of satellite internet have differing latencies average latency on downstream a would be 600 1200 ms and on the b downstream it varies but ca be as high 2500ms you would not make very many freinds and probably would die a lot wow will work on dialup better than satellite the system has its uses gaming is not one of them however
4035947 i have xplornet have never been satisfied with the service
4035948 11 early cancellation for wireless and satellite ka band customers only at anytime prior to the 30th day following the activation date of the service you may cancel this agreement without further obligation on your part and receive a refund of you initial fees as well as the cost of the standard installation in the event of such notification and where you are in possession of rental equipment we shall arrange to have an installer attend at your premises and remove all rental equipment and return it to us no refund shall be paid for damaged rental equipment nor for any peripheral items such as reflector dishes cables tripods brackets poles etc in all other cases for all xplornet customers you agree that if you terminate your subscription to the services prior to the expiration of the initial term we have the right in addition to all other amounts due to us pursuant to these terms of service as liquidated damages and not as penalty to receive from you the lesser of the two amounts 25 multiplied by the number of full months remaining in the non cancelable initial term as specified on your signed service agreement or change of service form or a one time charge of 450
4035949 tonight liverpool were a little bit asleep but now they will wake up
4035950 it is always important not to concede away from home and with the second leg at anfield there will have to be a massive difference i didnt need to say much to the players afterwards because they know it was a bad performance
4035951 i am surprised with how we played because the team had been playing in pre season with a lot of confidence
4035952 i dont like the fact that he refereed liverpools game with valerenga
4035953 the team didnt play well so the strikers couldnt play well reina was our man of the match
4035954 we were very lucky to have got away with a draw very lucky not to have conceded goals
4035955 it was a very disappointing performance but the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4035956 i saw them finishing construction on this aboiteau just last summer it just goes to show you the power of the tides
4035957 it may look like the river is doing the damage but that isnt the case
4035958 this is a case of the tides coming in two weeks ago and simply destroying an aboiteau the agriculture department put in just last year its also a case that every time the tide comes in more pressure is put on the dike because the force of the tide is eroding its base
4035959 thank goodness the old aboiteau that this one was supposed to replace held if it hadnt hundreds of acres of valuable farmland and much of the sod farm behind us here would have been under salt water when the tides came in if that had happened a lot of good farmland would have been made useless
4035960 and that is going to be important because with global warming the tides are going to involve more water which means the tides will be higher and there will be more pressure on these dikes
4035961 in fact there could be enough water to cover the train tracks the trans canada highway if they arent maintained and strengthened nova scotia could become an island
4035962 they may know about it but i believe this disaster here really shows the province no longer has the expertise to maintain the dike system
4035963 the federal government pulled out years ago and left it to the province i checked with the federal agriculture department and they tell me they no longer have anyone on staff with the expertise to maintain the dikes and i think the failure of this aboiteau shows the province has lost its expertise as well
4035964 we need to get that expertise back at both the federal and provincial level because if we dont this province will become an island and thousands of acres of much needed farmland will be lost to the salt water
4035965 we need to get it back too because i suspect it will cost millions to upgrade these dikes
4035966 this truly is the most important issue that has come across my table in a while the federal government has to be involved because new brunswick will be facing the same problem
4035967 i believe they need to join forces initially to do a study to find out exactly what the state of these dikes are and what needs to be done to upgrade them to meet the challenges that will be caused by global warming
4035968 they must then work together to ensure these dikes will continue to do the job they were intended to do
4035969 transferring sultan kohails case to an adult court is very troubling given the possibility of him receiving the death penalty
4035970 we are working very hard with our lawyer but i dont know what will happen
4035971 usually after a sentence is done its done period but the implication in sultans case is that there is some pressure applied and it seems to come from the murdered mans family
4035972 this is what they are aiming for otherwise why change things

4035991 the farm bureau supports the continuing existence of pvwma and the fee as a stopgap measure
4035992 the entire conversation and the entire desire were initiated by mr barany
4035993 it was very transparent that it was a 13 year old girl and it was very transparent that he was engaging in this conversation to at some point engage in a lewd act with her
4035994 as a teacher he really is a trusted member of the community and he couldnt have done anything worse to break that trust
4035995 we heard about the arrest yesterday and he was put on a paid administrative leave
4035996 theyre constantly monitoring web sites dealing with financial fraud identity theft and sites that may engage in exploitation of children

4036010 test scores are important they can be a source of community pride but engagement is key
4036011 i dont think its fair to say that we suspect it but were certainly going to look at that
4036012 he got out of his car to see what was up with the other driver
4036013 i would like there to be a little more transparency
4036014 if you talk to teachers in the district they feel very unappreciated
4036015 the only way were going to get through all this and get back to focusing on educating our kids is to talk collegially
4036016 i want to make sure all parties are represented and can have functional communication between them

4036024 the new model is very refined its a completely different car
4036025 for the more old school enthusiasts though i think they may prefer the more raw power of the older models
4036026 the roads are just garbage we all are sporting fresh chips in our windshields
4036027 i remember having lamborghini posters hanging in my room when i was a kid
4036028 weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and
4036029 whether targets the answer i dont know im hoping we can find a solution and find a way to bring in revenue
4036030 im not a happy camper with how things have been going
4036031 what needs to happen is the city needs to have a smart growth policy
4036032 im not going to take a position on target in this race
4036033 id like to find an answer for the greatest good of everyone involved
4036034 the city has a lot of development and economic issues pressing them

4036040 the county needs to go back and look at other properties for other sites for future growth
4036041 wed probably have a better plan and a better project if we did it together
4036042 people need to remember all the county needs to do is rezone the property

4036114 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
4036115 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally

4036127 what happened happened and we are not going to review that situation
4036128 kerry have been communicated with officially and they have accepted that
4036129 we were led to believe it was up to the kerry county board to interpret the rule as we saw fit

4036155 at grade a the gap between wales and england is slightly larger in favour of england unfortunately so maybe theres a slight concern there that with the very highest level of ability the welsh statistic is falling slightly bellow england
4036156 congratulations must go out to students across wales today as they celebrate their excellent examination achievements i was particularly pleased to see the increased participation rates and great results that have been achieved for example in maths and ict
4036157 the company recorded record revenues during the second quarter reflecting a growth of 23 compared to the parallel quarter last
4036158 during the second quarter el al faced the challenge of the international crisis in aviation
4036159 el al continued to meet the challenge of the ever increasing competition competition characterized by the increase in seating capacity offered by foreign carriers el als market share during the quarter was about 34 flight hours of scheduled and charter flights increased by about 17 in addition el al succeeded in maintaining high load factors of about 81
4036160 we are obligated to and ready for the continuing efforts required to face the world crisis in aviation the challenging market conditions and the ever growing competition we believe that el als continued financially stable foundation and solidity together with our steps and efforts at efficiency and the ongoing process of improving the quality and service excellence of our product are the keys to continuing to maintain el al as the leader in the aviation sector
4036161 in this quarter as well we continued to face the challenges of many influential external factors these factors resulted in a substantial increase of 37 in operating expenses the increase stems mainly from the high price of aviation fuel which led to expenditures of 214 million an 80 increase even after returns from hedging of 22 million the effect of the exchange rates caused an expenditure increase of 20 million after the returns of exchange rate hedging of 5 5 million the company continues with its investment and efficiency programs thanks to the strong cash flow which at the end of the quarter totaled 279 million this is after an investment of 66 million in fixed assets and after debt repayment of 22 million during the first half of 2008

4036167 creating a sort of double jeopardy for companies first having to run the fda approval maze then allowing a nationwide quilt of different laws and standards to second guess that approval
4036168 far from representing a radical departure in the law the courts reasoning upheld what had become a common opinion in the federal court system
4036169 reigel only applied to products in the strictest fda tranche known as premarket approval products which represent 1 to 2 of the overall medical device market
4036170 those who believe theyve been injured by medical devices can still sue for a poorly manufactured product or they can attempt to show that the fda didnt get all the necessary information when the device was approved
4036171 what mr waxman really wants to restore is the trial lawyer bingo that can net jackpot jury awards while wreaking havoc on national standards
4036172 democrats want tort lawyers and juries of lawmen to be the ultimate arbiters of new devices then they should do away with the fda entirely and go to an underwriters laboratory system that gets devices to patients more rapidly
4036173 they want it both ways agonizingly slow device approvals and open tort season after the fact
4036174 if congress really wants to improve the quality of medical products for consumers it would better spend its energy on reforming the bureaucratic morass that is the fda
4036175 this audit was only a small snapshot across the region and indicates a bigger problem we havent seen any decrease in the level of non compliance and that is a major concern
4036176 dairying in the region has intensified over the past decade and we are starting to see its impact on water quality in our streams rivers lakes and wetlands no one denies its importance to our economy but we want to ensure that dairying is both economically successful and environmentally responsible
4036177 greater wellington is committed to the goals of the clean streams accord to achieve clean healthy water in dairying areas
4036178 a significant part of our commitment is to check progress against the third target of the accord that is ensuring all farm dairy effluent discharges comply with resource consents and regional plans
4036179 some farmers are doing good work to reduce dairyings impact on the environment fencing rivers and streams planting stream sides to retain nutrients and provide for biodiversity providing winter pads for cows with effluent collection and nutrient budgeting
4036180 i congratulate these farmers on their commitment to the environment however the level of non compliance shows that others are still not getting the message that dairy waste must be properly managed
4036181 i am energetic i feel wonderful or i feel safe
4036182 i am a prosperous person i lose weight easily or i solve problems easily we use affirmations to help to us lose weight and stop smoking to build our self confidence and self esteem to help us get out of depression or to relieve our anger anxiety and for stress management
4036183 your competitor can do it for 5 less than you can this is especially true during tough economic times when companies are trying to squeeze every dollar they can
4036184 those two games in particular show there is very very little between all three teams in the tri nations
4036185 if you are not 100 per cent and get things dead right you will come second you just have to make sure you get your preparation right to play as well as you can
4036186 the win two weeks ago was satisfying but its easy to do one its about being able to back that performance up and thats what were trying to do
4036187 how a backrower operates comes off what happens in front of you
4036188 the last match was a great indicator of that the front five got stuck in and made our jobs a lot easier
4036189 he adds a lot of energy there and in the physical side of things he is always in amongst it
4036190 how effective you are depends on whether you get front foot ball or not i know certainly when you dont have front foot ball he can be a real menace
4036191 but for this all black team we want to make sure every time we go into a tri nations or any test we perform as well as we can and hopefully get the results were after
4036192 we have two games left and if we can win those two games we give ourselves a chance
4036193 we will not let russia threaten its neighbour and let it get away with it
4036194 children are losing their benefits under this punitive policy change
4036195 clearly the children who are most negatively impacted are children who have the most serious health care needs
4036196 improving health and promoting healthy behaviors are laudable goals but restricting health care coverage for infants and children is not the way to achieve them
4036197 monitoring our enrollment data to gauge the long term success of implementation
4036198 an oversimplification of whats happening with the medicaid program and we truly wish they would have called to ask us about it
4036199 contributing to the shortage is that too few medical students choose primary care
4036200 this is the unfortunate reality of our health care system its an example of how the market triumphs over public policy
4036201 even if universal health care comes into play tomorrow not everyone would have access to a health care provider
4036202 add homelessness mental illness or drug addiction into the mix and taking much needed medication falls from the top of the priority list
4036203 we dont know to what extent ongoing drug use interferes or affects the medication they take but crack or heroin interferes with adherence
4036204 theyre more than just an hiv infected person or a person using crack every day or a homeless person these are problems no one can manage by themselves these folks have struggled their whole lives
4036205 on paper they look good but hiv dementia and other problems have set in and even though newer medication has people living longer lives most of our residents probably wont ever go and live on their own
4036206 the person standing in front of you is a new customer the next 5 minutes are critical to giving them a reason to come back here for service again and again and maybe buy their next car here right now their relationship with us is entirely in your hands make a difference to this customer in the next 5 minutes

4036253 for the most part these social networking sites should be viewed as complementary to your online presence think of it as a nice to have not a must have
4036254 when used properly it is something that can gain your business some attention however you need to realize it shouldnt be seen as a replacement to your traditional online presence
4036255 sites such as linkedin can be helpful in connecting with people you want to meet for one reason or another twitter and facebook can be helpful when youre trying to notify a group of people about something you want to promote or about a happening of some kind
4036256 the viral nature of social networking is quite extraordinary and something that can garner a lot of attention to your efforts in a hurry
4036257 the site requires some r sum creation then offers the opportunity to link in to other like minded professionals when used selectively it can be a very powerful tool for identifying new business partners new employees or simply building your personal or business presence
4036258 consider establishing or joining a network on facebook based on your business or industry category to tap into peoples affinity for the topic by doing this youll cut through the clutter and clearly establish your niche keeping the interaction focused on the specific subject matter
4036259 it puts a human face on your business and allows people to get an impression of what a relationship with you would be like when all things remain equal people want to work with people they think theyll have an interesting relationship with
4036260 if i put up a youtube video to create awareness i might have some discussion on youtube with the responders and then also put it on my blog on my facebook company page and promote a link to it on just by generating that single asset ive populated all those networks with content without having to come up with an original piece of content for each of them theres a geometric extension of your reach
4036261 rather than blogging stream of consciousness opinions or using the venue as a diary of sorts i educate visitors on important universal industry matters i try my utmost to ensure the content i post is not just applicable and of interest to those in las vegas where i operate but also to any real estate consumer nationwide

4036277 as a powerful icon dutch windmills rich in variation continue to help define and articulate the dutch landscape
4036278 at the same time they symbolize the resourcefulness and inventiveness of the people in the netherlands
4036279 which is what people would rightly expect we shot windmills in any season and in all kinds of weather both in the gorgeous light for which holland is famous and in the stormy weather which is also a fact of life in the netherlands
4036280 it was vital therefore to show them in full operation
4036281 and not just as idle monuments in the landscapes we have portrayed dozens of windmills from within to see what they are about how they work what they do their mechanical structure is always impressive these machines have got soul as a miller from the zaanse schans said you must try to find the very heart of the windmill and that is precisely the point of our story

4036389 failed to adequately teach critical thinking and modern historical analytic methods
4036390 instructs that the bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events attributes historical events to divine providence rather than analyzing human action evaluates historical figures and their contributions based on their religious motivations or lack thereof and contains inadequate treatment of several major ethnic groups women and non christian religious groups

4036392 the next day i thought about what samantha said she wasnt having sex because she wanted to have a relationship and i was having mind blowing sex hoping to turn it into a relationship so there you have it weve got a relationship without sex and sex without a relationship which had a better shot at survival i couldnt help but wonder what comes first the chicken or the sex

4036406 questo perch ha spiegato lesponente della lega capogruppo al senato i voti possono variare da universit a universit a seconda delle aree geografiche essendo riconosciuta una pi o meno severa valutazione tra atenei del nord e del sud anche in base a parametri internazionali
4036407 indubbiamente a differenza delle vecchie modalit ha sottolineato pittoni il nuovo regolamento per il reclutamento dei dirigenti scolastici varato dal ministro gelmini privileger pi il merito rispetto allanzianit di servizio e gi questo dovrebbe fare una bella differenza

4036424 the government has to take the issue seriously now it is becoming a litmus test of browns ability to show leadership in the country and reconnect with a demoralised party
4036425 revenues from the tax should be ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
4036426 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards therefore much of the money raised should be used to kick start a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor

4036429 el contingente de paz ruso seguir siendo el principal garante de la seguridad y la vida tranquila de la poblaci n de abjasia y osetia del sur en todas las variantes de desarrollo de la situaci n all todo lo dem s puede debatirse pero siempre tomando en consideraci n los intereses de los abjasios y los osetas e invariablemente con la participaci n de ellos
4036430 para saakashvili tras aquello que l emprendi con respecto a osetia del sur se ha cerrado la
4036431 no importan los ep tetos injuriosos que ponga saakashvili a nuestro contingente de paz ste sigue siendo la nica fuerza en que depositan confianza los pueblos de abjasia y osetia del sur viendo en l una garant a de su seguridad
4036432 seg n los datos que obran en nuestro poder el bombardero tu 22 y varios aviones de asalto su 25 fueron derribados con misiles s 200 y tor suministrados a georgia por ucrania
4036433 los militares ucranianos fueron los que manejaron esos sistemas antia reos
4036434 el canal cnn est transmitiendo filmaciones enga osas del conflicto entre georgia y rusia torciendo la opini n p blica a favor de lo georgianos
4036435 mientras los habitantes de osetia reclamaron m s de 1000 muertos ni la bbc report esto ni cualquier otro noticiero saliendo de osetia mostrando la destrucci n causada por el bombardeo georgiano de la rep blica separada todo lo que estamos obteniendo son informes desiguales de la destrucci n causada por los rusos
4036436 si el antiguo presidente yugoslavo slobodan milosevic tuvo que ser juzgado la opini n en este pa s es que lo mismo deber a pasar con saakashvili
4036437 una vez que terminen los bombardeos creo que saakashvili no sobrevivir
4036438 de otra manera los rusos estar n convirtiendo a saakashvili en la v ctima
4036439 uribe siempre ha dicho muchas mentiras que se han quedado all como mentiras empezando con todo esto del afortunado regreso de los secuestrados

4036441 que bien que civilizado es viene de los pueblos originarios pero entiende la modernizaci n del estado
4036442 de hecho georgia ya hace tiempo que hab a dejado de participar en la comunidad y con esta ltima agresi n militar infringi todas las normas internacionales y las normas de la cei
4036443 es dif cil comentar las acciones de un enfermo mental que adem s de ser presidente de un pa s es un bandido a escala internacional y debe responder por la muerte de miles de personas
4036444 hasta hoy d a nadie comet a tama a estupidez creo que todas las partes involucradas en ese conflicto b lico son sus v ctimas rusia georgia y osetia del sur
4036445 por supuesto la poblaci n de osetia del sur qued en un estado catastr fico pero lo propio puede decirse tambi n de los habitantes del poblado georgiano de gori al que hab an dejado sin ninguna protecci n
4036446 no quiero dar valoraciones al comportamiento del gobierno de georgia qu dios juzgue y castigue a los culpables
4036447 ucrania es el principal proveedor de armamento y material a georgia
4036448 a lo largo de la jornada de hoy se han registrado disparos espor dicos de francotiradores
4036449 responder a tales provocaciones tal y como anunci de forma inequ voca el comandante en jefe
4036450 esta condici n no se cumple del todo a d a de hoy
4036451 gracias a un pron stico acertado y a la decisi n del contingente ruso fue posible abortar semejantes planes desarmar a las formaciones georgianas y enfriar mentes calenturientas en la c pula de georgia
4036452 act an en el marco del plan trazado para la entrega de armas
4036453 por lo visto l no puede calmarse porque los principios consensuados con el presidente de francia no recogen nada parecido al contrario confirman el papel de rusia como pacificador
4036454 el ej rcito de abjasia se coloc en la frontera con georgia en el desfiladero de kodori
4036455 pese a los acuerdos de arreglo pac fico de la situaci n en la zona del conflicto georgiano oseta y en violaci n de la carta de la onu las fuerzas armadas de georgia con autorizaci n de su direcci n pol tica invadieron el 8 de agosto de 2008 el territorio de osetia del sur y con empleo de aviaci n armamento pesado y armas de fuego intentaron ocuparla exterminando la poblaci n pac fica
4036456 de este modo se perpetr el genocidio del pueblo suroseta quedaron pr cticamente destruidas la ciudad de tsjinvali y otras localidades lo que provoc la cat strofe humanitaria en osetia del sur adem s fue lanzado el ataque armado contra el contingente militar de las fuerzas armadas de rusia en virtud de los acuerdos internacionales cumple misi n de normalizar la situaci n en la zona del conflicto georgiano oseta lo que la resoluci n de la asamblea general de la onu de 14 de diciembre de 1974 tipifica como acto de agresi n
4036457 a consecuencia se registraron numerosas v ctimas entre la poblaci n de osetia del sur y las bajas entre el efectivo del contingente militar de las fuerzas armadas de rusia
4036458 saakashvili parece preocuparse menos por el futuro de esta gente los osetas que por afirmar que ellos viven en el territorio de georgia
4036459 todas las casas cuna escuelas y el nico hospital existente fueron destruidos en el primer d a
4036460 el ej rcito ruso dispone de armas de alta precisi n que se utilizan contra blancos detectados y permiten renunciar a los bombardeos alfombra tales armas se emplearon
4036461 lo ocurrido en osetia del sur es en gran medida responsabilidad suya
4036462 no pudieron frenar a mija l saakashvili ante la tentaci n de resolver la totalidad de sus problemas mediante una guerra
4036463 los cr menes perpetrados por el r gimen de tbilisi en osetia del sur mecere que sean investigados por los tribunales internacionales
4036464 la operaci n alcanz su objetivo se logr restablecer la seguridad de la fuerza de paz y de la poblaci n el agresor se llev el castigo y sufri p rdidas sustanciales
4036465 su ej rcito el de agresor est desorganizado no obstante de surgir focos de resistencia u otros ambiciones agresivas procedan a aplastarlos
4036466 no creo que rusia tenga nimos para sostener conversaciones con el se or saakashvili y mucho menos para hablar con l
4036467 las tropas de paz georgianas no pueden encontrase all osetia del norte porque cometieron un delito al disparar contra sus colegas con los que cumpl an su misi n de servicio
4036468 esperamos que la brigada georgiana que regres al pa s desde iraq en aviones de transporte estadounidenses no aparezca en la regi n de acciones de combate ello causar a un notable deterioro a las relaciones entre eeuu y rusia
4036469 nos dej consternados la reacci n de eeuu a la agresi n georgiana
4036470 administraci n de bush guard el silencio cuando los georgianos borraron de la faz de la tierra a tsjinvali mataron a m s de 2 000 civiles y unos 30 000 personas tuvieron que buscar refugio en rusia pero al mismo tiempo lanz un ataque verbal contra mosc apenas rusia envi refuerzos a su fuerza de paz para salvar a los civiles del asesinato cruel a sangre fr a

4036480 no its uncomfortable when im at home i wear normal clothes
4036481 no i prefer the company of men i havent slept with anyone since i was 16
4036482 im pleased that it the task has worked out but not pleased that it has upset you
4036483 you just need to be yourself and you put on a smile life is hard
4036484 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65
4036485 still significantly underestimates the number of deaths because we dont actually take any other areas where air pollution does cause cancer in other areas of the body
4036486 the numbers to me were not a surprise they were consistent with others numbers id heard
4036487 this is a call to urgent action on the reduction of air pollutants and we need a strategy across the country that reduces the emissions that are causing this critical literally speaking critical health problem
4036488 weve worked well with health and environmental groups and the provinces weve had a good dialogue over the last 18 months and were looking forward to more aggressive action
4036489 that is a huge hit and huge burden upon our health care system
4036490 the single most important thing is modified mandatory and enforceable reliability standards in the united states and we are working towards that in all of the provinces of canada
4036491 in ontario theres very little that has changed since the blackout because frankly we were already there
4036492 if we continue with our current centralized energy system were vulnerable to power mishaps
4036493 but its also understandable if you witnessed the behaviour she augimeri was confronted with carroll said adding that di santo didnt want information he just wanted to
4036494 hes been abusive with me for many years verbally she said adding
4036495 she told us to shut up how unprofessional is that
4036496 but it doesnt compare to what these people went through
4036497 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4036498 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4036499 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the
4036500 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
4036501 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
4036502 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
4036503 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
4036504 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
4036505 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
4036506 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4036507 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4036508 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4036509 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4036510 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4036511 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4036512 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4036516 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4036517 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4036518 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4036519 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4036520 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4036521 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4036522 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4036544 are you trying to scare your readers or do you have facts that state why gas will go to 4 dollars a gallon

4036754 where was i oh yes i floated into this place decades ago but when i tried to float out again i found that i couldnt i was incredibly bored in here as you can imagine but one day i had a vision i was a man still but my clothes were different i was wearing robes and my hair was longer i also had this overwhelming sensation to protect something no wait somebody it was very curious but entertaining also as more years passed by i began to have different visions walking through a forest studying for exams falling in love with women i dont really remember being on trial sitting through other peoples trials and worst of all killing people that seems to happen to me a lot the dreams of killing people
4036755 whispers hell most of the time its like a bloody rock concert in here everyone talking at once as if it were their last words
4036756 what if you were hearing people trapped in another place maybe another time do you think that might be why they are yelling so loud
4036757 its that funny place in between heaven and hell right
4036758 yes exactly perhaps thats what this arch is a gateway purgatory would serve as a punishment for those who had done bad but wouldnt kill them per say
4036759 what if you being a ghost someone closer to the supernatural are easier to contact than someone say like me flesh and blood
4036760 so because im already dead im easier to talk to
4036761 if your right do you think we could talk back
4036762 i think we already are they can always hear us having once been apart of this world but we cant hear them having never been a part of that world
4036763 but they could all be dead you said thats what people already believe right
4036764 did you know that the nargle is the most highly evolved species unknown to man
4036765 what happened did that man mean the harry harry potter
4036766 but his tense was present as if he is around still alive
4036767 and he offered to assist by recovering the surveillance videos and the debit cards
4036768 we continue to stress our defense and really work hard at that end of the floor
4036769 oh well records are meant to be broken it feels good but we just wanted to get the win we wanted to come out and perform well
4036770 they are getting better each game and what you can expect from spain is they are athletic they play with a lot of passion and energy and feed off it
4036771 weve played them quite a bit through the years and we know well have to play well to move on to the next game
4036772 i said to my assistant coach maybe the lights will go out now and it could be over
4036773 allah swt telah menciptakan wajah wajah bidadari terdiri dari 4 warna putih hijau kuning dan merah dan tubuhnya diciptakan dari zafaran misik dan kafur dan rambutnya diciptakan dari cengkeh bahagian tubuhnya mulai dari kaki sampai lutut tercipta dari zafaran dari lutut sampai buah dada tercipta dari anbar dari leher sampai kepala tercipta dari kafur andaikata meludah ke dunia maka ludahnya akan menjelma menjadi misik pada setiap dadanya tertulis nama suaminya dan nama dari nama nama allah swt pada setiap tangannya mengenakan 10 gelang dari emas memakai cincin sebanyak 10 pada jari jarinya memakai 10 perhiasan gelang kaki dari mutiara dan permata
4036774 di sediakan tempat untuk berkumpulnya para bidadari dan di sana mereka beryanyi semerdu suara yang belum pernah didengar oleh manusia suara semerdu itu kamilah yang kekal dan tak akan rosak berubah kamilah selalu senang tak pernah susah kamilah yang puas rela tak akan marah sungguh bahagia orang yang untuk kami dan kami untuknya
4036775 aku mendengar dia mengatakan sesuatu di antara dengkur nafasnya yang tersengal sengal menjelang ajal
4036776 aku tak tahu ya rasulullah apakah ucapannya itu sekadar rintihan sebelum mati atau pekikan pedih kerana dahsyatnya sakaratul maut cuma ucapannya memang payah difahami lantaran merupakan kalimat yang terpotong potong
4036777 dia mengatakan andai kata lebih panjang lagi andai kata masih baru andai kata semuanya hanya itulah yang tertangkap sehingga kami bingung dibuatnya
4036778 adapun ucapan yang kedua dikatakannya ketika dia melihat hasil perbuatannya yang lain
4036779 cuba andaikan yang kuberikan padanya bukan mantelku yang lama pasti pahalaku jauh lebih besar lagi
4036780 ingatkah kamu pada suatu ketika suamimu datang dalam keadaan sangat lapar dan meminta disediakan makanan
4036781 kalau aku tahu begini hasilnya musafir itu tidak aku berikan separuh sebab andai kata semuanya kuberikan kepadanya sudah pasti ganjaranku akan berlipat ganda
4036782 dan laksanakanlah solat dan tunaikanlah zakat dan segala kebaikan yang kamu kerjakan untuk dirimu kamu akan mendapatkannya pahala di sisi allah sungguh allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan
4036783 hakikatnya memang itulah keadilan alllah kalau kita berbuat baik sebetulnya kita berbuat baik kepada diri kita sendiri dan kalau kita berbuat jahat sebetulnya kita telah berbuat jahat kepada atas diri kita sendiri pula

4036787 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4036788 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4036789 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4036790 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4036791 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4036792 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4036793 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4036794 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4036795 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4036796 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4036797 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4036798 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4036799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4036800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4036801 the results show not only an improvement in the grades achieved but also an increased entry to mathematics sciences and languages which are positive and encouraging developments all round
4036802 we have more and more choices for an increasingly bewildered consumer and an increasingly bewildered user in terms of industries and universities
4036803 and to be frank the thing is a complete dogs dinner
4036804 i think what you have to do is focus on the building blocks knowledge in itself is fine but the actual transferable skills are what matters and i think we have to strengthen those at every level
4036805 what the heck just happened was that just a dream
4036806 of course i am what you thought that happened didnt really happen
4036807 this place is called terra illuma for a reason those who crash on it are knocked out and go into a dream like state which makes this one of the most dangerous terras of all
4036808 because anything that happens there happens to you for real
4036809 so if we died when we were in the dream state then we would really
4036810 yes you would die for real terra illuma is one of the mostt mystierous terras of all nobody know how it does it it just does
4036811 theres not just talons but guess who descide to join them
4036812 well well well i see that you have survived the terras little trick
4036813 so it wasnt an illusion you really are back knight
4036814 of corce im back you didnt think that youve gotten ride of me now do you
4036815 im only here for one thing knight for my revenge
4036816 now now aerrow im not here for you or your storm hawks this time
4036817 so are you saying that you dont remember all those years ago
4036818 on that fathful day some many years ago i was killed i wondered the world of atmos tring to figure out what to do next what could i do to be excat i was nothing more then a wondering spirit
4036819 that was until i was dscovered by none other then
4036820 thats right he found me and said that i would be useful for his plans and i noticed that he would be useful for mine so
4036821 thats right and now not only am i alive again but i got a little present
4036822 cyla what are you doing return back to hueco mundo at once
4036823 well it looks like you got luck this time kigo but my revenge will come soon enought
4036824 weve all made mistakes in the past what ever happened between you two should be forgiven
4036825 because thats what my dad use to say to me that you should forgive and forget
4036826 thank you tsuki that makes me feel a whole lot better
4036827 wed better go inside were going to be at terra bushi tomorrow
4036828 yeah sure you go on a head ill be right there
4036829 well well well i was wondering how you knew about that
4036830 dont worry i wont tell kigo just as long as you dont tell aerrow
4036831 so do we have a deal ill help you if you help me
4036832 what the heck just happened was that just a dream
4036833 what the heck just happened was that just a dream
4036834 i dont think its the best site for them and i dont think were offering them the best service its certainly not good for the city centre
4036835 we need to help these people but i dont think were helping them by sticking them in a city centre location
4036836 these people have a genuine problem and my view is that society should help them
4036837 there are huge questions about the methadone programme as well
4036838 its actually harder to come off methadone than it is heroin
4036839 its supposed to stop addicts stealing but it doesnt always work
4036840 we need a serious review of what we do with this hostel
4036841 these are social issues why do people feel they have to turn to drugs
4036842 theres no easy answer but lets start talking about it
4036843 we would be happy to take part in any initiative that the council wanted to set up to make things better
4036844 the hostel is one of the largest in the area which in itself can draw problems to it
4036845 where james bank is at the moment there is a lot of facilities and it would be fair to say that some of the residents do become involved in shoplifting and other acts of crime within dunfermline city centre
4036846 whether or not these problems would completely vanish if it was gone would need to be carefully looked at before taking that step
4036847 if it was the correct step then i would be supportive of that and would be prepared to get involved in the management of any steps between the current situation and the new one
4036848 its always been a worry and its a worry i have raised with kingdom housing on numerous occasions
4036849 it the proposed consultation is something i would be happy to get involved in as centre manager
4036850 i called your boyfriend gay and he hit me with his purse
4036851 cest une victoire importante mais sous estimer le match retour serait une grave erreur
4036852 souvenez vous du match dartmedia face au celtic il y a quelques ann es mais nous sommes tr s heureux de ce succ s cela fait deux ans que la juve ne dispute pas de comp tition europ enne et nous voulions revenir avec la mani re nous avons tr s bien jou et r pondu aux attentes de nos fans
4036853 nous sommes tr s satisfaits du score et de notre jeu
4036854 tout l quipe a fait une belle prestation malgr le manque de temps de jeu notre rythme a baiss en fin de match mais si on continue comme a on devrait simposer l bas galement
4036855 nous avons align une quipe tr s jeune et nous navons pas paniqu notre sup riorit technique nous a permis dinscrire deux buts
4036856 cest un avantage cons quent pour le match retour mais nous allons tre sur nos gardes en premi re mi temps ils ont eu des occasions mais en seconde p riode nous avons pris le jeu notre compte ils avaient beaucoup donn en premi re ils nont pas tenu la cadence et nous ont laiss des espaces a partir de l nous avons t plus laise
4036857 je pense que nous aurions pu marquer en premi re mi temps les occasions ne sont pas si nombreuses et il faut en profiter nous ne lavons pas fait nous nous sommes d concentr s deux fois et avons t punis chaque fois cest ce qui arrive en europe contre les grandes quipes le manque dexp rience dans le vestiaire sest fait ressentir et nous devons en tirer les le ons mais nous avons inqui t arsenal surtout en premi re mi temps
4036858 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4036859 i think the key is that we both support this project
4036860 and we are working together where we have common ground
4036861 we will be able to leverage tens of millions of dollars in private donations and new federal grants to the ku cancer clinical research center
4036862 kansas state university will be able to create a world class national food safety and animal health institute in olathe which will have tremendous benefit to johnson county residents
4036863 and actually there is a way to end it the mechanism in the statute allows for the tax to end by submitted petition and then having it go to a vote so there is a way and there is an oversight committee thats done with elected officials so there are a number of good things in this statute
4036864 i think the key thing is that with the k state institution here it is a tremendous opportunity to partner with high schools throughout johnson county i think it really boosts our chances to encourage young people to go into math and science areas where we need young people in those fields because we dont have enough engineers and scientists
4036865 ive known karin a long time and always appreciated her thoughtful approach to issues even when i havent agreed with her
4036866 i observed she had made a number of really favorable comments about this project and so i decided to go and talk to her and the more we talked the more i realized she understands the triangle project as well as anyone around
4036867 i asked her if she would consider serving as honorary co chair and after thinking about it she decided to do it and im thrilled this project appeals to everyone regardless of party or ideology geography or anything else its important to johnson county
4036868 karin and i had some words back in the old blue valley school days over some disagreement on some things but when i talked to her about this she really understands and believes in the tremendous benefit this project will have to olathe
4036869 shes very straightforward absolutely dedicated to olathe and a big kansas state university fan and she believes as i do without question that this is a very substantial project for the city of olathe and johnson county
4036870 i believe that the future of the county as a whole is tied into education and this is one of the best economic investments the county will make in a long time
4036871 although this is a little different than k 12 education it is very attractive very very attractive for residents who want to work in the higher education realm or people who want to be close to a secondary education environment
4036872 the ku medical center cancer research is taking off on its own right now and will provide the basis for a lot of development
4036873 a lot of things have to happen a lot of work has to be done and all the things have to be lined up in order to develop a bioscience research triangle
4036874 once it happens the first time they come up with a cure i think were going to see the skies open up and see a lot more being done for research
4036875 ku and k state have announced scholarship programs for students from johnson county who participate in one of these research programs
4036876 im excited to be working on this its a big project and i think this is going to end up being one of the important votes in johnson county history along with the votes that created the johnson county library system and approval of the johnson county community college
4036877 i always believed that we could win this game but i would be lying if i was to say that i believed that we could win 3 0
4036878 a big congratulations needs to go out to my players
4036879 although we were not the team in control of the game we were the most effective in front of goal and thats what counts at the end of the day we defeated a big club with rich experience in europe and especially in the champions league its not easy to beat such opponents but it just goes to show what good home support can do in such games
4036880 this is just the first half and we have a very tough game ahead of us in the return leg well need to be fully prepared and fully focused if we want to secure our place in the champions league group stage
4036881 i know just how hard the return will be having played at olympiacos ground in the past in games like these one mistake can be costly so we need to be totally ready in two weeks time
4036882 its a great win but lets not forget we have one more game we still need to show some respect for olympiacos because they are a big side and will be even tougher in the return leg
4036883 anorthosis played well but the first two goals we gave away were soft i believe we can overturn this deficit although it wont be easy we created lots of chances but just couldnt score i dont feel that we are out yet
4036884 a pro active surrogate who knows the system can make the court run better
4036885 the two other candidates represent firms that have controlled the court for the past 50 years
4036886 its not tammany hall controlling the surrogates court its families and connected friends
4036887 northgate high school students have triumphed in their exam results again and continued the run of excellent results the school has produced in recent years
4036888 the year 13 students achieved an average of 875 points the equivalent of each student gaining over three a grades at a level
4036889 the success of these students is a fitting end to an excellent year for northgate
4036890 these results reflect the way that the northgate team including staff students and parents have contributed to its high achievement
4036891 we are used to our students breaking records and this years group has surpassed even the outstanding results achieved last year
4036892 two students nikola fowler from felixstowe and will harrison from tostock have achieved marks in a level subjects which place them in the top ten nationally and 46 students have achieved straight a grades in their a levels
4036893 with 58 8pc of a level passes at grade a these are our best results ever
4036894 we are absolutely thrilled to have had another year of outstanding results
4036895 we have never before had such high numbers achieve at such a high level
4036896 this is a real tribute to the hard work by a super group of students and the support they were given by their staff and parents
4036897 this is a pleasing performance coupled with some outstanding individual results at the highest level
4036898 westbourne sports college is delighted with our results this year
4036899 we have had a 50pc increase of students sitting a levels this year and a 70pc increase of students obtaining a grades
4036900 there have been exceptional results in media studies and health and social care
4036901 well done to all concerned this reflects a great deal of hard work and dedication on the part of teaching staff and students
4036902 as level results also represent a significant improvement on the previous years results
4036903 we are proud of all our students and their achievement is the result of sustained commitment and determination coupled with the support and dedication of the whole staff suffolk homes

4036905 sabemos que silva y villa son dos grandes jugadores que pueden salir de aqu pero nos gustar a que se quedasen porque son parte del valencianismo y esperemos que sigan manifest el c ntabro minutos antes de que se zanjase la continuidad del de arguinegu n a lo largo de mi carrera he encontrado a pocas personas como silva perder amos a una gran persona y a un gran jugador pero la entrada y salida de jugadores es lo que hay en el f tbol
4036906 le informazioni disponibili a questepoca sostengono basi ragionevoli per lomicidio volontario e un numero limitato di vittime di trattamenti inumani totalizzando nel complesso meno di venti persone
4036907 hemos llegado a un acuerdo total es una satisfacci n para nosotros haber comprobado la predisposici n del jugador y de sus agentes y el papel protagonista del presidente en la decisi n final que hemos alcanzado con silva
4036908 el club ha llegado hasta donde ha podido y el jugador ha bajado tambi n hasta donde consideraba necesario
4036909 el valencia tiene muy claro qu tipo de gesti n quiere llevar a cabo y no va acometer locuras ni se va a salir de las l neas generales para la estructura econ mica y deportiva actual ni para el futuro se ha llegado hasta donde se pod a ha sido un esfuerzo comedido y l gico
4036910 los jugadores echamos ra ces y aqu silva se siente importante a pesar de las posibilidades que pueda tener fuera de aqu l quiere seguir con nosotros y queremos agradec rselo
4036911 si silva hubiera salido del valencia habr a tenido d nde elegir
4036912 las dos partes quer an llegar a un acuerdo y al final se ha producido de manera satisfactoria tanto el jugador como nosotros dese bamos que siguiera muchos a os defendiendo al valencia y al final hemos llegado a un acuerdo que se preve a por las intenciones de ambas partes
4036913 lo que nos deja a todos muy contentos es anunciar que el acuerdo es total para el jugador ha sido una decisi n muy importante y hay que recalcar el esfuerzo del valencia por mantener en su plantilla a un jugador como silva
4036914 no hemos trasladado al valencia ninguna oferta porque la prioridad del jugador era seguir aqu siempre y cuando se llegara a este acuerdo no bamos a revolver en temas que no ven an a cuento es importante que todos sepamos que el valencia ha hecho un esfuerzo muy grande y que el jugador ha mantenido esa prioridad desde el principio
4036915 le consider bamos un jugador interesante pero si no hay salida no hay negociaci n y por lo tanto no hay jugador
4036916 aqu el jugador se siente importante a pesar de las otras posibilidades que pudiera tener
4036917 no va a cometer locuras ni se va a salir de las lineas marcadas
4036918 ellos han subido hasta donde han podido y el jugador ha bajado considerablemente
4036919 no ibamos a revolver con temas que no ven an a cuento
4036920 el jugador hubiera tenido donde elegir si hubiera salido del valencia
4036921 la evoluci n de los jugadores pide en momentos determinados una revisi n como la de ahora
4036922 si el jugador sigue rindiendo y el club piensa que merece una mejora se har
4036923 kaun kehta hai asman mein surakh nahi ek patthar to tabiyat se uchalo yaaro
4036924 the government has to take the issue seriously now it is becoming a litmus test of browns ability to show leadership in the country and reconnect with a demoralised party
4036925 revenues from the tax should be ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
4036926 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards therefore much of the money raised should be used to kick start a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor
4036927 congratulations your place at the university of warwick w20 to study history v100 has been confirmed

4036930 when we first saw stumpy in hervey bay in 2001 we thought for sure he wouldnt survive without his tail
4036931 its a 20 000 kilometre return journey when they migrate and that is an amazing feat for a whale without a tail
4036932 its important to focus on the present this is a young team but weve behaved maturely and it happened naturally were able to handle things
4036933 i didnt feel sharp the last time i pitched here
4036934 i wanted to be aggressive and stay aggressive that really worked out i feel like if i stick to my game plan it sets me up for success
4036935 his last two outings are as good as ive seen him in a long time hes always been a winner
4036936 asia is definitely a force to reckon with in international boxing there are several asian countries coming up with so many talented boxers they have indeed improved a lot
4036937 i have not seen them but what i know is that they are coming up and the way they are coming up means they have a lot of potentials and might be top boxers in future
4036938 in recent days there have been several instances of pillaging yesterday our police executed two pillagers on the scene
4036939 today we plan to be tougher in addressing this problem
4036940 bale will have to admit guilt to get a caution when he answers bail next month
4036941 a mixture of a weaker us dollar and stronger commodity prices helped buoy the aussie dollar
4036942 domestic developments played second fiddle to the aussie dollars price action
4036943 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4036944 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4036945 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows
4036946 american history race relations sociology law business marketing ethics philosophy decision making religion discrimination law enforcement even lawn care
4036947 i should group the three organizational racism scenarios together because theyre so similar
4036948 i saw the costellos a couple of weeks ago and theyre in good form theyre both very healthy and happy and thats nice and i hope they have a very nice day
4036949 im not getting into that off limits not talking good try but i saw it coming
4036950 i will be putting pen to paper at some point yes
4036951 they will be an attempt to put in a longer term historical perspective the events of more than 33 years of public life
4036952 i will at some time have something to say in more details about the achievements of my government and things more generally
4036953 in the end all of us in public life will be judged by history and im no different from anybody else
4036954 there will be an increased focus on limiting the number of suppliers we sign contracts with the idea is to work more in partnerships to have a better economic and strategic view of the services being provided
4036955 fifteen would be ideal we want firms that can understand our strategy and work with us in the long term
4036956 we had plenty of meetings where we illustrated our new strategic plan by using our internal expertise but sometimes it is hard to force some people to do exactly as they are told
4036957 we expect limited impact on overall passenger vehicles and car sales growth in china given the relatively low market share of the affected engine sizes
4036958 newspapers are printed on paper that is of a lesser quality and that made it difficult for us to get advertisers
4036959 we hope that the verve magazine will bring considerable added value to all carrier newspapers as well as to advertisers verve is considered the pulsating heart of the star it provides the energy and information to help readers make sense of their lives they love its lively beautiful pages and its thought provoking compelling articles

4036961 people say governor and he looks and says whos here because hes not expecting that
4036962 the jury didnt believe the flight attendant in the osteen case after all
4036963 we do have credible reports that russia has taken actions that violate the cease fire agreement and thats what the president was referring to
4036964 i cant get into specifics but we do have those reports and were concerned about them and we are working to get concrete information its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
4036965 it is very difficult to get accurate in real time in a crisis that is fast moving
4036966 this is a motorized conflict in a relatively small area and that means the situation on the ground can change very quickly
4036967 i think this is a significant lack of policy and analysis
4036968 i think the administration has most of what they need
4036969 im sure we have a lot more information than theyre discussing publicly

4036972 kenny chesney is in terms of attendance the top touring act in north america over the past five years in any genre
4036973 as the impact of traditional advertising models decreases sponsors are increasingly looking to live music as a way to reach consumers in an efficient targeted manner country music fans are very highly regarded by brands as loyal active consumers given the images of both in my opinion chesney and corona are a natural fit
4036974 this will be a seven year deal including a five year tour sponsorship
4036975 we already filmed the first two commercials down in tulum mexico a few months ago
4036976 we approached kennys team a while back about the idea of exploring various projects that might be a good fit for both kenny and corona
4036977 as we began these discussions it became very clear in very short order that this would be a perfect fit for both parties and we just kicked things off this year
4036978 the term partnership really is the most accurate description of the relationship between kenny and corona in that it goes well beyond your standard tour sponsorship
4036979 the partnership involves a whole range of activities including advertising campaigns digital initiatives and retail programs in fact we introduced the tv commercials with kenny this spring
4036980 they are selling the same message we are they get our vision and we get theirs as well corona personifies escape
4036981 if you want to capture my audience the thing that stands out is their ability to have more fun in a single day than most people have in a month
4036982 corona is part of those relaxed hanging out with your buddies kinds of days
4036983 some sponsorships are just about cashing a check but not this one
4036984 as we continue to figure out ways to grow the kenny chesney brand this is going to be a big piece of the puzzle the vision of the two brands intersects very well they refer to the brand as a vacation in a bottle and we refer to ours as a vacation on the stage and when you can marry those two brands so well it just makes sense i mean its not like kennys selling cheez whiz or something
4036985 songs like old blue chair beer in mexico no shoes no shirt no problems all speak to the laid back island vibe that kenny articulates so well in much of his music
4036986 its that same attitude and persona that corona has been communicating over the years so although there are a number of obvious reasons we would love to work with an artist of kenny chesneys stature that one would certainly be right at the top of the list
4036987 i cant think of an artist more devoted to his fans than kenny chesney
4036988 its an amazing thing to experience that connection between kenny and his audience at a live show and for corona to be part of that is really exciting it has much less to do with demographics and target audiences than it has to do with the level of involvement and enthusiasm that comes out of that whole experience
4036989 these results are excellent and we congratulate all students on their achievement
4036990 the results show not only an improvement in the grades achieved but also an increased entry for maths sciences and languages which are positive and encouraging developments all round
4036991 as with every year some people will inevitably claim that a levels are getting easier but we shouldnt really take away from the hard work of those students who have done well in their results today
4036992 it is difficult to compare the a levels of today with those of 40 years ago as the world is quite a different place
4036993 people will be shocked to see that there are areas of the country where fewer than one in eight children sit a levels as ever it is the poorest areas that are worst affected
4036994 this back of a fag packet maths adds nothing to the picture on a levels and completely ignores the fact that many youngsters travel between boroughs to do their a levels do other qualifications or work based training or apprenticeships
4036995 for example according to these flawed figures kensington and chelsea apparently has 193 of their pupils studying a levels all this shows is that some boroughs have lots of pupils travelling to do their a levels which is very common
4036996 the fact is more young people are staying on in education than ever before
4036997 rather than painting a picture of doom and gloom the tories should be preparing to congratulate pupils on their hard work
4036998 they come to see if i can stay on my feet
4036999 we were lucky not to concede a goal clearly we did not play well the performance was poor but the result was good
4037000 its always important not to concede away from home and the second leg in anfield has to make a massive difference
4037001 the players know the performance was bad and sometimes you dont need to say too much to them because everybody knows
4037002 our belief in tolerance and liberty our commitment to fairness fair play and civic duty
4037003 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
4037004 we are concerned that drink does play a part in a number of these situations
4037005 people from all the countries weve looked at have increased levels of alcohol use when theyre traveling abroad theyre treating every night like a friday or saturday night the reality unfortunately is that the levels of drunkenness among britons are higher and thats led to some of the alcohol related problems were familiar with
4037006 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps
4037007 empty condom packet amp a photo of the tarts knickers
4037008 the next item that will probably be sold on ebay at a start price of 99c and of course with no reserve
4037009 we let her know about the policy and instead shes now selling a photograph of the offending knickers
4037010 ebay does connect colourful buyers with colourful sellers and i wouldnt be surprised if someone did buy these items though i couldnt speculate on who would buy them or why
4037011 this is obviously very therapeutic for this woman and it must be a great channel for her views on cheating and the sanctity of marriage
4037012 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4037013 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4037014 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4037015 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4037016 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4037017 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4037018 weve got more violence and now we dont know who to talk to about it
4037019 we are deeply concerned because it leaves the radical extremist outfits free to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghanistan border but clearly our side of the border too
4037020 its not like theres suddenly going to be a war between the two countries
4037021 in the absence of greater trust you will see a kind of pincer movement against pakistan by afghanistan and india and pakistans establishment and state turning toward whatever tools it has at its disposal to defend itself
4037022 we made more progress in terms of peace than we have in the past 60 years
4037023 how can we get talks back on track if the prime minister the other people we meet with cant control the military the intelligence services
4037024 india did not try to draw mileage on that and get an outline for a real agreement
4037025 we missed the opportunity and we wont get another right now
4037026 campaign contributions from oil industry executives to sen john mccain rose dramatically in the last half of june after the senator from arizona made a high profile split with environmentalists and reversed his opposition to the federal ban on offshore drilling oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to mccain last month three quarters of which came after his june 16 speech calling for an end to the ban compared with 116 000 in march 283 000 in april and 208 000 in may
4037027 having said that i definitely agree that huffpo summaries with read more links to the full story like this should not be dugg up or perhaps even submitted to digg huffpo is just an intermediary in this case their content is not original and the source site should be submitted instead huffpo doesnt deserve the traffic diggs or a frontpage for just aggregating original content imo its lame
4037028 we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender
4037029 keep that faith keep your courage stick together stay strong do not yield do not flinch stand up were americans and well never surrender
4037030 i probably should have mentioned what you all already know these are tough times
4037031 the extradition procedure is difficult complicated and time consuming and we cannot predict the timetable
4037032 we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4037033 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples cooperation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4037034 we have been under siege for the last two years
4037035 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4037036 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4037037 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4037038 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen

4037044 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialization of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinization of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
4037045 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering

4037054 must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4037055 the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4037056 will now need to review the full range of our relations

4037063 if we are able to have continued access in terms of humanitarian supplies to these people if there is safe space for the civilians in that area if both sides respect their responsibility to allow displaced people to move where they want to move they i think a crisis can be avoided
4037064 the ethnic majority sinhala nation is intent on occupying and enslaving the tamil homeland

4037094 you have a mix of blonds and brunettes and all different cuisines
4037095 there were thousands of girls spilling out to the street screaming
4037096 while these services will be a powerful force in our lives they are a potential privacy nightmare
4037097 the only thing i care about that ive ever done
4037098 i remember a couple of occasions when i thought i did my job when i was hitting in front of him and he started yelling at me
4037099 i think i hit a sacrifice fly when there were runners on second and third he got upset and said i was supposed to hit to rightfield
4037100 they were balls that were hitting scoreboards and he did it with ease
4037101 he was a big guy who didnt swing at a lot of bad pitches kind of like sheffield
4037102 you sit in bed and the plays go through your mind the guys and what they are doing
4037103 you get some sort of mental reps i guess its tough when you see all your guys out there the meetings are tough youre watching film and youre trying hard not to critique somebody else but the only time you stay interested in the film is when youre on there
4037104 i had a lot of snacks in the room and i tried not to doodle too much
4037105 theres a few pictures that i drew on the wall i just put some tape on the wall i like to doodle for one week i worked on this little mural of a wave and a sunset over a wave
4037106 they see its there they know its there because every time id fall asleep id start drawing again
4037107 hes a real soft spoken guy not one to be the center of attention
4037108 hes a veteran player whos been around hes been around all off season when we installed the offense and everything we did the first part of camp was redundant without him coming out here and practicing its a little bit different situation but he found ways to keep busy we have a couple murals on the wall in our meeting room that he put up im just glad hes out here
4037109 if youre ever in the o line room youll see the sign now says be back in february
4037110 were just a competitive football team thats good were not going to get into specifics thats how competitors are its been a long camp todays really the last day and were just ready to start seeing other people on a weekly basis
4037111 kits taking care of his players and guys are ready to hit somebody else he probably would have got knocked out so i would have rather he just stayed back and be the quarterback
4037112 i dont want penalties self control thats what you like but the extra curricular i dont want that but i understand guys standing up for each other well be a good team when we dont have penalties were smart tough physical and dont make mistakes thats what i want
4037113 weve learned to work hard work smart and help each other out
4037114 bo knew how to change lives for the better he did it very well
4037115 they dont really have all the tools to make the right decisions thats necessary in todays society and they dont fully understand the system
4037116 the entire conversation and the entire desires were initiated by mr barany
4037117 it was very transparent that it was a 13 year old girl and it was very transparent that he was engaging in this conversation to at some point engage in a lewd act with her
4037118 as a teacher he really is a trusted member of the community and he couldnt have done anything worse to break that trust
4037119 theyre constantly monitoring web sites dealing with financial fraud identity theft and sites that may engage in exploitation of children
4037120 go ahead and do what the police normally do under these circumstances
4037121 then and from a distance i admired very much the way she handled a uniquely difficult situation with uncomplaining grace
4037122 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
4037123 she got to the point where she could joke about it
4037124 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
4037125 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
4037126 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
4037127 together these two fire seasons dramatically illustrate a new level of wildland fire in the united states
4037128 two percent of our fires account for 98 percent of our costs big fires are costly fires
4037129 im a smart guy im not saying im a coach or anything but i know our defense needs rest if we can run the ball keep the clock moving and let our defense be in a good position there you go
4037130 if we can start breaking those four or five or six yard runs its gonna bring that safety down and then were one on one on the outside
4037131 right now i feel like marvin harrison and reggie wayne are the standard bearers
4037132 i would love to put us up there but youve also got t j houshmandzadeh and chad johnson in the mix with the bengals
4037133 as for us we need to prove ourselves as a duo but we do pose a threat on paper so well see
4037134 environmental conditions are only marginally favorable for development and the potential for tropical cyclone formation in the next day or two has decreased
4037135 it is not out of the question to see a strong tropical storm or a minimal hurricane near the southeastern bahamas by late sunday
4037136 forecasts rapid intensification on tuesday and wednesday as it turns northward into the eastern gulf of mexico and comes ashore in the florida panhandle next thursday
4037137 we know that the fraudulent activity is going on but its rare that we would find a location where those things are manufactured
4037138 i am not sure he can stop doing this to people
4037139 what if another temptation presented itself has he really learned his lesson i really doubt it
4037140 i think he is a predator who targets elders because they are an easy mark
4037141 hopefully something more severe happens to him this time i dont think hes ever going to learn
4037142 my guess is for the near future that one wing of the building will probably be unusable
4037143 but they are not they dont know who is the president of georgia i am sure
4037144 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4037145 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4037146 i walked over and found a disaster bodies on the ground some mangled some wounded it was awful
4037147 my mother is in heaven and i know she will forgive him
4037148 his actions are not the kind that i can forgive
4037149 we want to make sure this area is safe for you
4037150 and we want to make sure you get as expeditiously across the street as you can
4037151 one officer asked me in english what were my views of tibet
4037152 i told him i was a journalist and didnt have any views
4037153 one of our chinese staff asked why they arrested me and an officer said didnt you see
4037154 pointing to the yellow cloth they had thrown into the van
4037155 i was there merely to report not to take part in anything i didnt have a banner i didnt have a t shirt i was wearing pretty standard foreign correspondent garb

4037157 these are the kids we might end up dealing with on the streets five or six years from now
4037158 it gives us a lot of positive feeling of hope
4037159 helps kids see us as having life experiences like theirs
4037160 thats when they break down their walls and learn to share things
4037161 they can open up they can reach their goals and dreams
4037162 were killed as they came under fire from unknown gunmen
4037163 we dont value their aid projects and we dont think they are working for the progress of our country
4037164 this situation has forced many aid agencies to restrict the scale and scope of their development and humanitarian operations
4037165 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance
4037166 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4037167 i think its really great news for those of us who are baby boomers

4037169 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4037170 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
4037171 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over
4037172 it does suggest that diversity in this country is hitting the whole population more rapidly especially in the younger population
4037173 we have all these set notions of who works in what area and what type of person is employed in certain areas
4037174 well the population is going to be a whole lot more diverse in 20 to 30 years were going to have to retrain people to do different jobs
4037175 even if we had not projected an increase in immigration the natural increase of the hispanic population is quite a bit higher than the non hispanic population
4037176 if you are concerned about congestion pollution sprawl or preservation of open space
4037177 if you drive on the roads of california this is really bad news but if you sell cars to the people of california its not necessarily bad news

4037183 they are there to neutralize a huge arsenal of arms and military hardware which they found there totally abandoned it was necessary to neutralize them in order not to create a threat for civilians

4037188 three doctors and three patients in a little room and believe me the room aint clean and it isnt adequately equipped
4037189 in support of our continued improvements to the playstation store we will be implementing a search by a z category within the store
4037190 nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror
4037191 television science fiction has got too self consciously jokey lately
4037192 if you wanted to sum up the relative position of britain and america in this century the ebbing away of the pink areas of the map the fading of national self confidence as uncle sam proceeded to colonise the globe with fizzy drinks and hollywood you could do it like this they had
4037193 blakes 7 has acquired a credibility and popularity terry nation can never have expected i think its to do with the sheer crappiness of the series and the crappiness it attributes to the universe it is science fiction for the disillusioned and ironic and that is what makes it so very british
4037194 the premise of blakes 7 held nothing remotely original the outlaw group resisting a powerful and corrupt regime is an idea familiar from robin hood and beyond
4037195 blakes 7 s triumph lay in its vivid characters its tight pacey plots and its satisfying realism for arguably the first time since the 1950s quatermass serials the bbc had created a popular sci fi fantasy show along adult lines
4037196 ultimately the one force the rebels could not overcome proved to be the bbcs long standing apathy towards science fiction however the bloody finale in which avon murders blake exemplified the programmes strengths fearless narratives credible but surprising character development and an enormous sense of fun
4037197 20 years on tv sf is still mapping the paths first explored by terry nations baby
4037198 did not feel the documentary provided a proper tribute or fresh retrospective of the show
4037199 the time is ripe for a revival of a show that represents the best traditions of the genre not to mention one of the best loved and most successful dramas of all time elaine pyke commissioning editor for drama at sky one two and three said
4037200 i would like there to be a little more transparency
4037201 if you talk to teachers in the district they feel very unappreciated
4037202 the only way were going to get through all this and get back to focusing on educating our kids is to talk collegially
4037203 i want to make sure all parties are represented and can have functional communication between them
4037204 and hashem commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it
4037205 whether targets the answer i dont know im hoping we can find a solution and find a way to bring in revenue
4037206 im not a happy camper with how things have been going
4037207 what needs to happen is the city needs to have a smart growth policy
4037208 im not going to take a position on target in this race
4037209 id like to find an answer for the greatest good of everyone involved
4037210 the city has a lot of development and economic issues pressing them
4037211 the concentration should be on providing a good environment for business to thrive in
4037212 we want to do something to make it a more rational and reasonable area for pedestrians and bikers as well as cars
4037213 that area is a real gem and this is a wonderful improvement
4037214 thanks a lot for bringing the lousy weather with you
4037215 i bet you werent too happy about our dollar matching yours
4037216 at least i dont have to worry about doing the conversion
4037217 the homes are all in very good repair and painted really very nice
4037218 it wasnt all that long ago that sunday shopping was taboo in nova scotia
4037219 it was only this past year in new york that we allowed liquor stores to be open sunday
4037220 in new york thats all you hear horns even on the neighbourhood roads
4037221 you pay six bucks just for half an hour to park
4037222 what youre saying is we dont know how lucky we are in nova scotia
4037223 i need to come up to nova scotia every few years just to restore my sanity and my faith in people
4037224 i had a little i guess you could call it a sleepover with someone i had known for a while
4037225 wed always had girlfriends or boyfriends and then we both came to the games single and after our events were over it was kind of like oh were both single it just sort of happened
4037226 you get a lot of people who are in shape and you know testosterones up and everybodys attracted to everybody
4037227 everybodys fit beyond belief and were all definitely red blooded humans that want to meet each other
4037228 we were walking through the athletes village and the italian girls came over to me and said so and so sent you an e mail and shes over there and she really wants to meet you
4037229 i know a lot of couples where one flies home to canada one flies home to italy the next day
4037230 its kind of like going to las vegas what happens there stays there
4037231 i found it very professional i think people like to think of it as a big party an orgy or whatever
4037232 but theyre not really experienced partiers people who have dedicated their whole lives to running they have a couple drinks and they get a little bit crazy
4037233 they put you in university style dorms and theres usually two single beds in the room so that was kind of weird because were used to sleeping together
4037234 i know that sounds kind of silly because youre in the same room but just to reach over and hold his hand or touch him and make sure hes there i needed that
4037235 its not really something youre thinking about whether youre with your husband or not
4037236 it was something along the lines of i awoke to a rustling under the cover at 6 52 and then there was a quote of max saying i know she couldnt work too hard because she had to conserve her energy
4037237 and max said in german this was his quote and the only quote we gave from those olympic games regarding us being together if she wins you can write whatever you want
4037238 i never gave a quote i would never give a quote
4037239 since 92 the men remember that im the girl who did it and the women remember that my husband cried on cbc
4037240 if i was a hollywood star i would have sued or something
4037241 hes a british citizen vietnam wants him to go back to the uk
4037242 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4037243 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4037244 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4037245 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4037246 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4037247 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4037248 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4037249 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4037250 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4037251 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4037252 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4037253 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4037254 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4037255 tutti quanti e tutti iniziano a cantare anke da morti evviva tornato topo gigio
4037256 what are my readers wants desires needs characteristics concerns problems what do i need to know to help influence them
4037257 it was the best of times it was the worst of times
4037258 i keep six honest serving men they taught me all i know their names are what and why and when and how and where and who
4037259 mastering the art of persuasion what can make you who rich beyond your wildest dreams why in just few short years when if you will simply commit to practicing these influence skills for 45 minutes a day how which can be done in the comfort of your home when you have a few spare minutes to write where
4037260 while doing research in persuasion for my doctoral thesis i discovered
4037261 according to a research study done at ucla 93 of communication is non verbal
4037262 imagine stepping out your back door onto the warm sand and looking out to a brilliant orange sunset feeling a warm breeze on your face as gulls fly overhead and then walking along the beach taking in that special smell of the salt air watching the deep blue water well up into giant frothy waves breaking along the coast for as far as the eye can see
4037263 would you like to know the two greatest headlines ever written
4037264 youll be surprised to discover how you can make even more money than you thought your would
4037265 the more you find yourself questioning your ability to influence with these techniques the more youll realize just how effective they really are
4037266 then and from a distance i admired very much the way she handled a uniquely difficult situation with uncomplaining grace
4037267 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
4037268 she got to the point where she could joke about it
4037269 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
4037270 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
4037271 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
4037272 yomi this business that we have gone into is n10 million profit we want you to determine how we are going to do it yes yes in fact the money would even be ready later today
4037273 we want to interpret that we want to look at that first
4037274 ok take the salient issues and let us tackle them
4037275 let us think together how do we do it is it in this form or that form
4037276 no one individual is more powerful than the community if the community agrees that this thing we will not be allowed to happen no matter the strength of two three four ten people you cant do it
4037277 look food is coming employment is coming this thing is coming road construction is going on
4037278 dont worry im going to give you n1 million at the end of the month
4037279 silvester auf dem dach eines hochhauses pech dass gleich vier menschen auf die idee gekommen sind sich dort das leben zu nehmen
4037280 i think its really great news for those of us who are baby boomers
4037281 so much of climate change policy is not really environment policy these days
4037282 its about things like dealing with competition concerns and allocating carbon allowances
4037283 setting up a whole dg on climate change would throw a shadow on other environmental issues
4037284 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
4037285 it does suggest that diversity in this country is hitting the whole population more rapidly especially in the younger population
4037286 we have all these set notions of who works in what area and what type of person is employed in certain areas
4037287 well the population is going to be a whole lot more diverse in 20 to 30 years were going to have to retrain people to do different jobs
4037288 even if we had not projected an increase in immigration the natural increase of the hispanic population is quite a bit higher than the non hispanic population
4037289 if you are concerned about congestion pollution sprawl or preservation of open space
4037290 if you drive on the roads of california this is really bad news but if you sell cars to the people of california its not necessarily bad news
4037291 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4037292 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4037293 na het grote succes van vorig jaar pakken de antwerpse musea opnieuw uit met hun niet te missen nu al klassieke
4037294 as es como se supone que debe de ir montado a una librer a
4037295 but i would suggest that thats still nowhere near good enough in terms of what the government would like in a competitive mortgage market
4037296 one can only speculate why superannuation funds are not involved in this but they make their own decisions
4037297 it has given the big retail banks a fantastic opportunity to increase pricing on various products
4037298 having a central account number system would be a costly exercise and which every way you look at it someone will have to pay for it
4037299 rail in the 21st century is the best option just as it was when it was first introduced in the 19th century
4037300 we need to brand rail greenhouse friendly if were going to make it click and work right now
4037301 a number of lines are now unusable because of neglect farmers are having to transport silos a long way away because of it
4037302 weve got to come up with a system that is efficient can handle perishable products and is cost effective
4037303 lets be frank rail is a capital intensive fixed cost business and we must pay high prices for it
4037304 the premier spending a week or two there in china doesnt hide the fact nsw is unrepresented for the remaining 50 weeks of the year
4037305 given the huawei deal alone is a multi million agreement for sydney the cost of the mission is relatively small
4037306 this is a solid half year result underpinned by double digit revenue and ebitda growth
4037307 while the advertising segment shows relatively less growth in the first half of the year the segment was recovering from the loss of key clients in 2007 and has been boosted by new business wins in the larger agencies
4037308 we are focused on all aspects of the business which we can control in particular managing variable costs
4037309 we remain vigilant of any softening of economic conditions in the last quarter of 2008
4037310 like most businesses we are naturally cautious about the economic outlook
4037311 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
4037312 we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
4037313 pakistan is passing through a very critical moment in its history and our enemies are trying to weaken us externally and internally
4037314 our democratic coalition government has adopted a policy of reconciliation we should move forward for national progress
4037315 the period of oppression is over forever dictatorship has become a story of the past
4037316 committed to bringing relief to the common man to steer pakistan out of the current political economic situation
4037317 i am pleased to announce on independence day that the impeachment process is moving fast and is on the right track
4037318 the russians have started to withdraw the georgian police and special forces are taking control
4037319 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
4037320 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
4037321 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
4037322 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4037323 in recent days there have been several instances of pillaging yesterday our police executed two pillagers on the scene
4037324 today we plan to be tougher in addressing this problem
4037325 rocky elsom is obviously in doubt for the first one and dean has the ability to play and to cover in that position as well as hugh has
4037326 nathan has done well to date but it came down to a call between dan and nathan
4037327 its obviously very disappointing for him in saying that sometimes you get an opportunity and he has a break and gets back with his wife and i believe she is due in two or three weeks so thats a slight positive but hes very disappointed at the moment
4037328 i certainly hope so sharpey has been a huge part of this team for a long period of time and you only have to look at how much he has contributed to the force in particular this year how well hes played for their team
4037329 ive got no doubt he will be back in the wallabies soon
4037330 innocent victims of john brumbys governments ineptitude and inactivity thats your common bond
4037331 you must believe that you can win this the toxic waste dump at mildura was going to be built until the eve of the day when the government said it had abandoned it it took three years to win that fight
4037332 this is all about shattered dreams and its about aspirations that people have had for their own land that they have owned for a long time in many cases
4037333 this crime was rampant and thats not to say it doesnt still exist
4037334 its organised crime presence is most apparent in the betting ring where the laundering of the proceeds of crime had been commonplace
4037335 the recommendations in this report are designed to address the problem although i acknowledge that it is not easy to combat what has been historically a tolerance of criminality
4037336 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4037337 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4037338 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4037339 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4037340 and i think ridge is a great example of that
4037341 far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights you know a number of other issues
4037342 i dont think that anything is going to change but i do think it is important to be heard and this is our way of doing it
4037343 senator clinton understands and appreciates that there are supporters who remain passionate but she has repeatedly urged her supporters to vote for senator obama
4037344 i think some of her supporters have been less than gracious
4037345 you are right joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama
4037346 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
4037347 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
4037348 i have been voting democratic for 18 years i will be voting for someone other than barack obama come november
4037349 the real economic data is undeniable the economy is slowing really sharply and to forecast inflation below target in two years time was a huge signal
4037350 will they cut rates next month well you cant rule it out with the signal they have sent
4037351 increases in food and energy bills will intensify the squeeze on real take home pay which for many households is unlikely to grow this year
4037352 these are circumstances in which consumer spending and house prices are likely to weaken together
4037353 more pronounced slowdown in activity is likely to be necessary to contain wage and price pressures and ensure inflation expectations are anchored in the medium term
4037354 as both the government and the bank of england have recognised the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high energy and food prices we know the impact that this is having on people here and will continue to support families and business through these tougher times but the fundamentals of the uk economy remain strong the government stands behind the 2 inflation target and will continue to support the banks decisions to ensure inflation comes back to target
4037355 it is very difficult to see how a weakening government with minimal political authority is going to stagger though next year when economic conditions are deteriorating
4037356 after the inflation report what were seeing is the realisation from real money managers that theres no potential for a rate hike and that its brought forward the possibility for a rate cut leading to sterling weakness
4037357 harry made a mistake in backing those two and now hes trying to figure out how to rectify it
4037358 her ego wont stand for that shed be humiliated if she stayed there
4037359 current management structure for ua has not changed tom and paula are still running the day to day operations
4037360 from the moment tom and paula got their money sloan has been desperately trying to get his hands on it
4037361 when we first saw stumpy in hervey bay in 2001 we thought for sure he wouldnt survive without his tail
4037362 its a 20 000 kilometre return journey when they migrate and that is an amazing feat for a whale without a tail
4037363 hi this is so and so from your insurance company
4037364 did you know youre eligible for a new glucose meter every year
4037365 ok but i really dont need one i can get one whenever i want my doctors office gives them out
4037366 ok well they can lose accuracy after a year so ask your doctor for a new one
4037367 hi this is the doctors office we have your blood test results everything was normal
4037368 oh youre way too young to have to worry about that
4037369 i want to know the actual result so i can see if my meter is accurate
4037370 hi this is the doctors office we have your blood test results everything was normal
4037371 oh youre way too young to have to worry about that
4037372 diabetes technology hopes for the new year and a belated response to amy

4037375 we want the grand parkway to be a reality in galveston county as landowners we cant continue to pay taxes and not do anything for the property we need to make a deal with the county and city
4037376 we tore it down at the same time of the storm there were no lights the building was falling down and shook the ground and the entire fire department came around here and some people were scared
4037377 compared to some of the hoops the city makes others jump through theyre not making this guy do anything
4037378 easter break exercise 3 richard williams breakdown smile to frown applied to generi
4037379 the osce welcomes kazakhstans recent efforts to improve the penitentiary system at the same time more needs to be done to further develop the legislation the medical care system for prisoners and the interaction and co operation with civil society
4037380 it is necessary to ensure maximum transparency of all penitentiary facilities and guarantee the rights of prisoners in accordance with international human rights standards
4037381 from 2000 to 2004 kazakhstan has accomplished several legislative and institutional reforms that allowed prison conditions to be improved considerably however there is concern over the growth of prisoners in the past two years and the lack of probation services and a system of alternative punishments there is a need for a balanced consistent penal policy under the justice ministrys civil unit which could be elaborated in close co operation with civil society to tackle current problems and to adequately respond to challenges ahead
4037382 estou convencido que portugal estaria bem pior se a ac o governativa n o tivesse demonstrado o zelo a compet ncia e a coragem que demonstrou

4037385 fitting square pegs into round holes the challenge of coping with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
4037386 the results suggested a reciprocal relationship between young people and their social context with the challenges of adhd formulated as a mismatch between the two young people were like square pegs trying to fit into rigid round holes this vicious cycle led young people to feel out of control and have low self esteem adhd was experienced as less challenging when the environment was adaptable and flexible and when young people experienced the support and acceptance of others

4037411 selain sebagai mufti syeikh nuruddin juga seorang penulis yang menyanggah wujudiyah seringkali ia mengadakan perdebatan dengan penganut ajaran ini dan kadang kadang majelis diskusi diakadakan di istana dimana sultan sendiri menyaksikannya dalam perdebatan itu syeikh nuruddin berkali kali memperlihatkan adanya kelemahan dan penyimpangan dalam ajaran wujudiyah serta meminta agar mereka ini bertobat tetapi himbauannya tidak dihiraukan mereka dan akhirnya mereka dihukum kafir yang boleh dibunuh sedangkan kitab kitab karangan hamzah dan syamsuddin dikumpulkan dan kemudian dibakar di halaman mesjid raya baiturrahman

4037466 mark zuckerberg dropped an indication that facebook is considering opening up at some point while there was no mention of when that would occur the fact that they are considering an opening of their network is significant by opening up their platform to make identities transportable will help them to become a google competitor without opening their platform facebook is indeed risking becoming a fad conversely the older generations presence on facebook is expanding rapidly and this generation is known to stick with the sites that they use while it is impossible to say what would happen if facebook falls off their high horse that they are currently riding or what will happen when google launches their social platform facebook does have a shot at becoming an industry leader its as simple as that facebook now needs to make all the right moves and currently they have a board of advisors that can help them execute successfully if facebook does indeed decide to make identities transportable i believe they could become the center hub for a large portion of identities online

4037474 today blood is being shed and people are perishing in south ossetia and my heart deeply grieves over it orthodox christians are among those who have raised their hands against each other orthodox peoples called by the lord to live in fraternity and love are in conflict
4037475 the use of force in the dispute over south ossetia and abkhazia has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilising a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond

4037481 a cultural demand for individualism in societies with nowhere to place it
4037482 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
4037483 they were unarmed obviously there was not a military convoy in sight and it is utterly reprehensible that they should be killed in this brutal inexplicable fashion
4037484 she was an expert in her field phd an internationally recognized authority on education education for women and girls especially in conflict settings
4037485 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
4037486 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
4037487 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
4037488 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
4037489 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
4037490 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
4037491 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity
4037492 both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility
4037493 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
4037494 she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heart broken and utterly grief stricken by her loss

4037507 yahoo offers best mobile web experience as interest in web 2 0 outstrips media industry content
4037508 yahoo mobile achieved the highest rating primarily due to the fact that it represented the best replication of the full website on the third mobile screen
4037509 however mobile implementation of these brands is tangibly inferior to the fixed user experience across a range of metrics
4037510 many users especially among digital enthusiasts show a preference for web search web mail and web 2 0 user generated content and social networking content over branded content however ease of access and discoverability of content on mobile handsets continue to be a huge pain point which is directly limiting content consumption

4037516 hilarys boat the artemis 20 has been sailed under testing conditions the integrated navigation and control system is a combination of off the shelf items and custom built electronics as a system it is still in development and working in what for electronics is a hostile environment what we had not envisaged was the level of difficulty operating and maintaining the boat and her systems under the conditions we have faced the weather has often stopped us sailing and this has been an added frustration
4037517 i am obviously extremely disappointed and incredibly frustrated that we have not been able to complete the sail this year it seems that the fates have conspired against us but i am now ever more determined to go again next year we always said that every mile we sailed would be an achievement in its own right and we have to try and take some positives from this years efforts i have enjoyed the wonderful experience of night sailing and the tranquillity and sense of freedom that brings i also feel incredibly privileged and proud to have been supported by such a great crew who despite extremely testing conditions and circumstances continued to show commitment and resilience of the highest order

4037582 we saw a switch in focus from the bank of england which is now seeing through short term inflation problems this is what sent sterling spinning

4037595 we want people to think of it as a boutique hotel lifestyle in an urban environment
4037596 when youre in the distillery district its like youre on vacation its a quiet environment where you dont see the hustle and bustle of the city

4037608 i wanted to turn it into a home that would make us feel like we are on vacation when we come home after a day at work
4037609 so the only thing we could do was to get cash advances on our credit cards for the down payment
4037610 usually you get doors to fit your cabinets we built cabinets to fit the doors
4037611 they were old and rickety and it was a labour of love to restore them
4037612 the dens far too small theres no way you could pull a chair out
4037613 i would hire a designer to draw up new plans and go first class with this
4037614 for example the whole kitchen could be done in a french country style with cupboards and a new pantry along the exterior wall painted in a moss green and white combination
4037615 from roman times to the mid 20th century the entrance to a home has been a welcoming place here we have a hole in the wall with a toilet view
4037616 id place a narrow console table against the back of the short part and on it id have a pair of lovely table lamps and either a sculpture or a fabulous bouquet between them
4037617 i would keep the walls light either a white with a slight blue tint if peter prefers a cool crisp ambience or white with a yellow or coral tint if he wants to add warmth to the place
4037618 there were numerous niagara escarpment commission and toronto and region conservation regulations to conform to it was a huge amount of work

4037622 rail in the 21st century is the best option just as it was when it was first introduced in the 19th century
4037623 we need to brand rail greenhouse friendly if were going to make it click and work right now
4037624 a number of lines are now unusable because of neglect farmers are having to transport silos a long way away because of it
4037625 weve got to come up with a system that is efficient can handle perishable products and is cost effective
4037626 lets be frank rail is a capital intensive fixed cost business and we must pay high prices for it
4037627 it happened with naguib mahfouz too egyptian nobel prize winner he was celebrated after his death much more than during his lifetime
4037628 they made sure he would accept it though because if he refused it will look very embarrassing to the regime
4037629 in the last two years he was sick and old also surrounded by people who didnt want any trouble with the government thats why he accepted the award
4037630 it wasnt his intention always to be against the regime during the nasserist period he produced films that supported the regime like fajr youm gedid the dawn of a new day
4037631 he wasnt an opponent he just interacted with society and history
4037632 the celebration will not add to chahines name it will only add to the states name it will make it more trusted
4037633 he was always optimistic his films are a celebration of life he is always for love the young beauty and the future
4037634 he never laments the past in his films he praises the present and promises a better future these are the films i want to see and hope to make
4037635 although not seriously injured he has been left understandably traumatised as a result of this unprovoked attack in his own neighbourhood
4037636 we know there were a number of people in the area at the time and are appealing for anyone who may have witnessed the incident to come forward
4037637 thats why we now find the reserve bank now finds itself in a position where its able to think about cutting interest rates
4037638 we were looking for a reduction in demand weve seen that happen
4037639 the household sector has responded favourably by cutting back on spending and increasing their savings
4037640 that has made it a lot easier for the reserve bank to respond on interest rates
4037641 in the very near term as we said in our statement inflation could rise further mr battellino said
4037642 thats not unusual because inflation lags the cycle in some ways
4037643 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late
4037644 my guess is that the banks are saying its unreasonable for them to give commitments when they dont know when the rba is going to move or by how much rba deputy governor ric battellino told a federal parliamentary committee hearing in sydney
4037645 made an important point yesterday when he said it was in cbas own interest to lower interest rates as much as possible for its customers
4037646 lets face facts theres four players most of us bank with the four players and they are all the same
4037647 its a cosy club as soon as one hikes rates up the rest follow thats a cosy club theres not really effective competition at all
4037648 its difficult to imagine a circumstance where the government could directly control interest rates without a whole range of adverse consequences occurring
4037649 but the banks will carry a very heavy onus to explain any variation from any reduction by the reserve bank in the rates as compared with what they actually do
4037650 despite its volatility the rba will take some comfort that the growth in this measure has moderated
4037651 that amp squo s why we now find the reserve bank now finds itself in a position where it amp squo s able to think about cutting interest rates

4037657 two more indian priests who had been working with fr prakash in eastern nepal on village development and education projects also received warnings on the phone
4037658 if a western priest comes under attack his government will take it up immediately
4037659 if a nepalese priest is attacked other nepalese and the media will raise a hue and cry but the indian government doesnt take up cudgels on behalf of its citizens in nepal and people feel they can be targeted with impunity
4037660 till parliament overwhelmingly declared nepal a secular state christians as non hindus had been under some threat from the hindu country
4037661 this crime was rampant and thats not to say it doesnt still exist
4037662 its organised crime presence is most apparent in the betting ring where the laundering of the proceeds of crime had been commonplace

4037671 we will be investing rs 5 000 crore in the first phase till december 2009 to reach 15 000 mw capacity besides the board has also approved an investment of similar amount to take the capacity to 20 000 mw by 2012
4037672 any change in the parameters requires a complete redesigning of the project and that causes delay sometimes

4037675 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4037676 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4037677 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4037678 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4037679 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4037680 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4037681 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4037682 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4037683 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

4037690 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4037691 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4037692 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4037693 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4037694 if she takes it all into her own hands well whats for me do

4037747 bei der sp wird an einer wiedereinf hrung der erbschafts und schenkungssteuer gebastelt ein falscher schritt denn eine r ckkehr zur erbschafts und schenkungssteuer bedeutet wieder eine mehrbelastung von rund 130 millionen euro f r jene menschen im land die verm gen oder eigentum von eltern oder verwandten vererbt bekommen

4037774 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4037775 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4037891 she suffers from extreme psychological pain and humiliation and emotional distress knowing that the tapes still exist that they have not been secure and that others have been permitted to view the videotapes
4037892 he managed to get in there and cherry pick what he wanted
4037893 move forward secure in the knowledge that the images of these events were behind her and had been destroyed
4037894 police officers employed by the city of tacoma could not simply take the pornographic images home for their viewing

4037896 danielles life in the state of washington is worth zero to 30 days i would have died for her

4037955 ive never done it either it can be our thing
4037956 its the preferred method in europe especially with the runway models dont you want to do runways in europe
4037957 make sure you use enough because if this is her first time shell be especially tight and it might hurt her use enough to really loosen her up and go slow until she gets used to it then its smooth sailing from there
4037958 oh my god bbbllllaaahhhh you filmed this you asshole bbbllllaaaahhhh how could you bbbllllaaaahhhh i thought you loved me bbbllllaaaahhhh i let you fuck me in the ass bbbllllaaaahhhh
4037959 my daughter is 11 and lives with here mom in rancho however i do have custody of her but she lives with her mother for the time being she has two step sisters and because of my work and school schedule living with her mopther is best right now she usually comes over on my off days and every other weekend depending on her school schedule
4037960 rebecca is staying home with her robin works outside the house and i work from home he goes to work in the morning i go downstairs to my office i go upstairs at lunchtime and help put her down for her nap we rotate bedtime routine and a little perk is we rotate dates our little girl gets one on one time with one of us while the other two are having a date which is something that a lot of new parents dont get to say
4037961 you need to realize that each pair relationship is not going to be the same and you cant try to make it the same
4037962 they attacked our areas in wadi atron with a massive force
4037963 they came with more than 200 vehicles and killed seven people
4037964 constant reassurance that he is a terrific guy handsome accomplished
4037965 you have women in new york saying that all of their lovers have been narcissistic
4037966 new york which promises so much is particularly attractive to narcissistic personalities
4037967 those of us who live here tend to be drawn to this kind of thing because its a little bit of a fantasy world narcissists tell us that theyre wonderful terrific talented people and we believe them because we want to believe them because we want to be part of that same dream
4037968 john edwards dream was he was going to be the president
4037969 what could be more engaging so its very easy for anyone to be attracted to narcissists and to get involved in these relationships the problem is its very easy to get clobbered
4037970 its really hard to be in a relationship with a narcissist
4037971 you have to have no sense of self whatsoever and usually thats what narcissists prey on people who will worship them the way they want to be worshiped
4037972 narcissists are just not good in relationships because when the relationship is all about them and their own needs and theyre not really interested in the other person its a one way relationship
4037973 if a guy is attending more to his own needs than to yours look out
4037974 narcissism is a bunch of character traits that involve self admiration self centeredness and self regard
4037975 if a guy youre dating is looking at a particular suit or shirt and he tries it on and says i like the way my eyes look in that thats okay
4037976 but if he talks only about the shirt and is caring only about how he looks in it and who hes going to attract in it then it becomes excessive when we define excessive we talk about whether its knocking out the possibility for him to extend himself into somebody elses life
4037977 i always loved to wear chunky jewelry but i had a hard time finding stuff that fit my style
4037978 i was under the impression that there were as many people in law schools as there are lawyers
4037979 a lot of what academics do is not value adding even within the university framework
4037980 the census data shows about 60 of working graduates are legal professionals
4037981 je me sens bien dans leau parce quil y a cette impression de flotter je ne dirai pas voler mais quand je regarde le fond je me dis que je ne touche pas le sol et que je peux quand m me avancer reculer
4037982 expliquer bernard sest pris au jeu et tout naturellement a disput ses premi res comp titions il ne r vait pas une carri re de grand champion il voulait tout simplement tre le meilleur
4037983 il est t tu il peut tre tr s p nible il peut vraiment senfermer dans des trucs terribles par contre il est capable de venir et dire je suis d sol mais pas tout de suite
4037984 javais limpression d tre dans un monde parall le j tais seul dans ma t te pour moi jallais gagner la course avant m me de partir
4037985 im just trying to get on base this has been a fun two games for us and were doing things and scoring and winning in different ways a lot of guys were great tonight and the last couple of nights its just a lot of fun when things come together and you win
4037986 hes got a lot more pop than ive given him credit for with lowell out hes the guy who can step up and really carry us hes been fun to watch
4037987 its just fun to come up to the plate and have people on base all the time i think this ballpark is really conducive to a righthanded hitter ive been here like 12 days and i feel as if ive been here all year its really felt comfortable for me
4037988 i just go up and try to get hits or a walk get on base
4037989 you cant worry about where you hit when you go up there its not like they put a number on you saying youre hitting fourth today you go up you have the same number on your back you have to have the same at bats
4037990 i thought he had power on his two seamer and his cutter we set out to win tonight and we did we made it more interesting than we needed to
4037991 hes becoming one of the premier lefthanders in the game
4037992 hes starting to be one of those guys the team can depend on every time he pitches now hes getting dominating hes reminding people of a younger andy pettitte every time he goes out there its great to watch young pitchers develop and blossom and this kid has done that before our very eyes after all hes been through with the cancer the red sox have a no 1 lefthanded starter theyre hard to find
4037993 also without power supply for the use of a system
4037994 bmw announced a voluntary recall regarding the front passenger airbag seat sensor mat involving approximately 200 000 model year 2004 06 vehicles
4037995 bmw has found that the sensor mat may become damaged during vehicle usage depending upon the manner and frequency of the front passengers entry and exit
4037996 in this situation bmw recommends customers not to use the front passenger seat and have the vehicle serviced immediately at the present time we are unaware of any accidents or injuries as a result of this issue
4037997 over the past decade south africa has established a well developed banking system which compares favourably with those in many developed countries and which sets south africa apart from many other emerging market countries at the end of 2004 we find ourselves with a more mature banking sector with a moderate level of private sector indebtedness and a respectable and first rate regulatory and legal framework south african banks are well managed and utilise sophisticated risk management systems and corporate governance structures in conducting the business of a bank
4037998 how long do we have to make a noise before they start listening to us
4037999 the entire conversation and the entire desires were initiated by mr barany
4038000 it was very transparent that it was a 13 year old girl and it was very transparent that he was engaging in this conversation to at some point engage in a lewd act with her
4038001 as a teacher he really is a trusted member of the community and he couldnt have done anything worse to break that trust
4038002 theyre constantly monitoring web sites dealing with financial fraud identity theft and sites that may engage in exploitation of children
4038003 we have to play better i know we played some pretty good teams but were going to have to beat the good teams if were going to be able to get to the playoffs
4038004 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us
4038005 early on i was able to establish first pitch strikes and i was around the zone with this team if you establish strikes early on you can get some easy outs later i was able to do that
4038006 i ran into a little trouble in the eighth but that happens
4038007 obviously you want to stay and you want to finish the game
4038008 but hes the manager im not going to argue with him as a competitor you dont want to be taken out of the game you want to finish the inning he thinks that i need to get out of the game and give our bullpen a chance to shut it down
4038009 i dont doubt he could have gotten out of it himself
4038010 i just thought it was the right thing for the rest of the season i think hes smart enough to know that but i didnt want to see him get those earned runs either
4038011 i thought he had power on his two seamer and his cutter its a shame you looked up at the end and the inherited runners score because i really thought he pitched really really well
4038012 against that lineup we score early and we added on when you do that a mistake doesnt beat you
4038013 he was outstanding particularly in his command of the bottom of the strike zone
4038014 seemingly over the last two nights any mistakes we made in the strike zone they didnt miss which was evident even in the eighth inning with kinsler against lester he did a great job of throwing the sinker down and away to righties and then to some lefties and more than anything he was able to throw three pitches for strikes but was relentless with his location in the bottom of the zone
4038015 i dont know what my top or my bottom is its just a matter of going out and being consistent and ive been able to do that for the past couple of months and thats the main thing you want to go out and pitch a quality start and hopefully we win that game
4038016 szekely nu e trecut pe lista uefa pentru dubla cu galata
4038017 the only thing they young players can give me is an olympic gold medal lets shock the world
4038018 hes throwing the ball pretty well hes 41 and has some kids so he will figure out what he wants to do with rheal he has a wealth of experience
4038019 that was a good time it ended up being more than i thought it was going to be as far as going back and competing there to get ready for these olympics
4038020 im glad i did it now the average age was probably 25 26 yeah i was the father
4038021 if the opportunity comes up it would be great if it doesnt its been good so i just want to concentrate on this and enjoy these olympics if its bound to happen it will and if not im totally content
4038022 hes a tremendous player and not having him in there is definitely something not good for our lineup but going to third base is natural to me ive always loved playing third its actually an easier position than first base and thats something a lot of people dont realize at third you dont quite have all the moving around as you do at first base first base is far more physical
4038023 the things that worry you with the oblique area you always hear the doctor say when it stops hurting then wait a week because it has a way of nagging
4038024 putting casey in we have a guy thats hitting 350 a professional hitter and the ability to move youk over to third is huge
4038025 its not like theres nowhere to play him we have the ability to let jed lowrie play third put alex cora at short and if we have to well probably do that anyway so there are some ways we can make this work were still comfortable that we can win with the guys that we have
4038026 obviously the hgh thing in the middle of the playoffs like that was a distraction
4038027 more disappointing than that was what we lost on the field
4038028 i felt as if i was in the witness protection program i was told not to say anything it was a grueling time
4038029 the alternative of that is taking the mound when games dont count and youre not in anything and thats not fun at all so i love the pressure
4038030 i wasnt a big red sox fan in the offseason
4038031 i was up 3 1 and had a chance to win the alcs so i had to work through some forgiveness issues there and it took about five minutes because i couldnt wait to get over here put on this jersey and have a chance to make the playoffs
4038032 his one rule is play as hard as you can
4038033 i hear hes a boots guy so i might have to get him a couple pairs of boots maybe a watch
4038034 i didnt know if the number was important to him or not but its been my number for a while so it was nice of him to give it up
4038035 i just told him i wanted another ring and to pitch well thats my present
4038036 fenway has a big center field and right field the green monster will knock some balls down
4038037 nothing to it speculation like this comes up every once in a while a few weeks ago i was rumored be going north to toronto this time to california the fact is i love boston new england and the red sox and i want to finish my baseball career here with my family and my partners and my colleagues
4038038 tristetea mea ca suporter este ca nu am reusit sa ii batem numai noi ne incurcam cand altii nu ne incurca galatasaray a fost haotica si fara nici un orizont nu m a impresionat deloc si consider ca turcii sunt victime sigure pentru retur steaua trebuia sa se califice din prima mansa si eu cand antrenam steaua in anii 90 am inceput calificarile in liga cu egaluri si acasa ne am calificat dar de ce sa nu te califici daca poti din tur
4038039 mie nu mi place nicolita fie ca da gol sau nu
4038040 dac oferea cineva nainte de meci acest 2 2 toat lumea l alegea cu ochii nchi i
4038041 there are many other measures equally important number of patients on waiting lists time to transplant the conversion rate from a number of donors identified to those who become successful donors
4038042 many consumers believe what they pay now is either a tax or a fee thats being paid to have their tire responsibly recycled in fact very little of that money goes to the tire being responsibly recycled the bulk of it is retained by the tire retailer
4038043 weve had to shut down shifts in our factories for lack of scrap tire material while tires are being driven down the qew in front of us on the way to buffalo to be burned as fuel
4038044 theyre better off harnessing whats going on today getting some clarity on what the consumer is paying and getting the manufacturers to build in some recycling incentives
4038045 its a particular aspect thats deemed not to be compliant or what we want them to be doing
4038046 the site was in compliance otherwise it would have been shut down
4038047 no one should speculate based on the results of the previous inspections as to what may or may not have caused the explosion
4038048 if we find out we need to improve our systems in the tssa or we need to improve our relationship with the tssa or we need to improve the way tssa works if that is necessary for the safety of our residents its our obligation to make sure that happens
4038049 what they can do right away in order to assure the residents that these facilities are safe
4038050 our governments obligation is to make sure ontario residents are safe so whatever it takes for us to do that were going to do that
4038051 its not part of the government so all of the accountability structures that go with being that have disappeared
4038052 theres a vacuum in terms of where the buck really stops
4038053 if you said to a child look were going to let you inspect whether youve made your own bed in the morning and no parents ever going to come and look whether youve made your bed or not human nature being the way it is people dont necessarily do what theyre supposed to do
4038054 the problem starts with the rules not with the enforcers weve got to review the rules and make sure those rules are tightened to take account of the realities of modern day urban ontario
4038055 the huge and dramatic and very dangerous explosion demonstrates what a failure the conservative liberal privatization agenda has been
4038056 the privatization of the regulation and inspection and policing simply doesnt work people die and suffer as a result
4038057 the mcguinty liberals were fiercely opposed to the tory privatization and the creation of the tssa
4038058 they howled in protest when they were in opposition its time to restore it to a government body
4038059 paul ince doing well doesnt mean other black men can be good managers if he doesnt do well it doesnt mean others will be bad managers
4038060 unfortunately that is the way it is going to look
4038061 give him five games without winning a match and the question marks will be whether he is up for the job
4038062 is he getting the respect of the players if that was the case alex ferguson would not be manager now
4038063 he needs support because they will go through a bad time at some stage all clubs go through dodgy spells its important he gets off to a good start because if he does theyll give him more time after a dodgy spell
4038064 once upon a time if the players didnt do well the players would be blamed and not mark hughes whereas now it could be that if blackburn dont do well paul ince could be blamed
4038065 subconsciously that could filter through to the players and im hoping that will not be the case because paul can be a very very good manager and has proved that already
4038066 paul ince is not there as an english black coach paul ince is there for himself to do well hes not there to be a trailblazer for everyone else to say i was there first it didnt work out for me but it helped others come through
4038067 while its achievement itself in the big scheme of things for paul himself his achievement is doing well
4038068 he could become the first black england manager so could anybody else whose given an opportunity hes got a premiership job now but in talking about an england manager maybe youre talking about five years down the line
4038069 now if les ferdinand gets a job next year and he does well he could become the first black england manager so you only talk about someone who is in the job now

4038097 we strongly support the local production of ethanol as a gasoline additive since it will drive capital investments in rural areas create more jobs and more importantly it will lessen the countrys dependence on imported fuel
4038098 the use of ethanol in gasoline will also have a positive impact on the environment since it is biodegradable and reduces harmful exhaust emissions
4038099 the early introduction of our e10 premium product ahead of the government mandate underscores our desire to bring the benefits of ethanol blended gasoline to our customers and stakeholders as soon as possible
4038100 jemma doesnt want to know her results until she gets back from the olympics
4038101 ive been told to go and pick up her results from school but not to open the envelope
4038102 jemma has done exceptionally well to balance the demands of her a level course and those of her olympic training regime
4038103 she has shown tremendous determination and we are very proud of her success both in the pool as well as the exam hall
4038104 i gave it my best shot and thats all i can do
4038105 my plan was to go out fast yesterday i went out easier and my coach said i should go out faster and i think im back to my normal self
4038106 as far as what coach wants to do with that thats his decision
4038107 im just really trying to go out there and get this offense down and if he feels comfortable with me thats great
4038108 but my first couple of years in the league i played a lot of football so thats come in handy and helped me be comfortable out there and confident right now im still trying to learn this offense and take that next step of making my reads faster and making good decisions

4038126 how and why did all of the previous ice ages melt
4038127 the science of global warming is clear we know enough to act now we must act now
4038128 our nation has both an obligation and self interest in facing head on the serious environmental economic and national security threat posed by global warming
4038129 these technologies will help us become better stewards of the environment and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change
4038130 why is the right wing so focused on attacking science
4038131 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4038132 we are going to have to work harder as an industry to get the next generation to be passionate about what we are passionate about
4038133 we can do it but it is going to take effort

4038137 n a fost deloc in dezavantajul lui putin cel groaznic dimpotriva a fost unul dintre scopurile incursiunii militare dincolo de granita
4038138 putin intelege mai bine ca oricine ca petrolul si gazele sunt sursa reafirmarii rusiei ca putere economica si militara precum si a controlului sau asupra guvernului rus si asupra unor sectoare cheie din economie petrolul si gazele aduc banii care permit mentinerea unei armate puternice ruse pe langa un vast intern de securitate si a unei retele de intreprinderi controlate de guvern care permit presedintelui transformat in premier sa detina controlul asupra puterii politice si economice
4038139 controlul asupra retelei de conducte care leaga fostele republici sovietice de occident i a permis rusiei sa preia o mare parte profiturile pe care aceste tari le obtineau din vanzarea de petrol si gaze dar odata cu aparitia btc sustinuta activ de guvernele eurpene si sua rusia urma sa si piarda controlul monopolist deschizand calea companiilor occidentale de a face investitii de miliarde de dolari in statele caucaziene bogate in resurse energetice
4038140 cu timpul majoritatea eforturilor lor s au concentrat pe un proiect in valoare de 12 miliarde de dolari cunoscut sub numele de nabucco care ar fi transportat gazul caspic via georgia turcia bulgaria romania si ungaria ajungand la un terminal energetic in apropiere de viena europa este deja dependenta energetic de rusia importand din aceasta tara o patrime din gazele naturale consumate dependenta ce ar urma sa creasca in viitor prin construirea unei conducte directe prin marea baltica ce va lega germania de rusia liderii europeni erau asadar nerabdatori sa gaseasca surse alternative pentru a importa gaze naturale mai ales dupa ce in iarna lui 2006 rusia a intrerupt livrarile de gaz dupa o disputa cu ucraina
4038141 putin in mod corect a privit nabucco ca facand parte dintr o mai ampla condusa de washington de a izola rusia si de a limita expansiunea imperiului sau energetic prin gazprom monopolul de stat rus putin a lansat propria sa contraoferta numita south stream meinta sa transporte gazul din caucaz brusc rusii au oferit turkmenistanului si azerbaidjanului un pret mult mai mare decat cel oferit pana atunci cu scopul de a asigura contracte pe termen lung de asemenea au obtinut un acord cu compania italiana eni pentru a construi conducta south stream n r prin marea neagra catre europa urmand sa ajunga la acelasi terminal austriac ca nabucco oficialii rusi au oferit conditii foarte favorabile tarilor tranzitate astfel incat au obtinut acordul bulgariei serbiei si ungariei
4038142 acum cu aceasta incursiune militara de succes rusia a ridicat dubii serioase in mintea investitorilor si creditorilor occidentali ca o noua conducta prin georgia ar fi in siguranta de atacuri si de controlul kremlinului
4038143 ni s a amintit din nou ca vladimir putin nu are nici o retinere in a sacrifica statul de drept si parerea buna a celorlati pentru a proteja imperiul rus si monopolul sau energetic tehnicile folosite pentru a ingenunchea georgia chiar daca mult mai letale si distructive sunt aceleasi cu cele utilizate de putin pentru a reduce la tacere opozitia si pentru a expropria companiile energetice yukos shell si bp
4038144 vladimir putin crede ca a privit in sufletul vestului si a descoperit ca avem nevoie mai mult de el decat are el de noi trebuie sa l convingem de contrariu
4038145 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react
4038146 she was really upset about everything that happened after the scandal last year people in india were burning effigies of her in the street
4038147 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone that shes not a racist
4038148 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
4038149 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
4038150 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
4038151 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
4038152 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
4038153 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
4038154 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
4038155 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
4038156 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
4038157 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
4038158 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
4038159 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
4038160 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
4038161 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4038162 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4038163 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4038164 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4038165 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4038166 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4038167 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4038168 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
4038169 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
4038170 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
4038171 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
4038172 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
4038173 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
4038174 who will be the next president of the united states
4038175 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
4038176 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
4038177 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
4038178 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
4038179 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4038180 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4038181 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4038182 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4038183 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4038184 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4038185 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4038186 tbilisi georgia it was a claim that could have provoked a dangerous kremlin response the united states is readying to take over airports and ports in the former soviet republic of georgia the claim by u s backed georgia president mikhail saakashvili on wednesday was swiftly shot down by officials in washington who denied any such designs on georgian soil yet it was the latest in a string of overstated pronouncements by the american educated georgian leader that are further fueling tensions with moscow
4038187 georgian officials said the russians had looted and bombed gori before they left moscow denied the accusation but it appeared to be on a technicality a bbc reporter in gori said russian tanks were in the streets while their south ossetian allies seized cars looted homes and set houses on fire
4038188 heres a deal if by aug 17th georgia is not part of nato defacto or otherwise you will post a humble apology to me in your profile
4038189 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4038190 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4038191 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
4038192 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
4038193 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
4038194 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
4038195 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
4038196 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
4038197 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
4038198 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
4038199 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
4038200 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
4038201 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
4038202 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4038203 many of us are motivated by a deep disgust with and distrust of the dnc leadership
4038204 there will be no unity in the democratic party until the voices of the 18 million voters who support hillary clinton are heard and heeded until the voices of pumas are once again listened to by the leadership of the democratic party we will be guided by that defiance we will not be bullied brainwashed or bossed into falling in line
4038205 i woke up that morning and said holy smoke theyre not even gonna let her run and compete the obama campaign is gonna sit back and take the benefits of that crap from msnbcs mike barnicle and chris matthews and tucker carlson and maureen dowd and howard dean thats what did it for me
4038206 our goal is to get the dnc to follow the process and let the delegates vote for her nomination
4038207 theres a big difference between a hope and a goal
4038208 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4038209 21 positions are being eliminated in the austin office of ncsoft in the area of product development primarily this is related to products which we have not previously announced and were in prototype phases
4038210 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4038211 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4038212 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4038213 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4038214 this is a truly great leader a truly great man a truly inspiring man
4038215 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4038216 russias ambassador to nato declared that georgian president mr saakashvili
4038217 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
4038218 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
4038219 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
4038220 if im not mistaken i think that they already indicated the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention i understand that
4038221 john edwards was a great champion of working people during the course of his campaign many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention and i wish them all well
4038222 yeah bomb the mess out of them take em over

4038237 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would

4038241 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over
4038242 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4038243 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4038244 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4038245 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
4038246 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4038247 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4038248 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4038249 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4038250 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4038251 just so you all know we did set a record
4038252 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4038253 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4038254 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4038255 the people of connecticut deserve to have the chance and the choice to vote for ralph nader should that be the candidate of their choice
4038256 he did not help in 2000 and hes not going to this year i guess hes a closet republican he helps elect republicans
4038257 theoretically its always possible for someone to get one vote that could make a difference
4038258 it could go down a little or it could go up a little
4038259 if hes got the support and hes qualified good luck to him
4038260 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
4038261 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
4038262 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4038263 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4038264 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4038265 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4038266 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4038267 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4038268 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4038269 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4038270 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
4038271 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
4038272 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
4038273 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4038274 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4038275 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the global warming
4038276 the purpose of the meeting today is to discuss the conflict between russ and corey and determine what is going to change to get the project back on track
4038277 i am going to ask some questions when you respond you may only speak for yourself
4038278 joe do you ever observe conflicting directions from russ and corey
4038279 speak only for yourself joe what impact does it have on your work when you observe these conflicts
4038280 i get started on one thing and i have to stop i supervise a crew of drivers who move the heavy stuff in place when i have them start and stop i immediately know there is a problem with the leadership
4038281 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4038282 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4038283 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4038284 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4038285 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4038286 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4038287 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4038288 well what right do you have to speak about them then
4038289 hes ready to take his fight down into the mud
4038290 asks a valid question of whether the relatively inexperienced obama is ready to lead
4038291 oh ya i almost forgot to explain to carolyn and the others out there about
4038292 carolyn al is correct but it goes one step further mr weaver never intended to try and use the vi money for flood releif he wants to put a halt to anything to do with vision iowa and use the 5 8 million dollars that would have been the citys responsability and use it for flood releif
4038293 jb i forgot to mention that the speed limit on all trucks should be reduced to 45m
4038294 carolyn where to you get the idea that max wanted to use vi funds to aid flood victims
4038295 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4038296 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4038297 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4038298 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4038299 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4038300 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4038301 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4038302 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4038303 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4038304 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4038305 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4038306 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4038307 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4038308 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4038309 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4038310 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4038311 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4038312 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4038313 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4038314 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4038315 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4038316 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4038317 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4038318 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
4038319 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4038320 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4038321 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4038322 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4038323 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4038324 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4038325 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4038326 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4038327 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4038328 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4038329 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4038330 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4038331 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4038332 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4038333 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4038334 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4038335 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
4038336 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
4038337 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
4038338 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
4038339 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
4038340 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
4038341 this was a slowly developing condition which due to constant use of the voice caused inflammation of the throat and impairment of speech it was a condition shared with schoolteachers and street hawkers
4038342 when i began the practice of masturbation at the age of 16 i was in the habit of exercising my voice regularly
4038343 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
4038344 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
4038345 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
4038346 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
4038347 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
4038348 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
4038349 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
4038350 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
4038351 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4038352 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4038353 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4038354 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4038355 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4038356 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4038357 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4038358 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4038359 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4038360 sie behaupten das habe technische gr nde sie wollten das nutzungserlebnis auf dem iphone nicht von au enseitern durcheinanderbringen lassen
4038361 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
4038362 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4038363 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4038364 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4038365 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4038366 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4038367 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4038368 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
4038369 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
4038370 real results by the end of my first term in office
4038371 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
4038372 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
4038373 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4038374 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4038375 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4038376 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4038377 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4038378 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4038379 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4038380 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4038381 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4038382 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4038383 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4038384 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4038385 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4038386 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4038387 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4038388 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4038389 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4038390 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4038391 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4038392 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4038393 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4038394 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4038395 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4038396 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4038397 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4038398 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4038399 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4038400 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4038401 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4038402 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4038403 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4038404 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4038405 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4038406 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4038407 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4038408 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4038409 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4038410 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
4038411 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
4038412 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
4038413 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
4038414 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
4038415 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
4038416 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
4038417 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
4038418 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
4038419 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
4038420 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
4038421 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
4038422 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
4038423 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
4038424 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
4038425 going negative against democrat barack obama isnt just a campaign strategy for republican john mccain
4038426 top the aug 17 new york times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list
4038427 lashes out at barack obama and alleges among other things that the politician has a secret radical islamic agenda
4038428 whether they like him or oppose him readers want to hear more about barack obama
4038429 the author of the million selling dreams from my father and the audacity of hope
4038430 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4038431 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4038432 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4038433 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4038434 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4038435 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4038436 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4038437 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4038438 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4038439 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4038440 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4038441 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4038442 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4038443 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4038444 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4038445 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
4038446 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4038447 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4038448 the world of online sharing of information and the way that our customers are coming together more and more really makes it a challenge to keep content fresh
4038449 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
4038450 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
4038451 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
4038452 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
4038453 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
4038454 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
4038455 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
4038456 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
4038457 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
4038458 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4038459 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4038460 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4038461 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4038462 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4038463 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4038464 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4038465 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4038466 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4038467 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4038468 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4038469 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4038470 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4038471 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4038472 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4038473 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4038474 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4038475 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4038476 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4038477 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4038478 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4038479 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4038480 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4038481 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4038482 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4038483 my guess is for the near future that one wing of the building will probably be unusable
4038484 creating a permanent unit on this work says the city cares
4038485 these are the kids we might end up dealing with on the streets five or six years from now
4038486 it gives us a lot of positive feeling of hope
4038487 helps kids see us as having life experiences like theirs
4038488 thats when they break down their walls and learn to share things
4038489 they can open up they can reach their goals and dreams
4038490 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4038491 we are fed lie after lie to mask the destruction the corporate state has wrought in our lives the consumer price index for example used by the government to measure inflation has become meaningless
4038492 statement for the record to the u s house of representatives committee on the judiciary subcommittee on the constitution civil rights and civil liberties
4038493 over the years we have seen the state secrets privilege mutate from a common law evidentiary rule that permits the government
4038494 in each of these instances the government has sought dismissal at the pleading stage and the privilege as asserted by the government and as construed by the courts has often permitted dismissal of these suits on the basis of a government affidavit alone these qualitative and quantitative shifts in the governments use and the courts acceptance of the state secrets privilege warrant legislative action to correct this imbalance of power and rein in unconstitutional executive practices that are injurious to the health of a democratic society
4038495 to this day the american people do not know the full extent of the telecom actions in warrantless wiretapping and if amnesty passes we may never know allowing this administration and these corporations to get away with this illegal and unconstitutional behavior sets the worst type of precedent for future american generations
4038496 hundreds of police firefighters paramedics and even utility workers have been trained and recently dispatched as
4038497 the justice department is considering letting the fbi investigate americans without any evidence of wrongdoing relying instead on a terrorist profile that could single out muslims arabs or other racial and ethnic groups
4038498 critics say the presumption of innocence is lost in the proposal
4038499 by assuming that everyones a suspect and then you weed out the innocent
4038500 if he was treated that way because of his ethnicity that will make me madder than heck
4038501 immediately after 9 11 hundreds of muslims and arabs were detained deported and monitored as the government urgently sought information that could prevent another attack despite efforts to repair and nurture relationships with those groups muslim and arab americans still complain of being singled out by federal security practices
4038502 hope st augustine wrote has two beautiful daughters they are anger and courage anger at the way things are and the courage to see they do not remain the way they are we stand at the verge of a massive economic dislocation one forcing millions of families from their homes and into severe financial distress one that threatens to rend the fabric of our society we are waging a war that devours lives and capital and that cannot ultimately be won we are told we need to give up our rights to be safe to be protected in short we are made afraid we are told to hand over all that is best about our nation to those like george bush and dick cheney who seek to destroy our nation a state of fear only engenders cruelty cruelty fear insanity and then paralysis in the center of dantes circle the damned remained motionless if we do not become angry if we do not muster within us the courage indeed the militancy to challenge those in the democratic and republican parties who herd us toward the corporate state we will have squandered our courage and our integrity when we need it most

4038549 its been such a great mood created by the new huts even just at the design stage
4038550 the beach hut is such a part of the seaside here such a trademark

4038603 the angels usually find a way to win and thats what we need to do not just be satisfied to play with teams of that caliber
4038604 thats what rigglemans been stressing to us every game that were capable of being a really good team
4038605 the year to me is in reference to what year is it in terms of the injuries one year its knees one year its ankles one year its hamstrings and right now we seem to have the hamstring year for us so it seems we have a few more of those than anything else but i dont think its any more overall injuries this year
4038606 but im not overly concerned about being healthy for the opener at oregon on aug 30 right now these things happen and the first thing in football is the next guy has got to be prepared to step up but i think well be ok come game time

4038627 overall 31 of physicians were fully engaged or engaged while the largest proportion of physicians 53 were on the fence
4038628 sales representatives must develop personal relationships with their physicians to achieve the highest levels of engagement
4038629 in fact emotional components such as friendship with the reps are the strongest indicators of fully engaged physicians we find that this emotional dimension is key in understanding physicians perceptions toward their reps and the pharmaceutical company as a whole

4038636 what stands out is the mediocrity of a group of technicians and developers who are well meaning but full of an anachronistic paternalism in the best of cases and are once more using gaud to leave their personal mark on the building to the detriment of the original work
4038637 what they are constructing has little to do with the spirit of gaud it has more to do with building a tourist attraction and for propaganda purposes
4038638 this was a disaster because even though they had all the necessary documents regarding the material and techniques to be used they were not followed
4038639 the problem with restoring gaud s work is that by the time there was an awareness of his legacy he had been dead for 50 years

4038818 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4038819 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4038820 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4038821 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4038822 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4038823 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4038824 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4038831 kaum proletariat memerlukan negara hanya untuk sementara kita tidaklah sama sekali berbeda pendapat dengan kaum anarkis mengenai pembasmian negara sebagai tujuan kita tetap mempertahankan bahwa untuk mencapai tujuan tersebut kita harus sementara menggunakan instrumen sumber daya dan metode kekuasaan negara untuk melawan kaum pemeras

4038833 aspirasi proletariat tidak boleh mempunyai tujuan yang lain selain pembentukan organisasi ekonomi yang benar benar bebas dan federasi berdasarkan kerja dan persamaan dan sama sekali independen dari pemerintahan politik dan organisasi macam ini hanya dapat terbentuk dari aksi spontan kaum proletariat itu sendiri organisasi politik hanya bisa menjadi organisasi kekuasaan untuk kepentingan sebuah kelas dan merugikan massa proletariat bila mereka merebut kekuasaan akan menjadi kelas penguasa dan penindas
4038834 penyangkalan terhadap penaklukan kekuasaan sama saja dengan meninggalkan secara sukarela kekuasaan tersebut kepada orang orang yang memegangnya yaitu kaum penindas intisari dari setiap revolusi adalah menempatkan kelas yang baru ke dalam kekuasaan maka memungkinkan kelas tersebut untuk mewujudkan program kehidupannya sendiri tidaklah mungkin melakukan perperangan dan menolak kemenangan tidaklah mungkin memimpin massa menuju pemberontakan tanpa menyiapkan penaklukan kekuasaan
4038835 menolak semua aksi politik yang menurut mereka tidak mempunyai objektif segera dan langsung untuk kemenangan buruh terhadap kapitalisme dan sebagai akibatnya pembasmian negara
4038836 kita tidak memprotes di bawah bayang bayang parlemen yang tidak relevan kita sedang menanam benih sebuah masyarakat dimana rakyat biasa mempunyai kontrol atas tanah mereka sumber daya alam mereka makanan mereka dan proses pembuatan keputusan mereka taman ini merupakan simbol sebuah dorongan hati untuk menjadi independen daripada menjadi tergantung pada kapitalisme

4038854 for our two little congregations it has been a lot of fun to have more people to socialize with
4038855 its a very murky underground that most people dont know exists

4038864 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4038865 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4038866 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4038867 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4038868 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4038869 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4038870 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4038871 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4038872 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4038873 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4038874 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4038875 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4038876 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4038877 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4038878 its a fine line between doing enough bowling to keep your rhythm and making sure you get enough rest
4038879 but steve has been a professional cricketer for ten years and i get the impression he knows exactly what he needs to do to keep himself right
4038880 he needs to be consistent with his preparations and continue to do what he has done this season if he bowls like he did in the test last week then hes up there among the best in the world
4038881 i spoke to him about playing in one day internationals but he seems happy with his decision it would have been a tough decision for him and i know all about those
4038882 it was tough for me to decide to retire after such a good season last year and this club were really good to me but you have to live with your decisions and things have gone really well for me
4038883 i know from my own experience that if you take a complete break even for just a week you can lose rhythm and feel like you are starting from scratch
4038884 it was great to see him back in the england team after his disappointment in new zealand
4038885 i wont be able to go to south africa with him this year but if thats what he feels he needs to do he should do it because its a long time until the next test
4038886 he needs to turn up in india fit and strong and bowling like he did last week which was fantastic if everyone is fit the selectors will have some tough choices but thats what they are there for
4038887 simon jones is also bowling well again matthew hoggard isnt forgotten and there are lads like liam plunkett graham onions kabir ali and sajid mahmood knocking on the door
4038888 graham has had a bit of setback with his injury this season you work all pre season on your fitness and strength and you start out with good rhythm but that is easily lost through injury then self doubt creeps in
4038889 he has to build himself back up again he shouldnt start thinking he has become a bad bowler he has to keep his confidence levels up because things can soon turn around
4038890 liam can also lack a bit of confidence but overall hes the real deal he has the potential to be a world class allrounder
4038891 he feels he needs to bowl more overs to get back to his best but ive seen him a few times recently and his oneday form looks good
4038892 england will come again for him but he has to be ready mentally when the call comes
4038893 liam and kabir ali and sajid mahmood all had a taste of international cricket when they were very young perhaps it was too soon but if they go away and mature they will be better for it when they return
4038894 jimmy anderson has done really well this year and ryan sidebottom is the prime example
4038895 do not go gentle into that good night blog blog against the dying of the light
4038896 give me your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free
4038897 they are not going to send you back to the facility again brother you are free now
4038898 to jest wyj cie naprzeciw postulatom premiera donalda tuska zg oszonym miesi c temu czy wystarczaj co daleko to b dzie kwesti rozm w
4038899 m wimy o kilku umowach wi c jest jeszcze sporo do wynegocjowania
4038900 i knew he was on my side of the draw and it doesnt get any tougher than having to play the olympic champion but im as good as anyone
4038901 i dont care who i face next now because they all know what im capable of doing
4038902 its big to beat one of the greats but anyone in the worlds top 32 can beat each other because the sport is that close
4038903 im in the top 16 and i qualified as 21st so everything is a bonus from now i dont feel any pressure but marco told me that i better go on and win the gold
4038904 i was pretty nervious for the first round match because no one want to lose at that stage my routine was a bit out and i clearly wasnt at my best
4038905 its a fine line between shooting tens and eights and when you are under pressure you sometimes cross that line
4038906 against marco i was a lot more composed and in control of what i was doing when im shooting against an archer of a higher standard i always raise my game
4038907 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4038908 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4038909 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4038910 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4038911 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4038912 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4038913 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4038914 the ball came out nicely and i was pleased with the way i bowled its a good ground for me it always take turn here and i got five wickets last year
4038915 its a nice wicket to bowl spin on i thought that i was a bit unlucky early on and i had a catch dropped its nice to get a few wickets and im in good form at the moment
4038916 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4038917 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4038918 i was really happy to be part of this team with these girls and i just wanted to give it my all and try and win for australia

4038923 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log
4038924 highly readable and in part quite entertaining the website is certainly worth a visit
4038925 a double espresso of dull this is a man who has almost cornered the market in pedestrian prose and who unwittingly mimics the what i had for breakfast blog so beloved of the mainstream media
4038926 i feel like god is saying that he is going to take you to the next level like hes going to bring you to a deeper place with him but it is not like youre just going up the stairs its like i see you in this elevator that is going fast and high up several levels like you are going to get much closer to him then you have been
4038927 i feel like god is going to take you to the next level its like you are reaching the end of a video game level but instead of just going up to the next level youve found the warp zone and you are going up very high closer to god in your relationship and your ministry is going to the next level too
4038928 ok god can you just tell me how much this is going to hurt so i can prepare myself
4038929 the word is this you passed the test it was like god was saying that the test was a test of faithfulness and you passed the test and the faithfulness that you showed would now be sewn into the next season you your life
4038930 aus meiner sicht habe ich erreicht was ich in meinem leben erreichen wollte
4038931 our mum really encouraged us from as early as year six and prepared us from a young age to take control of our own learning
4038932 weve realised that aiming for the highest is really going to help us at first we were probably pushed on but now we see it as the best way to help ourselves
4038933 when the results come there will be some sibling rivalry im not going to lie
4038934 we all know weve tried our best especially going through the exam process together weve all been helping each other
4038935 its more like holding each others hand and being there
4038936 weve always shared the same friends especially me and my brother so when hes not there ill miss him in a way
4038937 our mum being a single mum has always taught us to be independent and lay our own foundations so even though going to uni is a massive step and a strange city its welcome its a welcome experience
4038938 like if your sisters in pain can you feel it and if were telepathic
4038939 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it
4038940 no one in the radiohead organisation is aware of the band composing any original incidental or ambient music for choke
4038941 my mindset was always that jonny was going to go back to united
4038942 he is totally different to anelka hes more of a link up man but has scored a lot of goals in france
4038943 hes not come in to replace anelka he has come to benefit the team i think we will get a lot of benefit from him and i think he will score quite a few goals for us
4038944 he is good in the air and i think he has a good eye for goal in and out of the box
4038945 it was good to finally get 90 minutes under my belt in a celtic shirt and i know im getting to where i want to be fitness wise
4038946 i found it tough going at times but i see it as another landmark in my career at this club
4038947 its been great getting to know all the boys and with every game im becoming more familiar with them and taking another step forward
4038948 it was a massive thrill getting on against manchester city last week but playing my first 90 minutes for months is an even more significant step
4038949 i need competitive first team games under my belt before i even think about internationals and thats what im working on at the moment
4038950 ill know exactly when im ready and so will the manager gordon strachan
4038951 im certain hell be impressed with me when i get myself up to 100 percent fitness and im working flat out to get there
4038952 after the relay i was physically and emotionally drained so to get in and do another 53 point this morning was great
4038953 i have got a night off now so i can get focused and ready for tomorrow morning
4038954 i have been told if you can do something three times you can improve and i have swum three times in the high 53s so improving on that would be nice tomorrow morning
4038955 i dont know what its going to take to win it but if my time is good enough i will be more than happy
4038956 my goal was to make it through each round and get through to the final ive done that now so i can re evaluate my goals and hopefully do what i want to do tomorrow
4038957 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4038958 that was never my goal i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4038959 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4038960 i didnt panic when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it
4038961 its so exciting its me and brontes last swim and what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
4038962 for us to break the record by so far is amazing
4038963 we went in knowing we had a really good chance i wasnt as nervous this time i was trying to enjoy the moment ive never led off a relay before
4038964 i feel amazing i finished such a great meet as part of the relay its amazing there wasnt a lot of nerves just a lot of excitement im so impressed with everything that happened
4038965 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4038966 the era of repression is over for ever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4038967 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it
4038968 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
4038969 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
4038970 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
4038971 reserve days will be used to try to complete the scheduled races in the opening series
4038972 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
4038973 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4038974 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
4038975 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
4038976 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes

4038978 ik reageer even op uw bericht over de zgn relmuizen of eikelmuizen vorige week heeft mijn pa in zijn tuin een beestje gezien dat heel goed op de foto leek hij zag het slechts van de achterzijde het deed hem denken aan een eekhoorn maar de staart was plat het was misschien 20 cm lang heel ruwgeschat en eerder slank het kwam van tussen de rode klaver onder de appelbomen en liep

4038979 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4038980 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4038981 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4038982 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4038983 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4038984 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4038985 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4038986 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4038987 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4038988 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4038989 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4038990 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4038991 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4038992 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4038993 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4038994 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4038995 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4038996 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4038997 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4038998 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4038999 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4039000 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4039001 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4039002 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4039003 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4039004 who are open to doing something on the production side
4039005 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4039006 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4039007 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4039008 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4039009 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4039010 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4039011 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4039012 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4039013 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4039014 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4039015 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4039016 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4039017 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4039018 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4039019 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4039020 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4039021 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4039022 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4039023 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4039024 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4039025 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4039026 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4039027 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4039028 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4039029 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4039030 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4039031 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4039032 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4039033 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4039034 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4039035 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4039036 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4039037 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4039038 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4039039 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

4039046 i felt that the honesty of the driver should have counted for something it also given his record makes a mockery of saying that the discipline system is meant to improve performance it is being used as a stick with which to beat our members
4039047 trading for all seasons on sale especially in the uk continues to be buoyant despite the challenging economic conditions our trading metrics are showing no evidence that consumers are trading down or curtailing their holiday plans

4039062 after the president has said that as commander in chief he is ultimately responsible for contractors on the battlefield it is disappointing that his administration has been unwilling to make that interest clear before the courts
4039063 the apparent lack of interest from the united states fortifies our conclusion that the case does not yet present a political question
4039064 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
4039065 100 billion is a very large amount of money in fact iraqs gdp was just over 100 billion in 2007 but what staggers my imagination is how sober adults would be willing to divert such vast sums of americas financial resources to the bank accounts of private firms whose dealings are opaque to taxpayers and for the most part held unaccountable
4039066 i think advocates of unaccountable privatization are beginning to reap what they have sown defending privatization of war making on such an enormous scale is becoming tenuous its hard to paint a picture of contractors providing taxpayers value when so many instances contractor misconduct have found their way into the publics consciousness
4039067 this magnitude of expenditures on private contractors is especially striking in light of recent government and media reports of dysfunction in the defense contract audit agency dcaa the protection of the interests of american taxpayers is apparently suffering a number of impediments
4039068 it happened with naguib mahfouz too egyptian nobel prize winner he was celebrated after his death much more than during his lifetime
4039069 they made sure he would accept it though because if he refused it will look very embarrassing to the regime
4039070 in the last two years he was sick and old also surrounded by people who didnt want any trouble with the government thats why he accepted the award
4039071 it wasnt his intention always to be against the regime during the nasserist period he produced films that supported the regime like fajr youm gedid the dawn of a new day
4039072 he wasnt an opponent he just interacted with society and history
4039073 the celebration will not add to chahines name it will only add to the states name it will make it more trusted
4039074 he was always optimistic his films are a celebration of life he is always for love the young beauty and the future
4039075 he never laments the past in his films he praises the present and promises a better future these are the films i want to see and hope to make

4039216 you hate me you do not really love me you have asked a riddle of my people but you have not explained it to me

4039220 the patriarchs jealous of joseph sold him into egypt but god was with him and rescued him from all his afflictions and enabled him to win favor and to show wisdom when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt who appointed him ruler over egypt and over all his household now there came a famine throughout egypt and canaan and great suffering and our ancestors could find no food but when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent our ancestors there on their first visit on the second visit joseph made himself known to his brothers and josephs family became known to pharaoh then joseph sent and invited his father jacob and all his relatives to come to him seventy five in all so jacob went down to egypt he himself died there as well as our ancestors and their bodies were brought back to shechem and laid in the tomb that abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of hamor in shechem

4039235 based on studies people are spending 30 percent of their time on digital but only about 10 percent of advertising spend is devoted to this emerging medium
4039236 its not so much about telling them whats going on technology wise but making them know how they can use it to increase brand awareness
4039237 based on market projections there will be more than 21 5 million here in the next few years 80 percent of them in metro manila alone
4039238 with digital you need to be in a perpetual state of beta
4039239 its about getting out a great idea rather than perfecting one first before starting a campaign
4039240 theres not a whole lot of options left for these guys
4039241 there are clearly political considerations here the law doesnt offer protection to these guys it will take a discretionary political decision to save them
4039242 every solider who has refused to fight in iraq hasnt contributed to killing innocent people
4039243 its a terrible thing that the government of canada doesnt listen to the parliament of canada or the many people who support war resisters in canada
4039244 this sends a chilling message to those going through the same process
4039245 its creating a wave of stress among everybody if jeremy hinzman who has a wife and kids can be kicked out what about the single guys who have been here for a shorter period of time
4039246 if we really want to compete with the rest of the world then we really need to take a look at ensuring our athletes and coaches have everything they need
4039247 what our current results are telling me is certainly we have a long way to go but im also seeing some positive signs as well
4039248 we realistically dont do well in the first half of the games
4039249 going back as far as montreal 1976 its the fourth or fifth day and as late as the seventh before we get our first medal
4039250 thats why we keep pushing for more investment in sports and why torontos 2015 pan american bid is so important
4039251 i dont believe that a full time high performance athlete in canada has the ability to get enough funding to support themselves on a year round training cycle without having to look elsewhere whether its a part time job or sponsorship of some sort
4039252 theres no question when the proposals went forward we knew full well that adjustments a year to 18 months prior to the games would not have a huge impact
4039253 unfortunately thats the cost of doing business in a high performance sport these days
4039254 all we do is train that means as an athlete if we want to compete on the world stage we cant be working
4039255 catherine is asking me why you are groping me since im not a 10 year old boy and heather says you should leave the god talk for when we climax together
4039256 whilst there are problems with reforming eu and international institutions in this wider picture and the existing precedent that europeans have set for abusing sovereignty cameron was generally right there are no excuses for leaving the situation unchecked
4039257 if a countless number of copies of the one and twenty letters of the alphabet made of gold or whatever you will were thrown together into some receptical and then shaken out on to the ground would it be possible that they should produce the annals of ennius i doubt whether chance could possibly succeed in the producing even a single verse

4039270 i denied myself nothing my eyes desired i refused my heart no pleasure my heart took delight in all my work and this was the reward for all my labour yet when i surveyed all that my hands had done and what i had toiled to achieve everything was meaningless a chasing after the wind nothing was gained under the sun
4039271 j ordway has been on the position of ambassador of the usa in kazakhstan for four years during which the volumes of trade investment cooperation between our countries increased significantly bilateral ties were reinforced i many spheres

4039273 i was not thinking about winning two gold medals at two consecutive olympics
4039274 that was never my goal i was just focused on doing my best in beijing
4039275 i cant believe it i know i was feeling down after the relay but i didnt want to get beaten
4039276 i didnt panic when i looked at the board i thought wow i did it
4039277 its so exciting its me and brontes last swim and what a great way to finish with a gold medal and a world record
4039278 for us to break the record by so far is amazing
4039279 we went in knowing we had a really good chance i wasnt as nervous this time i was trying to enjoy the moment ive never led off a relay before
4039280 i feel amazing i finished such a great meet as part of the relay its amazing there wasnt a lot of nerves just a lot of excitement im so impressed with everything that happened
4039281 he is totally different to anelka hes more of a link up man but has scored a lot of goals in france
4039282 hes not come in to replace anelka he has come to benefit the team i think we will get a lot of benefit from him and i think he will score quite a few goals for us
4039283 he is good in the air and i think he has a good eye for goal in and out of the box
4039284 it was good to finally get 90 minutes under my belt in a celtic shirt and i know im getting to where i want to be fitness wise
4039285 i found it tough going at times but i see it as another landmark in my career at this club
4039286 its been great getting to know all the boys and with every game im becoming more familiar with them and taking another step forward
4039287 it was a massive thrill getting on against manchester city last week but playing my first 90 minutes for months is an even more significant step
4039288 i need competitive first team games under my belt before i even think about internationals and thats what im working on at the moment
4039289 ill know exactly when im ready and so will the manager gordon strachan

4039306 they have been talking about it for four decades but that never seems to be enough
4039307 the government was quick to move for things like id cards or 42 day detention without trial now it needs to show similar leadership in public health
4039308 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
4039309 lots of the initiatives are under a voluntary agreement but it has just come to the point where things like these are simply not working
4039310 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
4039311 many of these 60 000 monuments need immediate attention otherwise they will be ruined
4039312 i felt tired before the competition but after it i feel relaxed
4039313 i thought a month ago if i would get this medal i would be every emotional
4039314 we have been working hard for eight years for this medal
4039315 but he handled it like a champion and i respect him very much
4039316 i never look at the scoreboard and think thats it
4039317 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4039318 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4039319 after so many years of competition especially in the all around there is no pressure from the outside anymore
4039320 you can think about the what if what if what if
4039321 several russian sites specialise in selling software that would be cyber criminals can download
4039322 where extortion or fraud is involved you can follow the money trail
4039323 websites run by chechen militants are hosted in western european countries with relatively large secure networks capable of handling larger volumes and less easily taken off air

4039330 i think we fell into that trap in the last month and it has cost us worrying about opposition teams results
4039331 weve gotten away from our own focus of winning games of football and started looking behind our back a bit
4039332 we looked ahead too and we cant do that any more because theres no bigger game than geelong
4039333 if you start looking ahead against a team like geelong youve got a problem
4039334 last time we played them we stuck with them for three quarters and then gary ablett blew us away in the last quarter
4039335 it does give you confidence to know you can go with them
4039336 last week fremantle was a game where we just wanted to get the win and get our confidence up to give us that momentum going into this week so we could play like we did against geelong earlier in the season

4039422 the threat that the u s and israel face from the islamic republic of iran is today greater than ever
4039423 we israel are benefiting from one thing and that is the attack on the twin towers and the pentagon and the american struggle in iraq
4039424 the duty of americans to support an island of democracy in the middle east
4039425 threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom
4039426 the rabbis say in the talmud that a lot of rabbinic law is to put a fence around the torah so you dont get near to violating it well mccain has a series of very clear headed policies toward terrorism and islamic extremism that put extra layers behind his support for israel
4039427 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link

4039448 there is some question about that report to the deq
4039449 weve got copies of an e mail that our supervisor mike andrews sent to the deq to file the report but found out later that their system was down if they didnt receive it we didnt know it
4039450 we attempted to file a report within 24 hours of the spill
4039451 our intent is to sit down with the deq and go over all this stuff there was a blip in the system somewhere along the way maybe in multiple spots
4039452 its not as simple as there was so much rain that it all carried to the river thats a generalized statement that im not sure we have the answer to
4039453 i think were going to find based on what ive heard that the spill was more than 500 gallons how much more i have no idea that seems to be all over the board
4039454 we have a sanitary sewer overflow control strategy and we expect municipal sanitary sewer systems to handle a 25 year rain event without overflowing and that equates to about four inches over 24 hours
4039455 because its untreated sewage its a public health risk because of pathogens like e coli and hepatitis a theres bad stuff in raw sewage

4039470 i think if we had more fans and more people here we would play better
4039471 me personally i like having a whole stadium of fans even if theyre all against me on the road because thats how baseball is supposed to be played when we went away and had a huge stadium of fans i think we did better than when we were here and it was a dead atmosphere
4039472 there are still people that who dont know where we are and what we do theres still some apathy here and we just have to fight through that the bombers will be back for year three and we hope to be here for a long time

4039494 this case is one of the most disturbing cases of animal cruelty we have heard in this court room we believe the four offences are so serious that only a prison sentence can be imposed
4039495 this was a truly tragic case where two young animals suffered immensely for a long period of time yet the suffering was entirely preventable
4039496 i would urge anyone in a similar situation struggling to cope with an animal to seek help before things get completely out of hand as they did in this case no one should ever be embarrassed about asking for help it is the right thing to do
4039497 there are numerous animal welfare charities that are on hand to give advice and support sitting back and allowing animals to suffer is simply not an option
4039498 similarly i would urge anyone who has suspicions of animals suffering silently in their area to please contact the rspca if we had received a call earlier it is possible we could have prevented the death of these dogs

4039541 weve had very volatile moves so im sure that theres a fair amount of investor caution out there
4039542 that will set the tone for the next 24 hours
4039543 certainly if euro zone gdp surprises on the downside and there is any sign of cpi inflation peaking then that would give the us dollar fresh impetus and that would see the aussie dollar back down towards yesterdays lows

4039591 here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat

4039657 estoy planteando que vayas con el procurador capitalino si hay un secuestro para sentar las bases de esa confianza porque hay personas que compran el seguro fuera de m xico y eso promueve el secuestro
4039658 es decir las bandas de secuestradores si saben que tienen un n mero importante de personas seguro pues se va a promover el secuestro porque se vuelve un negocio seguro para ellos
4039659 yo tengo la informaci n de que asesor a la familia pero negociador es la persona que se planta y establece una negociaci n con la familia y los secuestradores en t rminos generales un secuestrador no autoriza a que una persona ajena a la familia entable comunicaci n con ellos

4039671 its been a decent start but with hurlford and vics lying in wait the bigger tests are still to come
4039672 at last weve got a centre half who can head the ball away and doesnt take any chances while davie is a real powerhouse in midfield
4039673 were also moving the ball round really well and theres a bit of pace up front
4039674 but the big plus is that the players whove come in all know each other and the team spirit and willingness to work for each other is terrific
4039675 its early days but already i feel that this is the best team ive had since i took over at meadow park
4039676 it was hugely disappointing not to take something from the hurlford game and i felt over the piece a draw would probably been a fair result
4039677 our passing was good and we dominated possession for most of the game but just couldnt find that killer touch in front of goal
4039678 however i was delighted with the result on saturday although our passing could have been better in the first half
4039679 it is important that we win both of these games and get some momentum going and get that winning mentality

4039757 i dont consider jamaica to be any less difficult an opponent than the other ones that were going to face
4039758 that might sound strange but i never was an nfl fan not even when i was in the nfl i dont watch a lot of the cfl games on tv either i watch enough film during the week when im at home i like to watch stuff like the young and the restless talk shows things of that sort always been that way
4039759 but youre not going to be in the grey cup or out of it win or lose
4039760 you just dont want to peak early you want to be 7 2 after labour day not 7 2 before it thats not the kind of football team you want
4039761 thats just how this league works you do what youve got to do to get into the playoffs and to me thats determined after labour day
4039762 i love football and i watch it but im just not an nfl pre season guy

4039770 if you lose him for a while its really going to hurt us
4039771 i made pitches when i had to and slowed down the game
4039772 it seems like i start out pretty well and ive struggled in the last couple of outings in the middle innings by giving up a couple of runs i was able to back off the mound a little bit
4039773 you know getting in those positions where you have runners in scoring position and making pitches
4039774 we knew we were going to the quarter finals before the game and that was a bit of a factor in our strategy
4039775 i dont think there is any reason for us to lose confidence over the results because the results havent shown how weve been playing
4039776 weve been head to head with them so many times especially recently we are in the mindset now that its our turn to win
4039777 dont give up on us the games are not over the medals are going to come we want medals too
4039778 theres no margin for mistakes against these guys said despatie of the top eight field

4039784 arturo was affected by his forward approach dives thats where his weakest link is anything that was facing forward when hes affected by his nerves you could see he lacked stability that threw some of his timing off and the judges were really focused on exact timing in this event
4039785 i cant play with gravity very well despatie shrugged when asked if he might not have been able to slow down a tad accommodate mirandas lesser thrust
4039786 we used to have this little joke that we always hoped alex felt just a little bit sick
4039787 its disappointing to finish my career like that he said
4039788 we definitely have a small percentage at every game that we have issues with
4039789 weve really focused on turnarounds on parking lots on people coming in the building inebriated were just not letting them in the building weve taken a real strong approach
4039790 thats really an issue we havent had our situation wont change a lot because weve had a very detailed fan behaviour process for the last three or four years
4039791 doing anything and everything you can for the fans to keep them happy is what its all about let the fans be the fans they create the atmosphere for our games even when we drive up to the stadium theyre great they tailgate pretty good

4039802 id certainly trust what icc security expert reg dickason says after spending some time with him so ill have to wait and see what he says
4039803 it is obviously tricky because if you are in a position like me having only played a dozen or so internationals you certainly worry about giving your place up and not winning it back

4039812 just the sheer one day game you have to add a slightly different thinking to your cricket
4039813 but i am going back to northants playing as much cricket as i can and looking forward to developing other areas of my game which excites me
4039814 i am looking forward to playing for northants until the end of the season
4039815 it definitely excites everyone because of the context of the game what its about
4039816 if you drop a catch you could lose everything if you take the catch you get everything its pretty black and white so its quite exciting
4039817 i think twenty20 is exciting it adds another dimension to cricket and more importantly i think it is getting more people involved in the game
4039818 there are spectators out there who might not have been interested in cricket
4039819 why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy listen carefully to me and eat what is good and let your soul delight itself in abundance
4039820 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4039821 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4039822 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4039823 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4039824 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4039825 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4039826 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4039827 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4039828 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4039829 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4039830 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4039831 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4039832 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4039833 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4039894 ihr habt abgestimmt und euren klaren favoriten gek rt wir werden die seite nun umsetzen lassen schaut also immer mal wieder bei brands4friends vorbei
4039895 ich denke dass das augenmerk nicht so stark auf das vip gelegt werden sollte
4039896 wer wie ich mitglied in mehreren der neuen einkaufsgemeinschaften im netz ist der wird oft von der f lle der t glich eingehenden e mails er schlagen mehrmals am tag werden wir aufgefordert uns irgendwo eine vorschau anzusehen uns f r irgendetwas anzumelden oder aber noch besser gleich munter zuzuschlagen da das enorm herabgesetzte produkt nur noch f r wenige stunden verf gbar ist
4039897 to score a deal on coveted designer goods you no longer have to battle the crowds at least not in person luxury items without the luxury price tag are just a click away online shopping clubs like ideeli com ruelala com and gilt com are slashing prices on designer clothing and accessories and selling them through their members only websites
4039898 traditionally vips rely on word of mouth to gain access to exclusive sale events these happenings often occur in a back alley without signage and well after closing hours now thanks to the internet there is no need to peek down darkened streets
4039899 1 depending on your product you can use one of the growing number of online private sale services vente privee is arguably the most famous of all of these in europe but more seem to be springing up koodos offers a fairly simple private sales service for example
4039900 id go as far as agreeing that private sales are an alternative to ebay but really i dont buy it and im sure that neither will anyone else why as a retailer would you want to do a private sale on a site thats unknown and numbers its visitors in hundreds rather than hundreds of millions yes theres the chance to get a higher price than you would on ebay but is the extra work involved in inviting people to the sale and the cost of publicising the sale really worth that effort lets not forget this is old stock or its overstock isnt it better to just get rid of it and concentrate on your current stock
4039901 i want to apologise for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners
4039902 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process
4039903 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
4039904 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
4039905 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
4039906 its important to focus on the present this is a young team but weve behaved maturely and it happened naturally were able to handle things
4039907 i didnt feel sharp the last time i pitched here
4039908 i wanted to be aggressive and stay aggressive that really worked out i feel like if i stick to my game plan it sets me up for success
4039909 his last two outings are as good as ive seen him in a long time hes always been a winner
4039910 but if you want to test a mans character give him power
4039911 ive had my share of issues since i left miami i feel responsible for being able to manage the public relations better
4039912 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
4039913 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
4039914 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
4039915 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
4039916 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
4039917 if they continue to develop were going to have a good situation at that position
4039918 we had a personnel grouping today where we played three tight ends at once
4039919 we have a personnel grouping where we play two tight ends and two receivers and those guys would be called the y and the u
4039920 then we have a regular personnel group where we have the fullback and a running back then we have a three wideout formation where we have an h and a running back and a tight end and two wideouts in the game then we have a y as a receiver which is four wideouts and an h and two receivers
4039921 im not doing the math on it but its probably 18 19 guys and then you have role players some guys are really good third down backs sometimes you have a guy that really plays good in the slot and he just plays h or whatever i think the more guys you have and the more roles they play the better morale you can have on your team and i think its good how we can do that those multiples are what helps you utilize personnel
4039922 tight end is a great mismatch position so it would be great to have a guy who is a mismatch player at that position im talking about the passing game and theres only been a few of them even in pro football
4039923 thats one of the difficult things to defend like antonio gates in san diego or tony gonzalez has been for years with kansas city those kind of guys can really give you problems defensively because they usually dont have the best guys defensively covering them
4039924 if they can block too then you cant put in a cover guy to cover them because you really cant stop the run then hopefully well get someone like that in the near future get some of our guys to play that way that would be a real asset
4039925 i think were going to be a lot more involved in the passing game
4039926 mcelwain expects us to block just like our previous coaches our emphasis is on blocking and to be fundamentally sound but were trying to open up the field a little bit
4039927 setiap film buat saya adalah sebuah pembelajaran kalau memang peran saya terlihat hampir sama di tiap filmnya itu lantaran genrenya aja yang selalu komedi
4039928 ketika hati kita senang ketika hati kita memang humoris maka apa yang kita buat dalam film komedi akan lebih sempurna karena kita merasa nyaman
4039929 dan sekali lagi saya senang dengan komedi karena latar belakang saya di atas panggung juga berasal dari komedi
4039930 saya banyak belajar dari mereka apalagi dengan meriam bellina saya belajar bagaimana harus fokus dalam peran meskipun atribut atau kostum yang kita pakai akan membuat kita tidak nyaman

4039935 ser una eliminatoria muy igualada cre a que me iba a costar m s entrar en el equipo tras mis problemas pero todo ha ido fenomenal
4039936 el rival es fuerte es un equipo muy inc modo que juega al f tbol si pensamos que pasar va a ser f cil nos equivocamos
4039937 el depor es el favorito aunque vamos a pelear para intentar dar una sorpresa
4039938 el ambiente hay que vivirlo no se puede contar para nosotros la nuestra es la mejor afici n como supongo que dir el deportivo de la suya
4039939 en nuestro estadio se va a jugar otro partido all seguro que no va a haber tantos espacios como hemos encontrado en el campo en madrid no jugar n tan abiertos nosotros tenemos que tener paciencia y aprovechar nuestras oportunidades
4039940 nos falt profundidad para ganar tuvimos la pelota pero no bamos adelante cuando m s profundidad tuvimos nos hicieron el gol
4039941 no es el mejor resultado tuvimos intenci n de marcar pero nuestros intentos no fueron positivos pero a n faltan 90 minutos el partido ser muy diferente y se jugar en otra circunstancia jugamos ante nuestra gente y en el vicente calder n estamos seguros de que podemos pasar
4039942 en el primer tiempo fuimos superiores creamos mucho peligro pero s lo pudimos hacer un gol eso es lo nico que puedo reprochar a mis jugadores
4039943 el atl tico de madrid cre m s peligro en el segundo tiempo sabemos que tenemos una ventaja importante en la eliminatoria pero no es definitiva

4039954 ive only ever dreamed of winning an olympic medal since i was six years old and im so close now
4039955 you never know how the countback score is going to go and i was praying to god to let me win
4039956 there was a lot of pressure on me because the olympics is the biggest sporting event going and it has been a long week for me with the rest of the team doing so well that added to the pressure
4039957 it puts even more pressure on you when youre getting all these messages and you dont want to let anybody down ive been getting hundreds of them and the support back home has been amazing
4039958 billy joe is awesome already so hes going to be doubly awesome in 2012

4039978 hindi television serials have become one of the major sources of entertainment and advertising gateway for promoting upcoming hindi movies today according to our tv ratings viewership sees a unprecedented rise if the starcast of a film comes on a tv soap and it is informative also as people come to know about the story
4039979 when actors aamir khan and imran khan came to promote jaane tu om salman khans dus ka dum the show got one of the highest trps on that day this is just an extension of other promotional technique on television he adds
4039980 i think in todays world promoting through only one medium is not enough and tv serials are just an extension of marketing startegies if a star a of a film comes on a tv serial it helps in incrcease in both the serial and the film
4039981 movies to move the audience have to be marketed competently with effective promotion proper distribution channels and state of the art facilities and so on movies are promoted with a target audience which eventually determines the box office success rates and these soaps have a very good reach among the viewers and so can connect easily with the audience
4039982 the motto behind promotional activities is to draw the audience to the cinema halls any gimmick would sell provided it gels with the target audience mindscape
4039983 avenues have changed some television serials are so popular that even housewives who really dont care about films get to know about it after seeing the stars in their favourite soap

4039989 in many respects saakashvili got too close to the us and the us got too close to saakashvili perhaps that made him overreach
4039990 victory in this war with no consequences for russia will reinforce antidemocratic forces in russia increase the militarization of its foreign policy and encourage russia to take more risks elsewhere on its borders
4039991 nothing meaningful can be done as a matter of american policy if there is no consensus among european states that this represents something deeply shocking
4039992 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4039993 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4039994 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners
4039995 one of them clearly he missed i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
4039996 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this olympics would have been remembered for unfortunately
4039997 first they called her name up then they did not even put her name up even though the chinese had finished it was totally unusual holding

4039999 i felt i tried the best i could and made one mistake which cost me two targets im disappointed with my score but not my performance when its not your day its not your day
