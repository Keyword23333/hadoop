3810050 i wasnt on that show to be a reality star i was on there to get a job in the ufc
3810051 its great to be in the ufc but a fights a fight whether youre in the ufc or in joe shmoes backyard barbecue show
3810052 its still a fight and every fights still dangerous im just glad i got the opportunity to be in the ufc and fight the best guys now
3810053 hes a tall southpaw so it definitely creates a challenge there but i feel like his biggest weakness is that hes never really been tested in really tough fights hes pretty much dominated everybody that hes fought and i plan on really putting him to the test and finding out what hes really about
3810054 for me i never really thought i was taking the hard road
3810055 im just a fighter they ask me to fight and i fight i never thought of it as oh this is too hard of a fight or stuff like that this is my job and thats what i do
3810056 everybody takes their own path and if it works for them it works for them but thats just not my style i fight whoever they want me to fight
3810057 i wouldnt ask for anything less of myself and thats the life of a champion
3810058 you take your eyes off the prize and thats when things start going wrong
3810059 there were things about it that were tough but overall it was completely worth it
3810060 there were definitely a lot of guys that caused distractions and that were there for the wrong reasons but i had seen the show enough beforehand that i knew what to look forward to and i was mentally prepared that i was gonna have to deal with that sort of thing while i was there i kept my focus and never even thought about anything else the only time it really started to suck was after i lost then things start getting to you
3810061 i know its one of the tougher divisions but if you become the champion here that says a lot more than being the champion in a lesser one
3810062 i dont know my timetable here i just train as hard as i can every day and i dont think about the future i just think about my next fight and thats it i lay everything on the line for every fight and do every single thing in my power to do my best in my next fight and what happens after that who cares

3810066 in addition to commodity xl having the product functionality that could run our business we wanted a supplier that we could trust and depend on for a successful long term relationship
3810067 in short order triple point became the clear choice from both a technology and team standpoint commodity xl has the functionality to manage our trading risk and physical operations and the triple point team possesses the knowledge and dedication we require to build a relationship and grow our business for years to come
3810068 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3810069 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3810070 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward

3810073 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3810074 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3810075 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3810076 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3810077 if the business mix shift towards wholesale banking continues we believe the underlying profitability of the group will be undermined particularly if the benign credit conditions deteriorate as asian economic growth slows
3810078 one of the least likely to need a rights issue or face financial distress
3810079 it is clear that the adverse market conditions affecting the residential sector will continue for some time to come
3810080 in light of the current market conditions we intend to reduce the running rate of our overhead costs by 10pc by the end of this financial year
3810081 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity
3810082 it needs to continue to reduce debt levels to protect it against a more dramatic downturn in the uk residential market than we predict and afford it the headroom to expand through acquisitions once market conditions are right to do so
3810083 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3810084 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3810085 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3810086 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3810087 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3810088 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3810089 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3810090 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3810091 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3810092 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3810093 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3810094 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3810095 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3810096 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3810097 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3810098 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3810099 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3810100 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3810101 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3810102 our first concern was we didnt ever want the jokes to be on vets or war or the horrors of that
3810103 thats where we calibrated our scopes how do we constantly keep the jokes on actors hollywood and how hollywood works
3810104 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3810105 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3810106 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3810107 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3810108 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3810109 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3810110 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3810111 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3810112 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3810124 celebramos la idea de que las autoridades bolivianas estar n dispuestas y ser n capaces de destinar fondos de bolivia para tambi n atacar este problema
3810125 nuestras cifras indican que aproximadamente un 88 por ciento de nuestro financiamiento va directamente a asistir a las autoridades bolivianas y a trabajar en enfrentar problemas antinarc ticos

3810129 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3810130 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3810131 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3810132 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3810133 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3810134 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3810135 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3810136 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3810137 copycats a crime he or she sees in the game
3810138 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
3810139 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
3810140 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
3810141 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer
3810142 when managements are this unloved platinum group metals prices are weak and interloper risk is low xstrata have a fair chance of taking this home at the offer price
3810143 we believe there is a good chance that johnston press will announce a specific costs target or signal a significant exercise is under way to improve efficiency
3810144 the ferag finishing lines we have acquired recently give us the opportunity to relocate finishing from greaves to our other print sites thereby improving efficiency and reducing transportation
3810145 this closure represented another hammer blow to the print and packaging industry which is already reeling from the closures of curtis and beith and the announced job cuts at sappi and johnston press
3810146 which would you prefer a reduction to previous levels of power supplies or some form of manpower system based on employing more full time staff but flexed on some form of average hours basis which would you choose
3810147 we feel that it is important to us to be among the first to get on board improving access to care is an essential part of our mission

3810152 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3810153 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3810154 i spent so much time at junkyards i never want to see another one again
3810155 we spent two months straight prior to the race literally tearing the car down and replacing every part on the motor
3810156 and one way to do that is make sure its a really crappy car and you have to make it run anyway
3810157 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3810158 the fates have conspired against us but i am now ever more determined to go again next year
3810159 we always said that every mile we sailed would be an achievement in its own right and we have to try and take some positives from this years efforts
3810160 i have enjoyed the wonderful experience of night sailing and the tranquillity and sense of freedom that brings
3810161 i also feel incredibly privileged and proud to have been supported by such a great crew who despite extremely testing conditions and circumstances continued to show commitment and resilience of the highest order
3810162 the integrated navigation and control system is a combination of off the shelf items and custom built electronics

3810167 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3810168 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3810169 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3810170 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history

3810173 at obagi medical we pride ourselves on being business partners with physicians and delivering innovative skin health products
3810174 with the launch of our solubilized bpo technology as a prescription only product in the pharmacy channel we continue to offer more options to our physicians the launch of soluclenz rx gel will help dermatologists not only meet but exceed their patients
3810175 i was in complete shock i hadnt thought about anything but having another baby with this donor it was just so surprising and bewildering
3810176 taxes should be continued by annual or biennial reeactments because a constant hold by the nation of the strings of the public purse is a salutary restraint from which an honest government ought not wish nor a corrupt one to be permitted to be free
3810177 it has long been seen as likely that one of the bigger telecommunications equipment players would be interested in tandberg like cisco and hewlett packard
3810178 under our expanded charter announced last year we are branching out in new directions such as power consumption while continuing to move ahead with our graphics and workstation application benchmarks
3810179 the overriding objective is to apply spec s expertise and proven methodologies in areas that provide the most value to users vendors and testing labs worldwide
3810180 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3810181 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3810182 under our expanded charter announced last year we are branching out in new directions such as power consumption while continuing to move ahead with our graphics and workstation application benchmarks

3810189 so any reduction in outlook might be viewed as disappointing
3810190 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3810191 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3810192 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3810193 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3810194 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3810195 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3810196 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3810197 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3810198 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration
3810199 distilling subject concepts from opencyc vol b1 overview and methodology
3810200 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians

3810205 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear
3810206 instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater

3810221 the us patent and trademark office may have a major problem on its hands the possibly unconstitutional appointment of nearly two thirds of its patent appeals judges such a constitutional flaw if legitimate could call into question the hundreds of decisions worth billions of dollars in the past eight years the flaw discovered by highly regarded intellectual property scholar john duffy of george washington university law school could also afflict the appointment of nearly half of the agencys trademark appeals judges

3810223 regional security and fraternal cooperation iran considers implementation of the peace pipeline project as an effective and helpful step which should be finalized and made operational as soon as possible
3810224 in our strategic gas export plan we have allocated 150 million cubic meters per day for export to europe via pipeline
3810225 would give iran an economic life line and increase its leverage and influence in south asia u s policymakers argue that allowing the ipi pipeline to proceed would encourage the iranian regime to defy the will of the international community develop nuclear weapons and support terrorism

3810229 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3810230 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3810231 the georgian side could still maintain lower gas prices they could compensate for gas price by trading off some assets for example armenia had already paid gazprom with its transportation network
3810232 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3810233 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3810234 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3810235 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3810236 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3810237 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3810238 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest

3810241 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3810242 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3810243 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3810244 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

3810255 power plant modifications must include required emissions controls to protect public health and the environment
3810256 these air pollution controls coupled with local environmental projects will improve air quality for all the people of arizona and improve visibility at our national parks
3810257 this settlement marks a significant step in controlling harmful nitrogen oxide emissions in the western united states
3810258 the installation of state of the art technology sets an important benchmark for the control of this harmful pollutant epa is committed to ensuring coal fired power plants comply with the clean air act
3810259 the reductions in harmful emissions secured by this settlement are substantial and will have a beneficial impact on air quality in arizona and downwind areas
3810260 srps willingness to settle rather than litigate the various issues in this case allowed the parties to focus their efforts on securing the best results for the environment the justice department will continue our efforts to pursue emission reductions from power plants across the country to achieve the benefits envisioned by the clean air act

3810266 this is because of the commonly recognized importance of semantic metadata in effectively supporting various media related activities such as intelligent search and retrieval of media assets web
3810267 the impact of technology upon metadata collection costs courvoisier or cold duck
3810268 this paper focuses on the impact of technology on the cost of metadata
3810269 we compare these costs within representative media and entertainment workflows when using either traditional or modern file based technologies projections regarding the ongoing impact of technology upon metadata costs will also be examined
3810270 until best practices emerge this area will be subject to significant upheaval and innovation
3810271 is there room for standardization here will these technologies be applicable to other areas this papers purpose is to provide clarity to this important and evolving issue
3810272 service oriented architecture solutions have been used by it departments in banking and other fields for more than a decade

3810274 the port has committed to protecting local air quality throughout their facility but its really encouraging to see that same commitment extended to reducing impacts at a sediment remediation project this sets a new standard for future cleanup actions in the portland harbor
3810275 i am happy that steve finnan has agreed to return to international football he is an experienced player
3810276 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know
3810277 stephen ireland has told us he is not yet ready to make himself available but has indicated that he may do so in the future as i have said before my door remains open
3810278 first of all i want to express my sincere thanks to irek smaga for his effort devotion and contribution to sakus development we have been discussing with irek for some time and he expressed his wish not to prolong the contract and be able to spend some more time with his family due to the fact that they still are in poland we respect ireks decision and im happy that he can get back to his family and i wish him a great success in his new challenges veli pekka tennil is a person motivated by challenges and im confident that pekka with his great commercial experience in beer and other beverages business management and proven leadership skills is the right leader for saku at the current moment
3810279 i have always liked challenges and trying myself out in new situations im honored to take the top manager position in a highly respected estonian company which is also well known in my home country
3810280 i am convinced that experience gained in the finnish and other markets will help me to even more strengthen position of saku brewery which is already the market leader
3810281 the community toilet scheme is a common sense and cost effective solution to the lack of public toilets in london it is also an ingenious way around the high costs normally associated with running them
3810282 older people and families with young children in particular find the lack of publics loos inconvenient and an incredible burden when out and about
3810283 in the longer term however i want the government to face up to its responsibilities and provide londoners with the greater public amenities they deserve by changing current legislation and providing local authorities with more funding for essential services
3810284 the community toilet scheme is an excellent example of how boroughs can take simple steps to make life that little bit more convenient for their residents several boroughs are already running the scheme in their local area and im sure many more will now answer the mayors call and set them up for their communities
3810285 we are delighted the mayor of london has singled out our scheme for praise and recommended other councils to consider adopting a similar initiative
3810286 the community toilet scheme is an innovative idea where the council supports local pubs cafes and shops with an annual sum in exchange for which they welcome visitors to use their toilets freely and without having to make a purchase we now have 75 premises signed up all over the borough since the scheme was introduced we now have more toilets kept clean and safe and open for longer hours than ever before
3810287 toilet humour might be funny but not being able to go out due to a lack of public toilets is a daily reality for more than half of older people with social isolation becoming an increasing and very real problem its great that the mayor is urging councils in the capital to take a lead by making it easier to access toilets help the aged has called for a change in the law to make it a duty for local authorities to provide more toilets in public places
3810288 revision of this strategy underlines the importance that the government places on obtaining all the information necessary to enable us to tackle the development of antimicrobial resistance effectively and share up to date information with stakeholders
3810289 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
3810290 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation
3810291 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the twenty first century
3810292 what is going on there is so far beyond what the general public around the world is allowed to see
3810293 well apparently within the framework of well prepared plan several hundred pieces of russian equipment russian airborne troops commanded by head of airborne troops of russia certain with the rank of general landed there and expelled and certainly killed part of the population the whole population from that place is gone this is classical case of ethnic cleansing
3810294 what i least want is for somebody to take advantage of the image of manfred to bring about a confrontation between members of cochabamba residents thats why today i am letting the secretary general of the prefecture to continue this work while i conduct the pertinent legal affairs and while i show that the decree of the electoral court was harmful to justice in bolivia

3810314 i would have voted for the born alive infant protection act in illinois had it been worded the same as the federal bill i think thats the position the democrats should take
3810315 now the holy spirit tells us clearly that in the last times some will turn away from what we believe they will follow lying spirits and teachings that come from demons these teachers are hypocrites and liars they pretend to be religious but their consciences are dead
3810316 the fcc should be careful what they wish for if network operators cant manage traffic loads one way theyll need to do it another by banning discrimination based on application or content the fcc and net neutrality proponents more broadly are pushing network operators closer and closer to what is increasingly their only viable alternative option usage based pricing ubp might just be the best thing that ever happened to the network operator crowd and it might be the worst thing that ever happened to applications and content

3810320 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless
3810321 i last saw isaac a while back in washington d c at a concert where we were both performing although he was under the weather he was still performing he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls god bless his family
3810322 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a true renaissance man singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
3810323 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten
3810324 isaac was one of the more genuine and beautiful souls i have had the privilege to cross paths with and befriend in this life he was an incredible friend this is a tragic loss my heart goes out to his wife and children wherever he is going to just became a brighter and more beautiful place and i will miss him dearly
3810325 i owe so much of my fame and success to isaac hayes as it was isaac who wrote produced and actually invented what is known as the
3810326 the glass toys provide a unique feeling of fullness and emptiness at the same time
3810327 it goes beat for beat with the bass of whatever youre listening to
3810328 a lot of the new products are being make with vixskin instead of regular silicone
3810329 for the boys we have a lot of really nice prostate stimulators
3810330 we definitely keep up on the newer models of the rabbit
3810331 as the older models go out of style people arent as interested anymore
3810332 yeah the extra money is nice and ive come to depend on it and it helps me live in boston and travel and do fun things
3810333 but honestly bartending is a huge part of me i would feel lost without it i would not be me without it ive just been doing it for so long and ive been at the same bar for so long and some of my best friends work there every night is really long and hard but its just so comfortable
3810334 the money i think is probably the biggest draw of bartending
3810335 but especially where i work where the restaurant is small we have a lot of regulars who come in and you kind of feel like youre part of a small family back there
3810336 once you do it you dont want to go back and do the regular joe schmo nine to five thing
3810337 also its so flexible you can bartend three nights a week and have four days off to yourself and still make that same amount of money youd be making if you were working nine to five
3810338 i guess ive gotten to that stage where its probably less to do with the money and more to do with a good social outlet
3810339 youre working full time in a suit and tie every day so being behind a bar is like a social outlet for me the people i work with at the bar people who come in seeing my friends its like being out but being behind the bar
3810340 being a bartender allows me to be out be in that kind of social atmosphere be where theres a lot of really interesting things going on and meet a lot of interesting people without having to be spending money and without having to be drinking
3810341 by closing time ive had a long day ive been up since maybe seven 7 30 and its 1 30 in the morning and im wiping down liquor bottles and beer coolers and dreaming about my bed
3810342 sometimes i get a little uncomfortable when they ask questions about how much i make or whether im working on a certain night
3810343 it can be tough to work until two or three in the morning and wake up a few hours later for work i dont want them to think it will influence my job performance thats important to me
3810344 youve got an order of 10 drinks youre three deep at the bar and youre remembering it may sound kind of cheesy but prs like that too
3810345 you have sometimes eight to 10 clients or five things going on a day three events youre working on and i think bartending has just given me the skin to balance and take whats thrown at me
3810346 since im a big portrait painter i see people who are happy laughing having a nice time and i can take that vision and put it onto canvas
3810347 my day job is a very people oriented line of work it involves a great deal of relationship building interpersonal skills communication skills i think people who work in the service industry particularly the front of house bartenders waitresses cocktail waitresses that kind of thing learn a lot about people and how to interact with people from different backgrounds different age groups and i think you translate that into the real world
3810348 you definitely learn how to deal with people especially when theyre drunk
3810349 you learn peoples true colors when theyre in that state
3810350 years ago when i first started bartending one of my managers said to us youre always on stage when youre a bartender no matter what
3810351 i dont think ill be able to do it forever but i think ill do it until it starts feeling like a chore or its interfering with anything else in my life
3810352 im sure at some point ill hang up my beer opener and my shaker glass
3810353 when it stops being fun or if it starts interfering with my career thats when i hang it up
3810354 it takes four men to dress a salad a wise man for the salt a madman for the pepper a miser for the vinegar and a spendthrift for the oil
3810355 people think you have to have greens to make it a salad
3810356 at lunchtime everyone gets together and everyone eats off of one big plate but before anyone brings a plate to you they bring salad thats something you dont share
3810357 there are a lot of warm salads like spinach cooked with spices then kept in the fridge and served cold
3810358 people were asking for salads with chicken and this and that so it just made sense to offer the meats and spreads and veggies on a bed of greens instead
3810359 that was all garnish material to me until i tried it now i love it theres a real depth of flavor you dont expect
3810360 we take classic components and mess with them the goal is to make it the best salad anyone ever had achieving that goal is constantly evolving
3810361 you get a vibrancy you dont get from salad greens
3810362 people like to personalize dishes with ingredients they like we provide the canvas on which people can create their own palate
3810363 adding proteins changed the definition of salad about 10 or 12 years ago
3810364 by adding international elements it becomes even harder to define
3810365 oh my god i really do want to live here
3810366 where he made a splash pronto dante demagistris joined by brothers damian and filippo quickly took the plunge with
3810367 wouldnt it be great if you opened a restaurant in belmont center right next to your dads hair salon
3810368 yes that would be nice but how can we make it work without a liquor license
3810369 why the hell is he working at a high volume bar the first night he started
3810370 i was in new york but the acting jobs were few and far between so i became a bartender
3810371 i think a lot more hookups happen behind the bar than over the bar
3810372 when youre stuck behind the bar with someone you can become so close so fast
3810373 plus if a customer talks to me and we exchange numbers then he needs to leave if he sticks around and gets annihilated that number is going in the trash
3810374 because its cash if you want to go out one night and just drop 300 on a bottle of wine you look at it as thats tomorrow nights shift
3810375 its like they have a point to prove a good bartender needs to move fast
3810376 if you drop a bottle and the glass breaks in your ice thats the worst possible disaster that can happen to you
3810377 if you try that at the beehive youre in trouble
3810378 i was at a bar one night in cambridge and the bartender kept flipping beer bottles
3810379 it took him forever to make any drinks because he was showing off i wanted to kill him i killed him with my eyes
3810380 people request it all the time and whether or not you do it depends on policy
3810381 we will have a drink with customers with discretion if its someone i know will be responsible about it then its okay
3810382 as the bartender as soon as you step behind the bar its like youre hosting the party
3810383 you might do it in camaraderie to go over the top for a guest so they can feel like they werent making you work
3810384 but i tend to steer away from it its not a power issue its just weird but i do love when someone orders a sick bottle of wine and doesnt finish it then tells me to try it for them to offer up an opportunity like that is the best thing
3810385 i manage a bartender who once took an order for a bottle of cristal and they offered her a glass
3810386 it makes me laugh at all of the drink names from the 80s
3810387 and that there are only two bartenders at each of the crazy full bars
3810388 with regard to a life where one tries to do something else but ends up behind the bar
3810389 the movie is a little more glamorous than the actual job
3810390 you can break in ice break waste money etc etc etc
3810391 your gonna break do it your gonna smash a 40x30 mirror behind you do it people dont go to nascar races to watch the race
3810392 yeah man were not going to have that many plates
3810393 you wanna try it on you can come in and wear this chef coat youll cry in an hour
3810394 i have never been to beehive but whoevers running that kitchen must be an idiot
3810395 oh i want to grow up and i want to be emeril
3810396 what do you mean i have to work 80 hours a week
3810397 yeah great bays got some awesome black bass ive never had black bass let me try it
3810398 i was a sous chef in michigan for three years and i never got to go to an event
3810399 you know that chef and you know that chef and how do you guys all know each other
3810400 well its like a little incestual scene you know we all know each other a little bit
3810401 all right people you dont have to go home but you cant stay here lets keep it moving move it on out
3810402 she said im not really interested in maybe some other time and he said would 10 make a difference
3810403 if you tried to influence their vote in any way like if you said register and vote for this particular candidate now that is illegal
3810404 three individuals were in a vehicle driving through a parking lot when they were assaulted by one shooter maybe two

3810587 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3810588 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3810589 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3810590 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3810591 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3810592 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely

3810595 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

3810600 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3810601 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

3810609 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

3810625 a las rebajas y no a la contenci n de los precios
3810626 deve assumersi le sue responsabilit e mettere fine a questa crisi

3810633 it is very much inward frustration as i thought i could put him lucky star up to the scores we want
3810634 pay no attention to that editor behind the curtain er hemisphere
3810635 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3810636 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3810637 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3810638 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3810639 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3810640 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3810641 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3810642 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3810643 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3810644 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3810645 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3810646 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3810647 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3810648 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
3810649 if you want to get stuck by a train youre in the right town

3810653 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3810654 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3810655 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3810656 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3810657 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3810658 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3810659 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3810660 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3810661 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3810662 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3810663 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3810664 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3810665 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3810666 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3810667 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3810668 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3810669 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3810670 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

3810672 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3810673 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3810674 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3810675 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3810676 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3810677 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

3810681 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3810682 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3810683 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3810684 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3810685 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3810686 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3810687 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3810688 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

3810700 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3810701 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3810702 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3810703 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3810704 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3810715 you never knew because it changed from day to day
3810716 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and we had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3810717 one morning he called and asked me to meet him in town
3810718 i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and casey said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me

3810724 plus i have never heard of these problems from anyone before this sensationalist article came up today
3810725 the humble moggy or domestic cat maybe a cute little family pet to those in the rest of the world but to australias wildlife it is a born killing machine and once the cats have adapted to life in the wild they are even more devastating
3810726 the little suckers go from 5 000 10 000 depending on the generation
3810727 there are only a few thousand of them out there all domesticated this is a non issue they are trying to play up

3810733 its not fair we are taxed at 35 while joe schmoe is taxed at only 10
3810734 and where would the money for this nationalized health insurance industry come from
3810735 he government accountability office said 72 percent of all foreign corporations and about 57 percent of u s companies doing business in the united states paid no federal income taxes for at least one year between 1998 and 2005
3810736 the report did not name any companies the gao said corporations escaped paying federal income taxes for a variety of reasons including operating losses tax credits and an ability to use transactions within the company to shift income to low tax countries
3810737 but if you tax corporations they wont be able to make money the value of their stock will drop and theyll be forced to out source labor to stay competitive further hurting the economy blah blah blah
3810738 about two thirds of corporations operating in the united states did not pay taxes
3810739 the cost of producing their goods salary expenses and interest payments on their debt
3810740 corporations escaped paying federal income with an ability to use transactions within the company to shift income to low tax countries

3810750 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3810751 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3810752 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3810753 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3810754 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3810755 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3810756 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3810757 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3810758 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3810759 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3810760 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3810761 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3810762 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3810763 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas

3810790 were trying to understand what is going on inside this brain material that could have direct implications for human health
3810791 clearly brain cells have evolved to reconnect under almost any circumstance that doesnt kill them
3810792 i think the bursting is a function of sensory deprivation
3810793 with no structured sensory input the hypothesis is that you get arbitrarily random and quite often detrimental activity because all these cells are asking for some kind of direction
3810794 it seems that sensory input is setting the background level of activity inside the brain
3810795 its like training an animal to do something by gradual increments
3810796 this system is a model everything it does is merely similar to what goes on in a brain its not really the same thing we can learn about the brain but it may mislead us
3810797 if this kind of work can make a 1 per cent difference to the life of an alzheimers patient it will be worth it
3810798 ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea

3810820 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3810821 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3810858 prender informazioni e far un atto di censura verso lesercente prendendo provvedimenti i prezzi a tusa non sono per niente alti solo un bar vicino al mare e un po piu caro ma un panino non costa certo 10 euro
3810859 basta sommare i 30 centesimi del panino ai 50 centesimi del prosciutto 20 grammi e i 20 centesimi del formaggio 20 grammi con il banale risultato di un solo euro per uno spuntino di tutto rispetto
3810860 se questi signori torneranno chieder loro altri soldi non vero che hanno mangiato tre panini erano in otto e si sono divisi tre filoni ognuno dei quali corrisponde a tre porzioni

3810865 civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down of all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
3810866 i like the people at our record company but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one and yes it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say f you to this decaying business model
3810867 i always thought the internet it was a great thing and obviously the people it hurts are the big labels and i think thats ironic and great because the internet changes the dynamic all of a sudden it takes away the marketing advantage that the big labels have and it gives people a chance to listen to music they couldnt hear on the radio or get in a wal mart and to say i like it and i want to buy it were banking on this social contract if this is music you like and you want to support its not that much money you should do it people are smart enough to understand that concept
3810868 and its strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky are next to mountains anyway

3810881 bill martins actions today sadden me because he has issued yet another report riddled with inaccuracies and falsehoods this new report contradicts his own record of voting without objection for the budgets and policies he now so vehemently criticizes
3810882 at our july 19 meeting bill tried to convince the board to abolish our balanced budget policy and in a 6 1 vote failed to convince even one trustee to join his ridiculous idea that you can balance a budget by borrowing money from reserves or other funds
3810883 this reminds me of years ago prior to our current management team when the college was reprimanded for borrowing funds from a retiree trust fund to balance the budget and was forced to repay those funds back to the retiree trust with interest
3810884 despite bills desperate attempts to paint the college in a negative light respected community leaders agree sierra college is better off than it was four years ago bill needs to issue a retraction and apology to all six of his board colleagues
3810885 im a firm believer in looking at the results and aaron has achieved results at sierra college he has worked to balance the budget build up strong surpluses and make it possible for the college to make it through this economic downturn without massive cuts im proud to support him for re election
3810886 before aaron was elected our budget suffered tremendous cuts he has worked diligently to make sure the budget is balanced and he has protected our academic freedom all our community has to do is to look at our financial standing and take a look at the curriculum which has been approved in recent years as proof of aarons performance as a board member i strongly support his re election

3810890 hell you watch cnn surf the web and talk with people on the net all the damn time of course you can make good conversation
3810891 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3810892 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3810893 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3810894 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3810895 my responsibility as a council person is to the residents of hartford
3810896 im not responsible for securing our borders im not responsible for issuing visas

3810922 its yours anyway god and ill do whatever you want me to do with it
3810923 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
3810924 people who preach prosperity tend to forget and leave out the places in the bible that say that as followers of christ we may very well see tough times
3810925 giving god his tithe first the firstfruit of my paycheck 10 second paying all my bills and not creating bills that i dont have the money for and then giving whatever else is in my heart to give to other ministries commonly referred to as offering

3811006 for a long time the pop market never seemed to allow the beauty of a voice and said it belonged in the opera house or to musicals or somewhere else probably myself luciano pavarotti andrea bocelli our sort of group of people have forced the situation so that the pop market does now recognize beautiful voices also

3811056 on october 1st without that extension of the moratorium the ocs and shale formations become available for exploration if pelosi wants to control that at the federal level before the states start issuing leases and permits she has to cut a deal with the republicans all this means is that pelosi has recognized political reality
3811057 probably more accurate to say that she is open to not being crushed in november she can read the polls and an overwhelming majority of americans support the republicans position that it is important to develop our own energy resources pelosi says she could support drilling or a vote anyway if drilling is part of a broader strategy
3811058 so much for saving the planet nancy pelosi needs to save her skin
3811059 maybe do nothing nancy should enter the olympic diving competition she gets a 10 for her flip flop flop monday on drilling it is now no longer the hoax she knew

3811062 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful
3811063 our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
3811064 the torching of houses in these villages is in some ways a result of the massive russia propaganda machine which constantly repeats claims of genocide and exaggerates the scale of casualties
3811065 by day five of a conflict one normally expects that there is some kind of list of the dead and injured or at least an indication of their age and gender but here there is no information absolutely nothing
3811066 it is increasingly difficult to demonstrate that buying a renewable electricity tariff is offering additional carbon emissions reductions
3811067 businesses signed up to green tariffs based on the evidence available at the time but their choices have been producing only limited additional renewable generation capacity
3811068 many companies bought these tariffs in good faith but there are no guarantees that they actually save carbon they didnt pay much of a premium for the carbon savings they could claim in their marketing statements so they have basically been given a free ride
3811069 theyre worried about being ranked badly nobody wants to come bottom of a table of their peers
3811070 this is a serious problem for a number of companies who have followed the governments guidelines and gone out and purchased green electricity and are now being told that green source is no longer valid

3811087 it was a long way off so i was never really worried that it would do any damage

3811091 the idea of a model health certificate is not a bad idea in itself but its just impossible to police and to govern
3811092 thats why it hasnt been implemented at this stage because theres just no way of doing it
3811093 whos to say that a girl who gets this certificate lets say its valid for a year isnt going to be ok in six months time or a years time you just dont know
3811094 the british fashion council have stepped away from one of the fundamental recommendations of the model health inquiry
3811095 fashion is fantastic it can be wonderful but there are some aspects of it that are still actually quite toxic
3811096 i feel like god handed me the answer to all my prayers amp then just decided to take it all back i feel like ive been robbed of everything god just gave me
3811097 gods not punishing you by taking everything away from you

3811101 it is curious that south ossetia which is one of the world leaders in the production of counterfeit dollars with a great deal of humor deals with the fact of the production of false russian passports in the republic
3811102 the entire caucasus world laughed over the reliable but humorous report of an unknown ossetin author in which president kokoita having received freshly printed passport number 2 number one was sent as a gift to putin found instead of his own photograph a portrait of abraham lincoln taken from a one hundred dollar bill
3811103 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this
3811104 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
3811105 it was used in concentration camps in world war ii and by saddam hussein against the kurds in the 1990s

3811119 this years weak economy has resulted in extremely volatile ad markets with major advertisers scrambling to allocate budgets where they will get the most bang for the buck
3811120 companies that publicly report ad sales for their cable nets showed positive second quarter results spanning a wide range from 1 to 28 however we expect to start seeing more negative numbers in the second half of 2008

3811122 the unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up because that means he has to stop dwelling on himself and start paying attention to the universe unhappiness is the ultimate form of self indulgence when youre unhappy you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself you get to take yourself oh so very seriously

3811125 a coming of age story about a group of young men and women in belfast in the late 1960s who are involved with a local soccer team at the start of a 30 year civil war some are drawn into the conflict while others stand aside wanting only to be allowed to live and love in peace it is a story of ordinary people in an extraordinary situation told with humor and compassion in a powerful and passionate musical both funny and heartbreaking the boys in the photograph pulls no punches when exploring the reality of sectarian conflict but is nonetheless a joyous celebration of the freedom that love can bring
3811126 andrew and i were very proud of the beautiful game but it wound up being a very dark and grim show when we opened there were still acts of terrorism taking place between england and northern ireland and that influenced us we chose i think mistakenly to leave our hero not only unredeemed at the end of the story but morally destroyed as well and thats not the kind of message andrew and i like to leave with an audience
3811127 the dream is that the canadian world premiere will prove hugely attractive to north america in general and who knows where it will go after that

3811137 you wouldnt want other students making fun of your kid would you
3811138 it has been three years now that we have been looking forward to the new car
3811139 it was just a matter of sticking with it the old car was a frozen specification and there was never going to be anything new on it
3811140 we knew exactly what we had from the start of this year
3811141 we have had our fair share of disappointments over the last few years but we are still hungry for it and we still go to every event thinking we can win or certainly be on the podium
3811142 we have never lost confidence in ourselves or the team everybody is working very very hard i think when the first victory comes in the new car it will be a very very sweet one
3811143 the main thing now is that we get this new car sorted out by the end of the season then we can start 2009 with a proper attack on the championship that is the priority at the moment
3811144 i dont see any reason why we cant win in the second half of the year the car is looking good
3811145 probably a little bit later on in the season is more realistic japan or wales rally gb time we should start getting stronger now and if we can get onto the podium in any position we will be very very happy
3811146 it is looking very very good the car is just so well balanced compared to the old car and that is crucial on tarmac
3811147 it seems like an awfully long time ago now that we won the title in 2004 2003 2002 and even 2005 we had a real rollercoaster ride we won many many events we won on snow we won on gravel and we won on tarmac we proved that we were an all round crew but then it has been just disappointment ever since it will turn around though and we will have a lot of fun again i can guarantee you that

3811151 google has not made any recent change to georgia armenia and azerbaijan in google maps
3811152 we do not have local data for those countries and that is why local details such as landmarks and cities do not appear
3811153 reports i told the rangers supporters assembly at a private meeting last friday that all monies from sales would be returned to the manager are accurate thats what will happen
3811154 for me playing in this match would be special and if i can score that will also be nice but only if we win
3811155 i know a lot of people from my time at hearts and enjoyed playing football there
3811156 i had a good relationship with the fans and also managed to score quite a lot of goals some against celtic and rangers
3811157 but this is now in the past and all i want to do is score goals for rangers and help us win games
3811158 i want to show our great fans what i am capable of so all i can do is work as hard as i can in training and hope i am selected for matches
3811159 like every player i want to be involved all the time but we have a lot of forwards at the club right now and it is up to the manager what he decides to do
3811160 i was very happy to score my first goal at falkirk last saturday but the main thing was to get three points and make a good start to the season
3811161 we needed that after what happened in lithuania last tuesday we knew we had to turn things around so winning the game was the most important thing
3811162 i think hearts have a good squad right now and they still have some very good players
3811163 kingston has a lot of qualities as does andrew driver i also feel that christophe berra has a lot of potential
3811164 so this will be a difficult game for us but i am confident we can win
3811165 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready
3811166 considering he missed most of last season we would hope that he would be injury free now
3811167 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
3811168 madjid boughherra came in last weekend and did very well kirk broadfoot has been playing centre half since pre season started more or less and he has been doing well too
3811169 i think it is his best position he played most of his games at full back last season because of the consistency shown by carlos cuellar and davie
3811170 he has had the chance to show what he can do this season and he has done well
3811171 in general none of us are like god i cant wait to give everybody a taste of my parents record collection
3811172 i got asked the question do you prefer beach boys or beach house
3811173 blue ridge is definitely one of the more visceral ones for me to play so i really enjoy that
3811174 a lot of the songs just because we approach the writing so differently they each sort of present their own challenges that were still getting to know
3811175 in general theres things that pecknolds sort of pulling from his personal life and things that hes pulling from archetypes or fables that he can use with personal experiences and sort of map them together
3811176 i was following the pack all swallowed in their coats with scarves of red tied round their throats to keep their little heads from fallin in the snow and i turned round and there you go
3811177 skye he is a television archivist at this point he chooses to retain that knowledge by quizzing me were talking very specific references from the entire cosby catalog he can instantly humble you very quickly
3811178 david the gnome is the only one that ive actually been able to beat him on were talking like season one taxi very obscure non sequitur kind of stuff
3811179 one thing thats curious to me is that there has been a preponderance of people thinking that we are nostalgic people but if you actually met us i think youd be very surprised to not find us nostalgic when we were writing and working on the record it felt very much like present day activities as opposed to sort of like digging up graves
3811180 i dont think people that only listen to old music are to be trusted nostalgia to me isnt any different than futurism theyre both representing a desire to experience an idealized sense of reality that they feel is lacking from their own

3811190 a range of tailored jackets many deconstructed along with cropped pants baggy shorts and a variety of skirts in stretch wool
3811191 i have given a bit of thought to this scenario
3811192 it will be hard facing ulster jerseys instead of playing with them however i am pleased my first experience in bath colours will be in familiar surroundings for me it is a nice anecdote that i will be playing back at ravenhill where i gave my best
3811193 the move to bath has gone well so far i wanted an opportunity to still play top professional rugby coming to the guinness premiership is a big challenge for me and my time at ulster was a great experience for me and was very rewarding for me it was about looking for a change a new opportunity and a chance to expose myself to a lot of risk
3811194 there are a large number of international standard players here particularly in the second row the challenge for me is about getting as physically fit as possible for a season that will be physically demanding and be mentally prepared that if there are setbacks along the way that i handle them as best i can

3811200 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
3811201 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
3811202 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
3811203 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
3811204 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3811205 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
3811206 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
3811207 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3811208 recentemente fiquei sabendo do interesse do botafogo na minha contrata o e tenho contrato com o catar de um ano e meio ainda primeiro tenho que resolver a minha libera o l para depois pensar em voltar ao futebol brasileiro o meu empres rio est l tentando resolver para que eu volte ao futebol brasileiro ou por empr stimo ou de prefer ncia definitivamente
3811209 o botafogo um grande clube e j vem bem h muito tempo se recuperou agora no campeonato brasileiro e minha prefer ncia por equipes assim que s o de chegada e lutam por t tulos
3811210 acho que a perda de alguns jogadores acabou nos complicando e fez com que o flamengo ca sse um pouco de produ o
3811211 um jogo importante fora de casa contra uma equipe que n o vem bem no brasileiro estamos procurando subir na tabela e uma vit ria fora de casa vai nos ajudar bastante nisso
3811212 tenho contrato at 2011 mas sabemos que quando uma proposta vem dif cil para o clube segurar estou feliz aqui tranquilo e o que for melhor vai acontecer
3811213 essas duas semanas que vim treinando me fizeram bem foram importantes para recuperar a forma f sica trabalhei muito neste per odo e estou disposi o do treinador caso ele decida mesmo me escalar

3811232 um mundo diferente agora um mundo que mais aberto e mais destrutivo de alguma maneira
3811233 nos interesa m s ser segundos en el target comercial
3811234 pr cticamente empatada con tve aunque somos segundos en el target comercial que es lo que realmente nos interesa tanto por razones comerciales como estrat gicas ya que el p blico joven es el que garantiza tener un proyecto de futuro
3811235 esto analiza es signo de que las cadenas estamos empezando a tener m s paciencia con los nuevos contenidos que ponemos en marcha porque la mayor fragmentaci n por la diversidad de cadenas as lo exige
3811236 se les dedica m s tiempo de emisi n para que la gente los conozca y demuestre su capacidad de competencia no todos son xitos pero s tienen la confianza de las cadenas que en pocas anteriores los hubiesen quitado porque los renovados eran menos de la mitad
3811237 antena 3 es la cadena que m s productos ha estrenado y la que m s ha renovado para la pr xima temporada como es el caso de las series
3811238 si en la anterior temporada ten amos un programa nocturno como era buenafuente ahora hay programas de emisi n semanal
3811239 hemos mejorado en el horario de m xima audiencia que es la m s competitiva y lo hemos hecho por la fuerza que ha tenido la producci n propia
3811240 y estamos muy satisfechos de las que se han estrenado este a o como f sica y qu mica
3811241 hemos mejorado en el horario de m xima audiencia y el cine de antena 3 es el que tiene mas audiencia entre el contenedor
3811242 esto demuestra que la ficci n es un g nero que va a ir a m s que tiene un perfil prioritario para una cadena comercial porque cuando se consolidan garantiza m s solidez
3811243 la buena noticia es que somos la cadena l der hasta las cuatro de la tarde con programas consolidados que ya estaban desde temporadas anteriores como
3811244 en este rea los nuestros ganan hasta los 65 a os y por encima de esa edad tve de forma que el resultado es un empate t cnico
3811245 el punto d bil reconoce pello sarasola es la tarde porque mientras en el horario de m xima audiencia la oferta de antena 3 tv se adec a al target comercial en la tarde no hemos acertado lo suficiente
3811246 la noticia mas grata es el xito del estreno de
3811247 continuar la mejor a en el horario de m xima audiencia y reforzar la apuesta de ficci n con el estreno de dos nuevas series cazadores y doc de producci n propia
3811248 y la misma oferta de cine que no ha crecido porque lo hemos ido sustituyendo por producci n propia que es m s competitiva y al ser un producto tuyo lo manejas con m s libertad

3811250 lo que pide youtube est fuera de lugar y no tiene sentido
3811251 actually the first time i was on stargate atlantis was not as dr keller
3811252 a wraith with a heart of gold she was raised by humans and all she wanted was to be loved and accepted
3811253 lots of people are used to seeing me as kaylee from firefly who is very innocent and naive and sweet shes loving and kind of wears her heart on her sleeve and dr keller is not that she has secrets she is reserved she has a lot of anxiety about her she doesnt really warm to people right away but she also has that same quality that kaylee had where shes pretty much friends with everybody
3811254 thats fun to play because i get to interact with all different types of characters on my show
3811255 keller and teyla rachel luttrell are kidnapped and they go through this really perilous situation and she has to step up to the plate and let go of her fraidy cat instincts
3811256 she develops a little bit of a bond ill call it with ronon jason mamoa
3811257 i think keller knows in her heart that she should not pursue her relationship with ronon but its just this physical attraction but she has a very intellectual attraction with mckay and i think she understands him in a way that a lot of other people dont when hes complaining and going on and on about how terrible things are and how sick he is or whatever she just kind of has a way of dissipating that in him and going okay you know what rodney just chill out so yeah with those two shes eventually going to have to make a choice
3811258 in saving the horse harry became an instrument of the divine
3811259 when we make the only choice possible and that is to love then all of us become what we were intended to be we are the power
3811260 in saving the horse harry became an instrument of the divine
3811261 when we make the only choice possible and that is to love then all of us become what we were intended to be we are the power
3811262 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
3811263 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
3811264 oh my god can i come and work for you people
3811265 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
3811266 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
3811267 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
3811268 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
3811269 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
3811270 desde o in cio olhava as telas e sonhava em ser ator de cinema
3811271 o culpado s o os estados unidos que prejudicaram minha carreira eu queria atuar mas n o havia produ o de filmes suficiente porque o p blico s queria ver filme americano
3811272 chegar a gramado e receber uma homenagem de um festival de cinema me faz crer que a minha op o estava certa
3811273 je pensais que la travers e du d sert durerait plus longtemps
3811274 elle croit quelle m rite la parit et elle a raison
3811275 actually the first time i was on stargate atlantis was not as dr keller
3811276 a wraith with a heart of gold she was raised by humans and all she wanted was to be loved and accepted
3811277 lots of people are used to seeing me as kaylee from firefly who is very innocent and naive and sweet shes loving and kind of wears her heart on her sleeve and dr keller is not that she has secrets she is reserved she has a lot of anxiety about her she doesnt really warm to people right away but she also has that same quality that kaylee had where shes pretty much friends with everybody
3811278 thats fun to play because i get to interact with all different types of characters on my show
3811279 keller and teyla rachel luttrell are kidnapped and they go through this really perilous situation and she has to step up to the plate and let go of her fraidy cat instincts
3811280 she develops a little bit of a bond ill call it with ronon jason mamoa
3811281 i think keller knows in her heart that she should not pursue her relationship with ronon but its just this physical attraction but she has a very intellectual attraction with mckay and i think she understands him in a way that a lot of other people dont when hes complaining and going on and on about how terrible things are and how sick he is or whatever she just kind of has a way of dissipating that in him and going okay you know what rodney just chill out so yeah with those two shes eventually going to have to make a choice
3811282 it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting
3811283 so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking l4d tour will allow visiting members of the press as well as the general public to sample the zombie heavy action title
3811284 im talking with the muslim leaders may muslim kagawad kasi kami sa bayan ng aleosan were trying to reach out na sana wag na dumating sa point na yon we have a muslim board member in aleosan we hope a religious war will not happen
3811285 and of course kino contain natin yung anger and hatred ng mga christians dahil nga sila ay nasunugan we are trying to contain the anger and hatred of the christians over what happened to their houses
3811286 side by side christian and muslims naninirahan ng matahimik at mapayapa sa community ngayon pumasok dito yan si umbra kato para whatever magnakaw gumuwa ng mga atrocities kasalanan niya sa bayan yan kung itoy lumago before kato came into the picture the christians and the muslims in the area were co existing peacefully there is no one to blame but him in case a religious war occurs here
3811287 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all off season
3811288 im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss im going to try to crush all of em
3811289 playing green bay on monday night to start the season thats everything you want
3811290 hopefully i can put my helmet square in the back of his spine if i can do that and knock the ball loose itll be a good day
3811291 adrian saw her with shia and that was kind of it the crash their hanging out he obviously didnt appreciate it
3811292 man id hate to have tickets and be late to this game
3811293 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3811294 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3811295 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3811296 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3811297 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3811298 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3811299 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3811300 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3811301 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3811302 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3811303 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3811304 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3811305 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3811306 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3811307 why do people take up a whole spot for the cart instead of just returning it
3811308 another way to do it would have been to offer to help
3811309 ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea
3811310 it has taken a while to get the deal done and there has been a bit of compromise on both sides
3811311 personally im very happy and i hope ive made the fans happy
3811312 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of them
3811313 for the past few years we have been challenging for everything that is one of the reasons i wanted to stay
3811314 while we had approaches from inter milan we were never going to sell lampard chelsea never sell their best players
3811315 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3811316 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3811317 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3811318 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3811319 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3811320 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3811321 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3811322 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3811323 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3811324 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3811325 wah cher tell us how you met are you getting married
3811326 my boyfriend is shakespeare quit with the questions and take out now
3811327 men can sow their wild oats till theyre frigging 70 women have until 35 to give birth
3811328 db how could you walk around on that ankle why didnt you tell me it was so bad why have you been walking on it
3811329 its ok it feels better now than on sunday ive been icing it
3811330 come and stay near me please im afraid its going to hurt
3811331 is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3811332 for the purpose of gaining exclusive access to the lucrative replacement hip knee and joint industry and to the orthopedic industry in general
3811333 paid illegal kickbacks and provided numerous forms of illegal payments
3811334 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds
3811335 i think thats an event i can do well in and probably who could stay up the longest
3811336 just so you know thats supposed to be funny even though i am serious
3811337 one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity
3811338 well that was super good even if the guy was a neanderthal nazi
3811339 literature teaches us to be better noticers of the details in life which in turn makes us better readers of fiction which makes us better noticers of life and so on
3811340 a policeman is responsible for communicating fluently he must be able to speak well even with delinquents as his use of language improves so will his efficiency
3811341 a police officer must be worldly and books enrich peoples experience indirectly
3811342 risking your life to save other peoples lives and property requires deep convictions
3811343 solidarity with the besieged people of georgia also today postponed the start of his planned two week ranch stay
3811344 buddy the only place its going at 86 is boot hill
3811345 das was fr her die very high einstellung war hei t jetzt enthusiast und diese option ist jetzt auch unter dx9 zug nglich
3811346 wir haben die exklusivit t herausgenommen und uns gedacht wenn leute das auf ihrem rechner laufen lassen wollen warum sollen wir das einschr nken
3811347 wenn der rechner das darstellen kann weil die erforderliche performance reserve da ist dann ist das richtig
3811348 das war unser ziel wir wollen die furcht vom spieler wegnehmen dass er unser produkt nicht spielen kann warhead ist ein spiel das jeder spielen kann es wird mit einem pc der 400 euro kostet spielbar sein und zwar auf high settings das spiel wird mit einer sehr guten framerate also ich denke mit 30 bis 35 fps durchschnittlich laufen das war ja auch mit crysis schon teilweise m glich aber wenn man einen 2 000 euro pc hat der nicht gut konfiguriert ist dann hat der gegen einen 600 700 euro pc verloren der besser konfiguriert ist das hei t manche leute hatten 2 000 3 000 euro nicht in die richtige konfiguration investiert zu einem gewissen grad lassen sich diese optimierungen sogar f r crysis nachpatchen aber das wird viel zeit in anspruch nehmen weil die optimierungen ziemlich tiefgreifend sind wir sind noch dabei die schritte einzuleiten aber erst mal wollen wir warhead abschlie en
3811349 health care and the 2008 election comparing the candidates positions on health care
3811350 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
3811351 over the years the series has developed into a real classic of childrens television and thanks to a new release and a feature movie it is still popular with people of all ages
3811352 with its charm and diversity the game does justice to the popular series on which it is based on every platform
3811353 we feel that this game is the ea sports freestyle answer to a great wii party game it explores the lighter side of sports and pulls inspiration from the entertainment spectacles that are so prevalent in pop culture today
3811354 celebrity sports showdown will bring people to the party with a collection of games and celebrities that appeal to everyone
3811355 the mygames series provides girls with a new social outlet for interacting where they are encouraged to express their creative abilities through fashion and make up in an entertaining setting
3811356 the interoperability of nintendo ds combined with its popularity among the female demographic makes the system a perfect environment for experiencing my make up my dress up and my secret diary
3811357 the number one thing that people can do to keep from being bitten by a mosquito is to use an insect repellent every time they are outside
3811358 people should look for repellents that contain deet picaridin oil of lemon eucalyptus or ir3535 and always follow label directions
3811359 its a challenge to get men screened this new promotional campaign is designed to get their attention through something that gets their attention sports
3811360 people should avoid exposure to bats and learn to appreciate them at a distance
3811361 bats are a good indicator of the health of the ecosystem and they are important just as bees are normally they are not aggressive they can be infected with rabies even if they dont appear sick
3811362 economic consequences of pandemic influenza along the united states mexico border
3811363 we are looking for every opportunity to meet with different sectors of our community to make sure new mexico is prepared for the disruption to services and businesses during a pandemic flu
3811364 we appreciate businesses taking the time to learn about how they can develop plans to ensure minimal disruption to trade and commerce in the region
3811365 the economy that new mexico shares with mexico is so interconnected in terms of production and logistics that if we see a glitch in the system it could be catastrophic
3811366 business leaders have a responsibility to be part of the solution in dealing with a potential pandemic we must have measures in place that will prevent disruptions in the supply chain and have a plan to deliver goods and services if the workforce gets sick
3811367 nono just invited us over for dinner tonight at 7
3811368 that her girlfriend wants to go off and get married to some guy
3811369 sweetie can you go out and get something to take over to their house
3811370 i dont know but if he doesnt hell find out tonight
3811371 i remember the days when she couldnt even boil water
3811372 ta kun said you guys were holding hands when he answered the door
3811373 its early for her but she didnt take a nap today
3811374 sorry i couldnt get in here in time to stop the crying
3811375 because all for one amp one for all is getting a little sad
3811376 well i wanted to wait until noa gets older but i really want to come back
3811377 as the summer progresses it is important to practice preventive measures to avoid mosquito bites
3811378 mosquitoes that can carry west nile virus are active throughout clark county and in neighboring counties and states
3811379 we are proud of the work we have done to prevent hiv in new mexico and provide needed treatment for people infected
3811380 however we need to expand our efforts for atrisk hispanics after seven years of flat funding and resources from cdc
3811381 our statewide programs that provide clean syringes in exchange for used syringes have been successful in keeping hiv infection rates low among injection drug users
3811382 these programs give us the opportunity to provide ongoing education about how a person can reduce their risk of getting hiv the benefits to the individual and to the public health are huge
3811383 unfortunately about half of new mexicans are diagnosed with hiv when they have already progressed to advanced hiv disease aids
3811384 we need to be diagnosing people earlier in the course of their hiv disease when the benefits of treatment can be more fully realized new mexico law now makes it much easier for doctors to provide hiv testing in routine primary care settings
3811385 mays hawaii kalua brand pork with up to twelve percent solution added fully cooked smoke flavor added
3811386 one unique aspect of this report is that much of the information is from utah students who have asthma
3811387 were getting insight into how the disease affects them from their personal experiences and points of view
3811388 students with asthma shouldnt be on the sidelines when it comes to participating in school activities
3811389 with the right treatment students with asthma can stay active just like anyone else
3811390 slickedit core contains some of the most powerful editing and programming features available within any editing environment on the market today
3811391 cores mixture of power speed and flexibility allows even the most accomplished developers to write code faster and more accurately making it an indispensable plug in for serious programmers
3811392 have lost at least one permanent tooth to an accident gum disease a failed root canal or tooth decay
3811393 reform our tax code so that it rewards work and not just wealth
3811394 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3811395 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3811396 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3811397 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3811398 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3811399 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3811400 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3811401 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
3811402 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3811403 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3811404 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3811405 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly
3811406 nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
3811407 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
3811408 a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show all together
3811409 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
3811410 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
3811411 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
3811412 in my view this government is better than the taleban as there was no education economy or development
3811413 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy
3811414 security in itself is a challenge there are places where our de miners cannot go because of the security risk
3811415 its as close to kabul as logar and thats of a concern to us
3811416 we expect russia to honour its commitment to allow in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3811417 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3811418 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3811419 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3811420 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3811421 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3811422 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3811423 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3811424 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3811425 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3811426 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3811427 americans respect your courageous choice for liberty and as you build a free and democratic georgia the american people will stand with you
3811428 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3811429 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3811430 if they want to keep something for historical purposes its ok
3811431 id known about the interest for a few weeks so it was great to finally sign i cant wait to get out there now and show what i can do
3811432 there are some good quality players here but my job now is to try to push them and get in the team and get the club promoted
3811433 i want to play in the premier league with charlton
3811434 for the moment i am here on holiday with my family my future at chelsea i dont know anything yet
3811435 if players fancy a move and a bit of money then good luck to them but if theyre at such a place like this i dont think they realise how lucky they are to be playing here
3811436 there are obviously big clubs in the world but while certain people think it might be a progression if they move somewhere else i dont think it is i am lucky in that ive had everything i need im at manchester united and from manchester what more do i need
3811437 our most recent product is an indian macro fund which we will be raising exposure for in september

3811440 hearing loss is a growing cross generational health issue affecting people of all ages
3811441 this innovative relationship with hearusa will give aarp members access to a specialized hearing wellness program that focuses on education and quality of care
3811442 this relationship offers a unique opportunity to dramatically expand awareness of hearing loss in america and will offer easy and affordable access to professional solutions
3811443 it gives me great personal satisfaction to offer all qualified providers and manufacturers the opportunity to participate in this tremendous program

3811486 listening to the anthem with the medal around your neck is an amazing feeling
3811487 i am almost at a loss for words growing up i always wanted to be an olympian

3811502 i recently witnessed gangs of illegal gold miners in the rainforests of suriname in north eastern amazonia
3811503 the miners were blasting at river banks with pressure hoses devastating the ecosystem there once pristine streams had become malaria infested pools choked with sediment the water stained bright red or yellow and contaminated with mercury used by miners to amalgamate gold particles
3811504 because of such pollution indigenous and other rural communities in many gold bearing regions of amazonia often cannot find clean water to drink fisheries are being decimated too mercury accumulates as it moves up the food chain reaching dangerous concentrations in the larger fish that local residents rely on for protein
3811505 these firms are attracted to developing countries by low taxes and labor costs modest mineral royalties and relatively lax environmental laws they should shoulder a larger share of the burden

3811523 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3811524 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3811525 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3811526 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3811527 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3811528 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3811529 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake
3811530 parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake

3811559 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
3811560 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
3811561 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
3811562 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
3811563 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
3811564 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
3811565 our world is a few extreme events away from total catastrophe

3811655 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3811656 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3811678 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
3811679 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
3811680 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas home prices are projected to increase 3 to 6 percent in 2009

3811737 we really spent the last three days making sure that we were focused within ourselves not being afraid of failure and not letting that fear get in the way of having a good race
3811738 because the fear and the nerves can get to you and overcome your sense of ease that makes you row a lot better we just went out there trying to be focused and be loose
3811739 we just went through that over and over and over
3811740 we have a lot of confidence in our crew and we know from previous races this summer that we continually progress throughout the racing we seem to get better and better

3811742 fire eagle allowed us to easily add location data to pownce using their simple api
3811743 pownce users can now say where they are and geo tag their notes which adds a new dimension to the service
3811744 right upon sign up users are given the option to receive regular e mails from yahoo to see if they are still comfortable with sharing this kind of information
3811745 if you do not respond to this e mail yahoo will automatically disable your fire eagle account yahoo also allows users to turn the service off when they want to keep their location private
3811746 once it is running smoothly again we would not be surprised if fire eagle could make good on its promise of becoming the central clearinghouse for location services
3811747 already close to 800 developers are working on applications that make use of fire eagle in some form or another
3811748 while users have full control over their current fire eagle status which only includes their current position and keeps no log the partner services theyve signed up for may continue to display their location history indefinitely
3811749 fire eagle says that as part of the terms of service partner services must agree to let users delete their messages but this will be impossible to enforce ultimately it will be up to users to selectivity give their information to the services they trust

3811788 no existe un tipo de stoff ahist rico de la sexualidad un tipo de cargo sexual que pueda simplemente agregarse a la relaci n social para sexualizar dicha relaci n en una direcci n constante y predecible o que se separa de ella sin cambiarse o transformarse
3811789 por qu una sociedad de viriles guerreros cree que un ni o debe ser inseminado oralmente para hacerse masculino qu ocurre cuando esta convicci n se ejecuta a trav s de pr cticas homosexuales ritualizadas prolongadas
3811790 no existe diferencia en principio entre golpear a alguien en la cara o introducirle el pene en su sexo
3811791 ellos no pueden saltar a la esfera de lo ideal y pretender que el sexo los genitales es igual a las dem s partes del cuerpo
3811792 mucho de lo que est relacionado con el sexo heterosexual reproductivo no es er tico

3811800 las pr cticas homosexuales entre hombre y ni o como homosexualidad ritualizada impone un modelo occidental de la sexualidad a estas pr cticas melanesias un modelo que se basa en las ideas occidentales acerca del g nero el erotismo y la individualidad y que en ltimas oscurece el significado que tienen estas pr cticas en melanesia
3811801 ignorar desvirtuar trivializar e incluso invalidar los significados y deseos homoer ticos de los actores
3811802 desodorizar lo er tico y marginar la ontolog a homoer tica
3811803 los aspectos reales f sicos y er ticos de la homosexualidad muchas veces se ignoran cuando se trata de un comportamiento institucionalizado
3811804 la estimulaci n f sica directa de los genitales o situaciones ps quicas espec ficamente sexuales
3811805 un contexto rom ntico no es una condici n necesaria para la excitaci n sexual ni en hombres ni en mujeres
3811806 herdt plantea un ordenamiento tautol gico del erotismo que hace que la erecci n est sujeta a alg n tipo de excitaci n que es por definici n er tica

3811811 pero qu es atracci n hacia el ni o exceso de libido poder exhibicionismo fantas as de crianza lo que excita al var n adulto y acaso su compa ero m s joven tambi n siente excitaci n debemos representar la naturaleza de estos deseos como homoer ticos no homosexuales es decir como una forma de deseo y no solamente de conformidad social hacia un rol sexual
3811812 lecciones traum ticas de jerarqu a social para los iniciados las ense anzas rituales acerca de las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres inculcan entre los hombres la sospecha generalizada y el miedo a las mujeres mientras que simult neamente exalta las capacidades y la supremac a de los hombres al mismo tiempo estas ense anzas suministran ejemplos de una jerarqu a de g nero
3811813 una narrativa cl sica gr ficamente homosexual disimulada que esconde a medias el erotismo entre clare e irene
3811814 puede haber una diferencia entre desear a alguien sexualmente y desear el cuerpo de alguien
3811815 un deseo de ocupar de experimentar los privilegios del cuerpo del otro u otra no de amarlo o amarla o hacer el amor con l o ella sino m s bien usar ponerse como l o ella lo hace como una pr tesis o un fetiche

3811825 tocar cualquier parte sexual o ntima de una persona no casada con el autor del hecho con el prop sito de satisfacer el deseo sexual de cualquiera de las dos partes
3811826 el t rmino partes ntimas es mucho m s amplio que el t rmino partes sexuales
3811827 intimidad debe verse en el contexto en el que tiene lugar el contacto una parte corporal que puede ser ntima en un contexto puede no serlo en otros
3811828 es una formaci n discursiva y no un hecho o una propiedad del cuerpo
3811829 ustedes los niggers tienen que aprender a respetar a los oficiales de polic a
3811830 al tratarse de la brutalidad de la polic a trazamos un l mite cuando hay violaci n de un hombre
3811831 nos impide imaginar que los polic as que se especializan en t cticas violentas pueden encontrarlas excitantes
3811832 siempre nos han considerado como una comunidad fr gil y vulnerable
3811833 cuando se castiga la violaci n debe castigarse la violencia f sica y s lo eso puede considerarse como un acto de violencia posiblemente m s serio o m s grave pero del mismo tipo que golpear a alguien en la cara
3811834 el cuerpo queda marcado discursivamente al construir ciertas partes del cuerpo como m s importantes que otras
3811835 la sexualidad como tal tiene un lugar preponderante en el cuerpo el rgano sexual no es como la mano el cabello o la nariz
3811836 y qu hay de malo en eso los delitos sexuales son diferentes
3811837 ordenando en la medida en que estudia organizando sus movimientos en la medida en que observa categorizando en la medida en que sondea
3811838 las producciones disciplinarias de la identidad pueden convertirse en el sitio de lucha por los derechos que naturalizan y por consiguiente fortalecen los poderes de los cuales tales identidades son efecto108

3811853 esto se hace enjuiciando las agresiones sexuales no como delitos enumerados como tales como en el art culo 5 g sino como elementos usualmente el actus reus de los delitos
3811854 todo acto mediante el cual se causa a una persona dolor o sufrimiento severo ya sea f sico o mental con el prop sito de castigarla por un acto que sta o un tercero haya cometido o se sospeche haya cometido o intimidarla o coaccionarla a ella o a un tercero o por cualquier raz n basada en discriminaci n de cualquier ndole

3811856 es dif cil concebir circunstancias en las cuales la violaci n no implique de alguna manera castigo coerci n discriminaci n o intimidaci n
3811857 la violencia sufrida por una prisionera en forma de violaci n le fue inflingida por delic por el hecho de ser mujer

3811869 proteger las identidades de quienes depositaron su confianza en l y para salvaguardar los cultos rituales de la comunidad que siguen siendo una forma de vida reservada en el sentido estricto de la palabra los hombres sambia estipulan expl citamente que ning n fragmento de su documento original debe divulgarse dentro de pap a nueva guinea
3811870 se cree que la feminidad es inherente al desarrollo de la ni a por su continua asociaci n con la madre la masculinidad por el contrario no es un resultado intr nseco de la condici n de ser var n es un logro diferente al que se deriva de tener rganos sexuales masculinos la madurez reproductiva masculina debe ser inducida artificialmente mediante la pr ctica estricta de t cnicas rituales
3811871 es crucial que distingamos desde el comienzo entre identidad y comportamiento homosexual
3811872 el sexo sigue siendo uno de los temas tab en antropolog a
3811873 a lo largo de la primera mitad del siglo la mayor a de las alusiones por parte de los antrop logos al comportamiento homosexual permanecieron tan veladas por su ambig edad como complicadas en su formulaci n como lo son las referencias a la homosexualidad en el discurso dominante de la sociedad circundante

3811876 los hombres no s lo pasan el tiempo divirti ndose con los iniciados los ni os son sus primeros compa eros er ticos por esta raz n y otros factores de personalidad en ocasiones los solteros quieren apasionadamente a ciertos chicos en particular
3811877 acaso las relaciones de inseminaci n de los ni os expresan deseo er tico
3811878 una pr ctica puramente ritual que hace parte de las costumbres
3811879 es una redundancia necesaria decir que sin excitaci n sexual representada en erecciones por parte del inspirador y entusiasmo subido de tono en el ni o inspirado estas pr cticas sociales no s lo reposar an m s all de lo er tico sino que sencillamente no existir an
3811880 al parecer las emociones e impulsos diferentes a los er ticos pueden causar erecci n y actividad genital en los hombres as como en el babuino montar y penetrar para mostrar superioridad o sentarse en guardia con las patas abiertas y el pene amenazadoramente expuesto muestra una erecci n de un origen asexual posiblemente lo mismo que ocurr a con la gente de la edad de bronce en escandinavia o en el norte de italia que equiparaban la potencia f lica con el poder del arp n la espada y el hacha como puede verse en sus petroglifos
3811881 un castigo persa favorito impuesto a los extra os atrapados en el harem o gynaeceum es desnudarlos y lanzarlos y exponerlos a los abrazos de los novios y de los esclavos negros
3811882 la sexualidad no es no es el elemento m s inextricable en las relaciones de poder pero s un o de los m s instrumentales til para la mayor cantidad de maniobras y capaz de servir como punto de apoyo como eje de las m s variadas estrategias
3811883 los hombres sostienen que las mujeres los pueden contaminar por el simple hecho de pasar a su lado tocarlas o tocar su comida u objetos personales durante el per odo menstrual las mujeres se van de la casa y se retiran a la caba a menstrual situada cerca del caser o los hombres y los iniciados evitan completamente el rea de la caba a por su parte las mujeres no deben caminar cerca de la casa club de los hombres ni mirar hacia adentro
3811884 el deseo homosocial es una especie de ox moron homosocial es una palabra utilizada ocasionalmente en historia y ciencias sociales y que describe los lazos sociales entre personas del mismo sexo es un neologismo que se forma obviamente por analog a con homosexual y que tambi n obviamente debe distinguirse de homosexual de hecho se aplica a actividades como establecimiento de lazos masculinos que puede como en el caso de nuestra sociedad caracterizarse por intensa homofobia miedo y odio hacia la homosexualidad situar de nuevo lo homosocial en la rbita del deseo de lo potencialmente er tico significa por ende hipotetizar la ininterrupci n de una continuidad entre lo homosocial y lo homosexual

3811938 we are very pleased to be reporting substantial progress toward commercializing an important test to screen for down syndrome that can be administered as early as late in the first trimester through a simple blood draw from the mother
3811939 data from our blinded screening study for the detection of fetal aneuploidy indicate that the current version of our test has identified all down syndrome samples without any false positive outcomes also our coverage has improved to at least 93 of the u s population although these results require further validation in larger studies such results using sequredxtm technology can potentially transform current clinical practice for down syndrome risk assessment

3811954 the launch of this service will enable us to capitalise on the remittance opportunities that globalisation and economic migration offer
3811955 this service will provide the bank with a new revenue stream through access to a new customer segment that of the migrant workers
3811956 public banks customers can now send money via western union to more than 355 000 service provider locations in over 200 countries and territories within minutes without the need for a bank account
3811957 nevertheless upcoming events such as the 2008 beijing olympics and local festivals will help support a good growth for the entire 2008
3811958 we are not charging additional cost to the customers we are helping customers worldwide to reduce fuel consumption and in the long run to become more fuel efficient

3811966 shell is promoting the goal of fuel efficiency through our shell eco marathon which is currently being held annually only in europe and north america where teams of university students compete fiercely to produce a vehicle with the best fuel mileage over a given distance on the track
3811967 we in shell malaysia are preparing ourselves and trying hard to bring this eco marathon to the country we hope we are successful we will know the decision by the end of the fourth quarter
3811968 with world crude oil prices spiralling probably our asian university students would be able to come out with the best solutions on fuel efficiency
3811969 it is hoped that university students will be more aware and do more research and development in fuel efficiency

3811973 i was quite disturbed when i received a letter from the urban homesteading assistance board detailing their concerns about the financing for the 1520 sedgwick acquisition and other similar predatory equity deals in my district
3811974 i had already been at work on the 1520 sedgwick situation but these allegations deepened my fears about a deal that is being pushed against the will of the tenants and community i felt that writing to sec chairman christopher cox and bringing to the secs attention the facts outlined in uhabs letter to be the swiftest and perhaps most effective course of action i will continue to focus on this case while also working to ensure that affordable housing is preserved from unscrupulous developers both in my district and around the nation

3811982 if you agree that we should be working on solving energy issues then call your member of congress and tell them to take an active role in this effort
3811983 gas prices are very high and families are feeling the pain we are seeing the effects of high prices in businesses in charitable organizations in schools we are seeing problems in places we havent seen in many many years as a member of congress im embarrassed this is not the way we should run congress and the house of representatives our government isnt serving us the way it ought to be
3811984 i have a rural pa district all i hear from my constituents is energy energy energy i saw a woman at the supermarket she was a little angry she said whats congress doing about energy prices i met with some farmers they chewed me out for half and hour straight on energy

3811988 the public health of new bedford residents is paramount we will continue to closely monitor the water quality at all city beaches and will notify the public of any significant changes
3811989 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
3811990 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
3811991 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
3811992 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease
3811993 we see it over the whole park not just a single trail
3811994 its hard to make generalisations it can depend heavily on species as some are more affected by recreation than others
3811995 these animals have high intelligence and those that are cautious survive
3811996 we looked on and off trail and found low abundance off trail too in accessible areas
3811997 were not in any way advocating that people stop seeing nature
3811998 but were trying to heighten the awareness of site managers to these unexpected impacts on wildlife
3811999 were faced with decisions about how best to manipulate protected areas
3812000 perhaps we need areas set aside from virtually all human use
3812001 the apollo moon shot and the human genome project rallied support for massive r amp d efforts that created the capabilities to overcome obstacles that were not contemplated at the outset of these initiatives
3812002 similarly todays barriers to improving biofuels are significant but genetics and genomics can catalyze progress towards delivering in the not too distant future economically viable and more socially acceptable biofuels based on lignocellulose
3812003 over the past 10 000 years wild plant species were selected for their desirable traits resulting in todays highly productive food crops we simply dont have thousands of years in the face of the energy and climate challenges so by applying the power of genomics to these problems we are seeking to speed up the domestication of energy crops and the technologies for converting them to suitable biofuels as a more carbon neutral approach to meeting part of our transportation needs
3812004 with the data that we are generating from plant genomes we can home in on relevant agronomic traits such as rapid growth drought resistance and pest tolerance as well as those that define the basic building blocks of the plants cell wall cellulose hemicellulose and lignin biofuels researchers are able to take this information and design strategies to optimize the plants themselves as biofuels feedstocks altering for example branching habit stem thickness and cell wall chemistry resulting in plants that are less rigid and more easily broken down
3812005 using this prospecting technique we can survey the vast microbial biodiversity to gain a better picture of the metabolic potential of genes and how they can be enlisted for the enzymatic deconstruction of biomass and subsequent conversion to high energy value fuels
3812006 given the daunting magnitude of fossil fuel used for transportation we will likely have to draw from several different sources to make an appreciable impact with cellulosic biofuels all of which will in some significant way will be informed by genomics
3812007 toward this end rapid new sequencing methods and the large scale genomics previously applied to sequencing the human genome are being exploited by bioenergy researchers to design next generation biofuels higher chain alcohols and alkanes with higher energy content than petroleum and more adaptable to existing infrastructure
3812008 this funding will improve travel conditions at the pierre regional airport and help keep passengers safe
3812009 as a member of the senate appropriations committee i support ongoing efforts to improve transportation conditions in and around south dakota to help provide our communities with continued economic development opportunities a key part of my hometown prosperity plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a great example of that kind of investment
3812010 this bipartisan legislation will raise the deductibility for charitable mileage for volunteers from the current 14 cents a mile to about 58 cents a mile
3812011 this funding will improve travel conditions at the huron regional airport and help keep passengers safe
3812012 as a member of the senate appropriations committee i support ongoing efforts to improve transportation conditions in and around south dakota to help provide our communities with continued economic development opportunities a key part of my hometown prosperity plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a great example of that kind of investment
3812013 as a cancer survivor myself i have personally learned the importance of early detection
3812014 barbara always does a wonderful job with the cancer booth and i want to thank her for spearheading this effort i strongly encourage fairgoers to visit the mammogram van and cancer booth to learn more about cancer prevention and early detection
3812015 managing cancer begins with early detection especially breast cancer and prostate cancer
3812016 i am looking forward to attending the fair this year and i hope that all individuals visit the cancer booth and mammogram van to get tested and learn more about the disease
3812017 our hypothesis was that if we could artificially induce conditions like those produced by the armstrong strain it would help the immune system clear an infection by clone 13
3812018 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3812019 first they called her name up then they did not even put her name up even though the chinese had finished it was totally unusual holding
3812020 im sorry but im just thinking of the right words to say would you check out the questions on ya section ask anything without reprimand other than stylish hair accessories what can you use chicken bones for en espa ol
3812021 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3812022 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3812023 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3812024 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3812025 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3812026 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3812027 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3812028 we expect russia to honour its commitment to allow in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3812029 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3812030 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3812031 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3812032 were putting you in school before you get to school
3812033 therefore it is with great reluctance and yet a sense of conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3812034 generally boycotts help the box office rather than hurt it
3812035 i believe that the jews and every decent person who hates bigotry should go the whole nine yards and delete the entire movie by boycotting it for the whole message is odious and offensive
3812036 is there really a more serious charge against a people than that they killed god
3812037 i had no interest in seeing the film at least at first
3812038 but when everyone began complaining and debating on it i gained interest
3812039 the trouble is that all too often in human history churches and priesthoods have set themselves up to rule peoples lives in the name of some invisible god and theyre all invisible because they dont exist
3812040 while the movie was less offensive than the books it was still bait for promoting the book trilogy which was very much anti catholic
3812041 our goal was to discourage moviegoers from seeing the film and make the movie fail at the box office
3812042 we knew we met our goal when alvin amp the chipmunks brought in more money than the golden compass did
3812043 the fates have conspired against us but i am now ever more determined to go again next year
3812044 we always said that every mile we sailed would be an achievement in its own right and we have to try and take some positives from this years efforts
3812045 i have enjoyed the wonderful experience of night sailing and the tranquillity and sense of freedom that brings
3812046 i also feel incredibly privileged and proud to have been supported by such a great crew who despite extremely testing conditions and circumstances continued to show commitment and resilience of the highest order
3812047 the integrated navigation and control system is a combination of off the shelf items and custom built electronics
3812048 as a system it is still in development and working in what for electronics is a hostile environment
3812049 what we had not envisaged was the level of difficulty operating and maintaining the boat and her systems under the conditions we have faced
3812050 it is with regret that we have to announce the cancellation of our south american tour sincere apologies to all the fans and promoters involved but this decision follows the announcement of the departure of our drummer jeff singer we are committed to doing the 20th anniversary unholy trinity dates in europe with a stand in drummer but it will be impossible to find and appoint a new drummer in time for the shows in south america we hope to reschedule a south american tour next year
3812051 i guess no one would have seen this coming but as of the end of august i will no longer be drumming for paradise lost
3812052 so why am i leaving well to be honest it is a difficult thing to explain in a few paragraphs but here goes
3812053 i am sure you are aware that the record industry is struggling and i for one have become increasingly disillusioned with the music business as a whole
3812054 we toured so hard this past year we were basically away for five out of six months and are still out as we speak
3812055 coincidentally whilst i was thinking about my future i confided in my best friend who ended up offering me a job which will provide me with a good career and future which for a 37 year old man with nothing but drumming behind him was an offer too good to pass up
3812056 i appreciate the timing of my departure is terrible but september 1st was the start date for the job and i must go through with that
3812057 i feel with in requiem i have gone out on a high
3812058 i thank everyone involved with paradise lost and i wish you heartfelt good luck for the future i also thank all the great musicians i have played and toured with since 1986 and especially all the fans who have made it all worthwhile i am sure everyone will understand and respect my decision

3812082 were on the home court so everyone wants us to get a good result
3812083 i dont differentiate between strong and weak opponents i play each game like its a final
3812084 there was strong support for european peacekeepers there will probably be european peacekeepers
3812085 the idea of having monitors what you call peacekeeping troops i wouldnt call them like that but european controllers monitors facilitators yes yes and yes that is how europe should be on the ground
3812086 definitely european monitors have to be on the ground europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3812087 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3812088 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3812089 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues
3812090 when we start thinking about peacekeeping i think the eu should have a central role
3812091 the blame game and the tough talk will start at a later stage
3812092 i see no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3812093 you can decide to make strong statements with one sided condemnations or you can look to the future and take a real role in stabilising the situation
3812094 well its not a consumer product its really an office product so we dont get any demand for toner you could always try
3812095 youre telling me i could go home buy this same printer online with the same credit card then come back here and pick it up and it will only cost me 99 after rebate but if i buy it from you right now and you swipe my credit card its going to cost me over 200
3812096 it can be very crowded in the valley in the main place but the hermitages are a little bit removed from that
3812097 its simple its sort of celtic the design of the houses of the hermitages their stone the open fire and the rocking chair
3812098 some people need care they come very tired or maybe grieving or heartbroken
3812099 its to provide a space where they can heal and the silence does a lot of that too
3812100 it is something very kind of traditionally irish or maybe the word celtic is often used
3812101 the celtic kind of thing of the body being very important walking barefoot and being in touch with the earth and being out in the elements
3812102 i couldnt believe it the bill read fish cakes which one of us had for a starter and it was written right above it absolutely disgusting language we actually booked the table for 8 o clock in the evening by the time they had taken our order it was quarter to nine and we didnt actually receive our food until quarter past 10 id like a written apology from the restaurant and id also like some compensation i think that the way that weve been spoken to is absolutely outrageous
3812103 that shouldnt come out on the bill so weve got to find out whats gone wrong there but we have apologised unreservedly to the girls concerned and said that theyre very welcome to come back and have a free meal and wed like them to
3812104 i must stress once again that the fabled theme of the languid adolescent girl has nothing whatsoever to do with sexual obsession except perhaps in the eye of the beholder
3812105 i paint angels all my feminine figures are angels apparitions people think it is eroticism which is perfectly absurd my painting is essentially and profoundly religious
3812106 there is something obsessive about him he wasnt right in the head
3812107 there is something disturbing here the position of her legs her sexual awakening fire is a symbol of passion and that man with no shirt we dont know what he was doing beforehand or afterwards
3812108 then i put it all together i recognised happy days in a catalogue all the details but the fire and the man didnt exist
3812109 i have always performed in big sports events i dont know why this is maybe it is to do with the type of music i sing what it represents as it is very theatrical but yet it also has a very popular feel
3812110 ive had a very long career as my career from my first recording stands about 30 years i think committees organizing these things want someone with a lot of experience as there is a lot you have to go through and you have to deliver at the end of the day
3812111 for a long time the pop market never seemed to allow the beauty of a voice and said it belonged in the opera house or to musicals or somewhere else probably myself luciano pavarotti andrea bocelli our sort of group of people have forced the situation so that the pop market does now recognize beautiful voices also
3812112 ive made the most of the gifts i have been given my attitude towards my work has always been the same in that i have always given it everything i think if i hadnt i would have been mad at myself i have to give everything because i have a huge passion for what i do
3812113 i dont know because it is hypothetical if i have missed out on things i dont know and i have absolutely no regrets everybody has to stand up for their own decisions and i feel happy in the place that i am
3812114 never say never ive never felt as if i was a musical theatre artist it was never my choice of something to go and see and i sort of fell into it in a funny sort of way i love doing plays and i love doing what i do and that is very successful for me i cant see myself changing
3812115 all sorts of stuff my choice is really eclectic i have about 6 000 or 7 000 cds i wouldnt even like to go there
3812116 i dont do anything particularly i am not crazy about workout schedules or dance schedules i just carry on working yes i get jet lag and get tired and have to work hard but in a way it is all part of it i think it is happiness that keeps me looking good
3812117 the tank crew was unable to determine the nature of the object mounted on the tripod and positively identify it as an anti tank missile a mortar or a television camera
3812118 in light of the reasonable conclusion reached by the tank crew and its superiors that the characters were hostile and were carrying an object most likely to be a weapon the decision to fire at the targets was sound
3812119 there is no doubt that fadel shanas death is a tragedy
3812120 a journalist in action was killed by idf fire along with others not involved in the hostilities
3812121 however the available evidence does not suggest misconduct or criminal misbehaviour i have therefore decided that no further legal measures will be taken
3812122 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3812123 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3812124 these findings mean that a journalist with a camera is at risk of coming under fire and theres not that much that can be done thats unacceptable
3812125 please make sure the computer is not connected to the power supply
3812126 then i think there is something wrong with the computer itself

3812137 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3812138 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3812139 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3812140 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3812141 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3812142 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3812143 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3812144 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3812145 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3812146 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3812147 hes a very motivated individual the way he meets all challenges head on

3812177 we believe the sector will suffer from a slowdown in customer demand and a pick up in churn typical for a slowing economy this will in turn lead to further price competition particularly in the long distance markets volume growth is slowing at the same time that the long distance industry has added huge amounts of capacity unfavorable market conditions will likely limit access to new capital
3812178 these business models have high operating leverage and a slight slowdown in revenues will have a very negative impact on ebitda
3812179 we expect some of the smaller private clecs to go bankrupt which could pressure valuations in the sector

3812246 la criminalidad de los extranjeros es igual a la de los portugueses
3812247 la mayor criminalidad de los extranjeros frente a los portugueses se revela as una falacia

3812255 usted sabiendo esto deber a pagar por cada barbaridad dicha o firmada porque este tipo de periodismo de investigaci n criminal promueve la instigaci n de la gente por medio de la agitaci n social
3812256 es evidente que respecto de lo ocurrido en el bes estamos todos de acuerdo en repudiar este tipo de asalto realizado por brasile os como podr an haber sido ucranianos y perdone dr moita flores podr an haber sido portugueses

3812263 even at that time when kosovo future status was being discussed we unanimously recommended the supervised independence for kosovo because we knew there was neither any legality nor any fairness to ask kosovars to return under the belgrade rule after considering the fact how they were heinously treated mass murdered and ethnically cleansed by serbia
3812264 here is a contradiction because while russia was demanding to preserve serbias sovereignty over kosovo simultaneously russia was supporting the un resolution to implement the deployment of the un administration to run kosovo
3812265 resolution 1244 does not preserve the sovereignty of serbia over kosovo if we make a thorough analysis of the un resolution 1244 it does not state that the former federal republic of yugoslavia has to be asked or decide over the future status of kosovo on whether it will be independent or not
3812266 the declaration of kosovo independence does not set a precedent because in the last 15 years we have encountered at least 26 cases of countries that declared independence and became sovereign countries without any agreement with the country they lived under and the republic of kosovo is among them
3812267 the united states had tried to reach a new resolution over kosovo but unfortunately it was not possible due to objections from russia
3812268 this is not a unilateral act but it is a coordinated act by the effort of a large number of countries that worked on achieving this solution the independence of kosovo
3812269 this is a serious debate which the government of kosovo must participate in a very active way there are a few myths being created that reject the international recognition of kosovo independence among them is that resolution 1244 does not permit independence and that the independence is a unilateral act and so forth all of these are myths fabricated by the chauvinistic leadership of serbia that ignores to understand and learn the international law and resolutions

3812277 i dont really want to be portrayed as a champion for the disabled
3812278 contrary to what people might think my favorite subject to talk about is not how amazing i am
3812279 public anger over western support for kosovos independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote
3812280 in the run up to 11 may brussels and washington would be well served to lower levels of rhetorical support for the pro western parties
3812281 in particular eu leaders should not appease nationalist forces by offering a stabilisation and association agreement before serbia has met the long standing condition for it full cooperation with the hague tribunal
3812282 did not solve its problems but instead only intensified the never ending hatred between ethnic serbs and ethnic albanians pacification of the country which is still under un protection is only reality for the distant future meanwhile kosovo remains an experiment for an uncertain period of time and with an uncertain outcome
3812283 not my turn to die memoirs of a broken childhood in bosnia
3812284 you will show that right and justice may go unrespected in the world you will show that unfortunately this body of the world organization is losing its authority
3812285 we proceed from the understanding that serbia is a single state with its jurisdiction spanning the entire territory
3812286 form the foundation of energy stability for all of europe in the future
3812287 most of it in shares of state controlled energy enterprises including 4 5 percent of gazprom
3812288 all we want is to reduce the albanian population to a manageable level
3812289 intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group
3812290 israel has an interest in helping to establish a moderate secular muslim state friendly to jerusalem and washington in the heart of southeast europe
3812291 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land
3812292 then we looked at a map and woke up israelis have a population of six million their backs to the sea and 300 million arab enemies albanians have a total population of eight million our backs to the sea and 200 million slav enemies so why should we identify with the arabs
3812293 many palestinians also nurtured a similar sympathy for genocidal serbian dictator slobodan milosevic
3812294 what may be considered the most surrealistic gesture during the entire decade of recent balkan wars occurred six months after natos bombing of serbia on december 1 1999 the palestinian authority pa invited milosevic to bethlehem to celebrate the orthodox christmas news of this invitation although more or less ignored in the west was reported with banner headlines in the balkans an israeli foreign ministry spokesman said that if milosevic accepted the invitation he would be arrested on arrival since israel as a u n member is obliged to fulfill arrest orders issued by the hague tribunal which had indicted him the pa not being a u n member was under no such obligation and the pa was not the only palestinian element to vacillate over kosovo earlier in 1999 the palestinian islamic extremist hamas movement issued a statement denouncing u s intervention to settle the kosovo crisis as hiding under the slogans of human rights to impose its power in the balkans hamas thus echoed the allegations of milosevics own media as well as the russians and various leftists worldwide
3812295 at the moment foreign investors do not consider serbia as a heaven for financial investment
3812296 the situation is not alarming but we certainly should not neglect and underestimate it
3812297 we have had a week of stoppage crisis on the stock market attack against the dinar we should not let this period continue
3812298 it is important to separate the diplomatic effort over kosovo from what economic departments of the government are doing
3812299 if there is peace and order on the streets of serbia investors will continue to invest
3812300 persecute a people with enough savagery and they will in the end unite rise up fight and go their own way
3812301 as long as the serbian people exist kosovo remains serbia
3812302 many countries fear that their separatist groups could choose to emulate developments in the balkans
3812303 the west will have problems explaining why one is against republika srpska bosnian serb entity in bosnia when kosovos secession was deemed acceptable keeping the artificial state bosnia herzegovina together against the will of the bosnian serbs will in any case be difficult
3812304 not my turn to die memoirs of a broken childhood in bosnia
3812305 we want to see macedonia as a small oasis of forest
3812306 even as the potent mix of a misfiring economy and consumers changing media habits shave advertising dollars from traditional venues such as newspapers and television internet ad spending will continue to grow rapidly

3812314 president bush and karl rove are attempting to block voter registration of at least 200 000 and possibly as much as 400 000 veterans
3812315 bushs rules deny these people the right to register where they are recuperating
3812316 what i am reading is a bush appointed official banned the registration drives in may congress seems to have some bills in process to change this
3812317 who controls the dva who named its leaders who can remove said ban with an executive order anytime he wants to
3812318 bushs rules deny these people the right to register where they are recuperating
3812319 his failure to issue an executive order to the contrary may be frowned upon
3812320 bush should lift the ban but this one is the dems fault
3812321 so a failure to act is an act in and of itself
3812322 congress is having to take steps to correct this issue that the president could correct with a phone call
3812323 you do understand the concept of chain of command right
3812324 im not sure it applies as instantaneously as youd like it to
3812325 according to the logic of people like you a failure to do something about an existing law is to be considered an enactment of that law
3812326 if you are in charge and you have the authority to act and fail to do so then the responsibility is yours for better or worse
3812327 does that apply to senators or only to the president
3812328 no i mean it you are as bad as my parents
3812329 under 2002 did him in and he doesnt want to take risks any more i realize that both of these men talking are actually me
3812330 the more things change the more they stay the same

3812332 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him

3812334 compared to other agents weve worked with n halamine had all three components we were looking for
3812335 if a person is in a situation where there are hazardous materials
3812336 they dont want a false sense of security the acyclic n halamine coating is long lasting can be easily re applied and doesnt alter the fabrics comfort or strength
3812337 this project is part of an ongoing development that weve been working on for quite some time
3812338 we can combine these functions and create this clothing for other industries
3812339 its possible to create this clothing mainly for single hazards not multiple hazards
3812340 our long term goal is to develop something that can be multi protective
3812341 zucker has an appealing ruddy tint that lends him a cherubic appearance
3812342 when he sits back his feet actually lift off from the floor a bit like a boy taking a turn on someone elses throne
3812343 he then soils his diaper a mess quickly attended to by the youngest and prettiest of his three assistants
3812344 there are moments of loneliness when you are out in front
3812345 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3812346 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3812347 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3812348 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3812349 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3812350 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3812351 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3812352 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3812353 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3812354 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3812355 i also tried huffy and had the same issues but with an even more enormous file size
3812356 the rumors are there because people really wish it would happen
3812357 oh i would love to go back and do another serenity movie
3812358 that experience for me was the best acting experience of my life i had never really worked before and we were truly like a family it was an amazing and fun time for all of us i feel so blessed that we got to do the film at all

3812360 those rumors are just rumors and i dont think theyre going to stop no matter how many times i say no its not happening because somebody will say he said yes his eyes said yes his nose said yes there was a yes iness about him because people want it
3812361 at the same time im wondering whether the fault lies not with inconsistencies in the work of rockstars writing team but with the credulity of all of us liberty city is filled with self deluded characters like playboy x manny and brucie who present themselves one way only to be exposed by their behavior why do we take niko at face value is it just because hes our avatar remember we never hear nikos inner thoughts we just listen to his dialogue and see his actions as we carry them out according to my list of the five player roles we dont inhabit the role of niko but rather serve as his guardian angel maybe the gentleman doth protest too much maybe niko is deceiving himself as much as do the rest of the lowlifes he runs with maybe as much as he believes hes fatigued with death and killing hes actually drawn to it maybe we have all misunderstood niko bellic
3812362 transformers was a summer blockbuster its supposed to be completely retarded
3812363 i think nikos a sociopath the game left me no choice but to think of niko as scum i think the game designers wanted me to feel some sympathy for him no way i rejected what i felt was pressure from the game designers to grant niko emotional closure i let him run roughshod spitting on all who had cared for him because that was the only way i could make sense of everything the game had shown me through cutscenes and gameplay about niko bellic

3812378 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over

3812380 pcw was talking about expanding and having a show in south carolina
3812381 make no mistake the show will be here we have already sold about 300 tickets and reserved 10 rooms for the wrestlers at the security inn
3812382 i have offered them a booth at the festival to sell tickets i told them they can introduce the wrestlers on stage saturday and invite people to participate but were limited in what we can do
3812383 i hope theyre successful but we simply cant be responsible for their liability and marketing because we simply dont have those resources
3812384 we try to do this for the community based on the generosity of sponsors in our community were so lucky that people let us provide free events to the public
3812385 we cant abuse their generosity by promoting private events that raises money for themselves
3812386 theyll be staying in town eating here and buying gas
3812387 this is good clean family fun every show starts with the national anthem and a prayer there is no nudity and no cursing and its kid friendly and thats why i was hoping it would be better accepted
3812388 i can only imagine how much it would cost if i listed a wrestling match on our liability insurance policy

3812392 the bidders offer is does not reflect the long term value potential of the company
3812393 schaeffler would want to raise its bid to a point that continetal would drop its legal challenge

3812477 despite their the parents egregious denial of her danieals existence in life they now seek to profit by her tragic death that they caused
3812478 the potential beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters and the parents but the parents may be disqualified by a conviction or a civil finding of abandonment

3812482 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
3812483 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
3812484 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
3812485 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
3812486 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
3812487 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
3812488 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
3812489 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
3812490 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
3812491 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
3812492 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
3812493 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3812494 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3812495 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3812496 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3812497 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children
3812498 its been about eight years since weve have this kind of precipitation
3812499 thats one of the benefits of all this rain that york region has not issued any water advisories
3812500 its been more of a detriment to some of our roads
3812501 i dont think its put us behind in any one area
3812502 were outside as much as we can and everybody seems to be having a good time still
3812503 the development of the complete man the well rounded citizen
3812504 to be able to honour our teacher mrs kowaltschuk in her fight against cancer in such a way on such a beautiful day and hear the cheers of the students decked out in red and white and watch them begin the march back to st andrews college made me more proud to be a part of this school than i have ever been before
3812505 i consider myself more a player than a coach because i still have the passion of playing
3812506 i traveled two hours to get to school woke up at 5 a m and didnt get home until 9 p m
3812507 all i did was homework and play hockey so i was very committed
3812508 with this innovation patients no longer have to book check ups every three to four months at cardiac centres which often involves hours of driving and wait times to have their implanted devices tested
3812509 everything can now be done via internet and patients need only come into the hospital if the transmitted reports show a problem that cant be fixed remotely this means that if all is well patients potentially never have to come to the hospital concerning their implanted devices
3812510 this translates to significantly better patient care and gives patients increased peace of mind about their health and safety
3812511 since everything can be done remotely the new technology also decreases hospital wait times and frees doctors and nurses up so they can treat a greater number of patients in a shorter amount of time
3812512 with the new technology we will be able to provide a better quality of care and we hope that it will reduce the financial impact on the healthcare system at the same time
3812513 for the first time we have access to sophisticated defibrillators with complete wireless capability that can capture whats happening in the heart and completely monitor the device function automatically at home rather than requiring in clinic testing
3812514 york region is fortunate to have some of the best health care facilities in the country with leading practitioners and technologies in a variety of clinical areas
3812515 however we cannot be complacent we must continuously invest in our facilities to ensure that they keep up with population changes as well as changes in technology
3812516 regional support is necessary to help bring to reality a new hospital in vaughan
3812517 vaughan is the largest city in canada without its own hospital while vaughan residents can at present get excellent care at area hospitals in surrounding communities population growth pressures across the region make this situation unsustainable funding from york region for our projects is paramount for the benefit of the regional community
3812518 all of the communities in york region are facing incredible population growth the entire population of york region is expected to grow from 890 000 to 1 6 million by 2030
3812519 each york region hospital organization has capital plans that will help support this growth but we need the necessary local and provincial support to ensure that we can keep up with these changes
3812520 capital financial support for hospitals has always been a shared provincial community responsibility
3812521 regional council supporting our request will bring york region in line with the rest of the province and continue a program that has already helped area hospitals grow to meet the changing needs of the community

3812534 this will help to improve walking and cycling conditions in york region and encourage more people to walk and cycle more often and connect to our public transit system

3812557 were to the point where we need every possible resource renewables demand response and energy efficiency nuclear clean coal you name it we need it
3812558 and we especially need the transmission lines that will bring the power generated by these new resources to consumers

3812594 and where would the money for this nationalized health insurance industry come from
3812595 he government accountability office said 72 percent of all foreign corporations and about 57 percent of u s companies doing business in the united states paid no federal income taxes for at least one year between 1998 and 2005
3812596 the report did not name any companies the gao said corporations escaped paying federal income taxes for a variety of reasons including operating losses tax credits and an ability to use transactions within the company to shift income to low tax countries
3812597 but if you tax corporations they wont be able to make money the value of their stock will drop and theyll be forced to out source labor to stay competitive further hurting the economy blah blah blah

3812609 the perspective on mental illness as something that can be treated is a pretty new western concept for many of our clients so it becomes a family secret and people dont seek help until it gets out of control or really really bad
3812610 and so if we dont integrate the understandings physicians will sometimes look at it as just a physical problem and miss the psychological mental health implications of what people are saying
3812611 the most important thing is respecting where they are at and not discounting their beliefs but bringing the best package of services we can offer to that individual

3812730 kondisi ini yang membuat kami kadang dituduh berlama lama memegang dana tunjangan profesi padahal kami siap memberikan tunjangan tersebut kapan pun sejauh guru guru tersebut memenuhi syarat mendapatkannya kami tak berani menahan dana tunjangan profesi karena ini sepenuhnya milik guru guru bersertifikat

3812796 yes because the band has been around for eleventy billion years and i did not as you apparently did spend the majority of them under a rock
3812797 dont you see how it is spelled it is lynyrd not leonard
3812798 that guy is actually called kid rock its not like where there is no leonard

3812807 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3812808 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3812809 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3812810 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3812811 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3812812 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3812813 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3812814 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3812815 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3812816 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3812821 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3812822 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3812823 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3812824 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3812825 residents are contacting me because fewer dentists are taking on nhs patients locally and in some cases we have been successful in helping them get treatment i continue to raise this matter with the pct and will ensure that local access to nhs dentists is given priority within the ongoing strategic review of nhs services in billericay

3812834 isnt this the same day that republicans would be endangering the delivery of social security checks because of their misguided attempts to promote energy policies that will do nothing to deal with the short term problems facing the country

3812870 akin having no qualms about opposing the majority of church fathers which as we have seen in an earlier footnote was a view the fathers held against the greek philosophers who were advocating an evolutionary origin to the universe nor any qualm about opposing the consensus of medieval theologians who adopted the patristic consensus he summarily dismisses all of them for one statement in the catechism a statement which we have seen he totally distorts to his own liking as well as failing to cite even one corroborating source to back up his interpretation
3812871 look i have jesus in my heart i want to bring many others to jesus here is the apostle of divine love jesus give me your light throughout my long way
3812872 washington cns the u s bishops have voted to ask the vatican to approve a small change in the u s catholic catechism for adults to clarify church teaching on gods covenant with the jewish people
3812873 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
3812874 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
3812875 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross
3812876 might be understood to imply that one of the former covenants imparts salvation without the mediation of christ whom christians believe to be the universal savior of all people
3812877 the catechism is not the place where you work out difficult theological problems
3812878 are in a real relationship with god based on a covenant that has never been revoked
3812879 all covenants with israel find fulfillment in christ who is the savior of all
3812880 it is also the churchs understanding that the full incorporation of israel into the saving covenant of christ may be the fruit of the end times may not happen until the end of history

3812937 we recognise that uncertainty will remain on bookings for summer 2009 until the end of 2008 early 2009 and after a 40 percent bounce over the last month think that some profit taking is possible

3812998 in this case the 2 300 year old solar observatory at chankillo is the earliest such structure identified and unlike all other sites contains alignments that cover the entire solar year it predates the european conquests by 1 800 years and even precedes by about 500 years the monuments of similar purpose constructed by the mayans in central america
3812999 focusing on the andes and the incan empire we have known for decades from archeological artifacts and documents that they practiced what is called solar horizon astronomy which uses the rising and setting positions of the sun in the horizon to determine the time of the year
3813000 we knew that inca practices of astronomy were very sophisticated and that they used buildings as a form of
3813001 since the 19th century there was speculation that the 13 tower array could be solar or lunar demarcation but no one followed up on it
3813002 i am used to being disappointed when visiting places people claim to be ancient astronomical observatories
3813003 since everything must point somewhere and there are a great many promising astronomical targets the evidence when you look at it objectively turns out all too often to be completely unconvincing
3813004 chankillo on the other hand provided a complete set of horizon markers the thirteen towers and two unique and indisputable observation points
3813005 the fact that as seen from these two points the towers just span the solar rising and setting arcs provides the clearest possible indication that they were built specifically to facilitate sunrise and sunset observations throughout the seasonal year
3813006 chankillo reflects well developed astronomical principles which suggests the original forms of astronomy must be quite older
3813007 this study brings a new significance to an old site
3813008 it is a wonderful discovery and an important milestone in andean observations of this site that people have been arguing over for a hundred years
3813009 chankillo is one of the most exciting archaeoastronomical sites i have come across
3813010 it seems extraordinary that an ancient astronomical device as clear as this could have remained undiscovered for so long

3813019 here is this field and here is the consensus opinion on question x so believe it
3813020 the ipcc assesses the scientific technical and socio economic information relevant for understanding the risk of man made climate change its regular reports are based mainly on peer reviewed and published scientific and technical literature the assessments are produced by three working groups which bring together hundreds of leading experts from around the world the reports thus represent the most authoritative global scientific consensus on climate change
3813021 does human activity have a significant impact on climate change
3813022 2 no climate model includes the effect of clouds because computers need to be roughly six orders of magnitude more powerful to do so
3813023 as can be inferred from the description of the current climate models gathered by amip amip 1995 gates et al 1999 the cloud schemes presently in use in the different modelling centres vary greatly in terms of complexity consistency and comprehensiveness however there is a definite tendency toward a more consistent treatment of the clouds in climate models the more widespread use of a prognostic equation for cloud water serves as a unifying framework coupling together the different aspects of the cloud physics as noted in the sar the evolution of the cloud schemes in the different climate models has continued since then
3813024 yeah but if some idiot didnt stick the match under it it still wouldnt have started boiling
3813025 if one match isnt significant then why should it matter at all if we add one two or twelve more matches before the first one has burned out
3813026 well co2 is definitely growing due to the lack of scrubbers but we have this other group some place that says that it increasing at only 1 over what the scrubbers can deal with might not really be that big of a problem hello hello damn wonder why they arent responding anymore
3813027 yeah but if some idiot didnt stick the match under it it still wouldnt have started boiling
3813028 if one match isnt significant then why should it matter at all if we add one two or twelve more matches before the first one has burned out
3813029 well co2 is definitely growing due to the lack of scrubbers but we have this other group some place that says that it increasing at only 1 over what the scrubbers can deal with might not really be that big of a problem hello hello damn wonder why they arent responding anymore

3813060 i have to disagree consider a physics student doing research in relativity who believes there is something fundamentally wrong with general relativity understanding is required belief is not
3813061 people hold all sorts of opinions different from the department in which they graduate
3813062 well hes not hurting anyone with his research and its important not to inadvertantly cut off healthy discussion
3813063 i earned my doctorate by dint of my research properly presented published and defended by my completion of required coursework passing qualifying exams all that crap swearing allegiance to particular beliefs is absolutely not a requirement
3813064 the fact that he has a ph d from a legitimate science department as a springboard
3813065 we also discuss the intersection of those sorts of ideas with christianity

3813078 dont trust any fundie internet troll who doesnt even use the king james bible
3813079 we disown this creationist clown and refuse to recognize the ph d we mistakenly granted to him his actions and words subsequent to the granting of his degree reflect a profound ignorance if not outright hostility towards science and basic principles of honesty
3813080 oh yeah that guys completely nuts but he can operate the sifters ok
3813081 this ph d was given with the expectation that you would not abuse the title in order to attack and mock the principles which give the title meaning you abused the trust we placed in you if you feel betrayed join the club we have no doubt that you will find some way to find a silver lining in all of this perhaps by appealing to the same religious dogma which allows you to believe that the earth is 6 000 years old enjoy
3813082 what does it mean to believe something if not to believe that it is true this is much like my preferred answer when a fundamentalist asks me if i believe in evolution to that i say i dont believe in anything in the way that they believe in things
3813083 a large part of what gives science the credibility it has is that science departments dont institutionalize a belief system
3813084 no im not the creationist from uri written up in the new york times
3813085 i swear the geosciences faculty that gave me my degree arent crazy
3813086 so consider the organizations in our society that do institutionalize a belief system
3813087 the study of biology yields some conclusions but i hope they never become definitional
3813088 what objective methods do you propose to reject a qualified candidate based on their philosophy
3813089 as has been pointed out by others there is no such thing as a code of ethics or oath of office for scientists as there is for doctors and lawyers
3813090 surely most here can immediate recognize how that can be abused
3813091 its the only really relevant thing any university simply cannot act on subjective grounds otherwise they open themeselves up to lawsuits
3813092 if you set up a system where any faculty member can subjectively smear a grad student they can and they will if that graduate student slights them in some way
3813093 youre an idiot to think that it wouldnt happen as it has happened many times
3813094 at no time did the university or faculty of uri express to me how i was to disseminate the information i learned while a student at uri as such the arbitrary decision by the university to revoke my degree is obviously based entirely on subjective grounds and is in violation of my free speech rights
3813095 why dont you go ask the legal dept of your supposed alma matter and ask them if they agree with your assesment
3813096 i cant wait for a true scientist to infiltrate liberty university and sneak in some
3813097 censor someone for a belief system as long as it does not affect their work science is an open enterprise to anyone who practices it
3813098 i say that you cannot legitimately earn an advanced degree in geology and at the same time hold a belief contrary to all the evidence and that the only way you can accomplish it is by basically lying to yourself and your committee throughout the process
3813099 if these premises are true then this evidence supports this hypothesis
3813100 as i have said repeatedly this isnt about what someone believes its about the quality of the arguments that they make for specific positions in science marcus ross makes bad incompetent arguments or no arguments at all for a 6000 year old earth

3813105 an estimated 3 of patients 30 000 people and 60 000 eyes in 2001 will have lasting complications such as double vision and halos or starbursts around lights at night some will have dry eyes or wont be able to read easily
3813106 the bottom line is that laser eye surgery lasik does absolutely nothing to treat the cause of your vision loss and is 100 percent guaranteed to make your vision worse over time please trust me on this one as i am convinced that it is true
3813107 while the procedure is quick in itself it is likely to lead to at least six months of impaired vision and significant discomfort at the end of which only one eye may have normal sight
3813108 then there are the surgical disasters that can happen you can visit vision surgery rehab network to review some of the horror stories the site is devoted to focusing attention on the unique problems faced by those who have undergone unsuccessful lasik and other eye surgeries

3813133 thats what he has to do stay on sometimes hes just not there hes somewhere else its time to play someone else when that happens and that may happen this year we could be playing him and its not his day we need to make a move and play someone else and he doesnt need to get all upset about it get ready the next time if its his day were in good shape
3813134 i told them after practice im going to get off my fat ass and start getting every ounce of energy and every ounce of talent out of them ive kind of let them down in that case and im not going to do that anymore i think because i did that today i got more out of them

3813159 is there any backlash with your team due to the brett favre situation presumably with qb jeff garcia
3813160 i dont think there is garcia is a great competitor and the team has remained focused a team doesnt finish a ball game with zero penalties referring to saturdays pre season win over the dolphins if its not focused on the task ahead
3813161 are you going to pay jeff garcia more money before allen can reply i think you should in order to keep him happy oil his hiney tell him how much you love him say hello to his wife and give him a little more money

3813169 we defended well as a unit and restricted them to a few long range shots and not much else
3813170 i thought we had a chance it wasnt their strongest side we felt we could give them a game and get a result
3813171 it didnt turn out that way and the lads are disappointed

3813183 the top advertisers already get that cables got a co lead role in their tv plans but i think whats shining a light on the growth of iconic programming makes it all a stronger play when they are getting their sales force pumped up for the coverage and the overall power of the brand
3813184 this years weak economy has resulted in extremely volatile ad markets with major advertisers scrambling to allocate budgets where they will get the most bang for the buck

3813187 theyre going to target dwight howard and theyre going to target carmelo anthony
3813188 the most important thing for us will be to keep our composure
3813189 they play with his passion with his dignity with his toughness and i have just loads of respect for him when we lost to him we just didnt play well and after the ballgame we could have made all sorts of excuses but i would never not dignify his great accomplishment he is truly a great friend but in saying that i want to turn the tables on him thursday well be ready were going to be a different team than we were then
3813190 weve had to live for two years with people saying we cant defend or we cant do this
3813191 and in that game we learned the finality of what it is if youre not at your best and theres an atonement for that its like a cleansing and as far as our pursuit of the gold medal thats part of the process
3813192 barbosa his whole purpose is to score and spanoulis seems to be more of a setup guard who will score more of a combo but he gets them into the offense quite a bit so itll be a little different
3813193 i will enjoy it you know he is a great player and he will come with his best for me
3813194 if i tell my guys were going to play a certain amount of zone its almost like saying our man to man is not good defense just psychologically
3813195 they may not be good against our man and over the years the championship teams ive had have made teams adjust to them and if youre constantly adjusting to who you play then youve got to be careful you never know who you are but again zone is part of our repertoire and im not saying were not going to use it im just saying i dont know how many minutes well use it
3813196 hes a slashing guy and nobody really talks about him but hes good
3813197 but if hes like carlos delfino a guy who if he makes his first two shots hes on if he misses youve got him

3813211 i just missed the shuttle van and i dont want to wait till 7 15
3813212 what happened on the night of august 7 is beyond comprehension
3813213 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
3813214 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3813215 nevertheless it was still possible to find a political solution clearly the only way to solve the south ossetian problem on that basis is through peaceful means the georgian leadership flouted this key principle
3813216 the georgian government and its supporters should rethink their position
3813217 of course peace in the caucasus is in everyones interest but it is simply common sense to recognize that russia is rooted there by common geography and centuries of history russia is not seeking territorial expansion but it has legitimate interests in this region
3813218 a lesson from recent events is that geopolitical games are dangerous anywhere not just in the caucasus
3813219 already thousands of people have died tens of thousands have been turned into refugees and towns and villages lie in ruins nothing can justify this loss of life and destruction it is a warning to all
3813220 you come out and look forward to competing and helping your team but i also took it as a way to get into the weight room and get stronger and to learn from the veterans about what it takes to play at this level so i took it as more of an advantage than a disadvantage
3813221 so im just going to keep working hard in the classroom and i shouldnt have a problem with getting that year back
3813222 ive been here going on three years and this is the fullest that ive seen our meeting room
3813223 weve actually had to add more chairs to our room i think were 16 or 17 deep now were deep and were talented but weve still got to grow as a unit because we got to put that to use
3813224 things that we talk about every day at practice are to go out be fundamentally sound and hustle and run to the ball
3813225 we want to be able to go sideline to sideline all day long
3813226 were still doing the same things we were doing with former defensive coordinator chuck pagano but its just more simplified they just let us play ball thats it all we want to be able to do is go out there and line out and be able to go sideline to sideline
3813227 it allows us just to line up and play ball just go all out instead of having to blitz and do all that so its more of an advantage for us as a d line just to get off the ball and attack
3813228 attention to detail is a hallmark of the think tank line and this new rolling model is no exception little brother to the airport international it meets international carry on size requirements and features the lines exceptional security features these include a front cable and lock to secure a laptop and a back cable and lock to secure the bag to a fixed object despite its cabin ready dimensions the bag has more than enough room for multiple slr bodies and lenses even up to 400mm a seam sealed rain cover keeps everything dry when not high
3813229 think tank photos modular belt system is tailor made for photographers who need instant access to multiple lenses and strobes any combination of five different pouch designs from single strobe to dual zoom can be hooked onto the belt skin refers to the fact that the pouches are unpadded to reduce bulk and improve access when youre shooting
3813230 when im out on the west coast i dont think about it much but when im with the guys we start talking about baseball
3813231 jimmy rice and i talk about golf were golfers when we hook up we take on all comers
3813232 i cant remember two rookies coming on the same team and having that type of impact
3813233 obviously we helped the club and had jimmy not gotten hit by vern ruhle by a pitch that broke a bone in his wrist in late september we wouldve had him in the world series we might not have had to wait until 2004
3813234 in 78 we won 99 games and didnt make the playoffs
3813235 thats a lot of wins not to make the playoffs but thats the way it was we could never get over the hump the yankees were our nemesis in those days and they were just one better than us
3813236 so that made 2004 that much sweeter for the fans
3813237 if they lose a tough game well get them tomorrow it wasnt like that before it was life or death every game now the people have already won so theyre relaxed theyre still intense but theyre relaxed
3813238 it certainly looks like the real deal how does this look like the real deal it looks like a cell

3813250 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3813251 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3813252 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3813253 we believe that despite the difficult economic times market share gains and price stability are leading to positive same store sales this quarter for best buy
3813254 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3813255 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3813256 we however note apple products typically carry low margins and strong initial sales could negatively impact best buys gross margin
3813257 while this does strengthen an important relationship with apple we remain cautious on consumer electronics heading into 2009 as slowing flat panel cycle pressured by falling price points mass competition and weaker consumer discretionary spending is likely to pressure specialty players

3813277 the new web generation is not application driven or a change in our habits it seems to be the preferred data formats and new integration methodology that has a profound effect on the web by leveraging applications usability and scalability
3813278 we did not change the web when we first introduced instant messaging or email clients it was the html code on http protocol which let everyone communicate on the web and today it is not the emergence of blogging or social networking sites that shape the new web it is more likely to be the xml feed in our applications which allows real time data integration and collaboration on a global scale and creates a new generation of web products and services

3813285 bersandarlah kita pada ke maha besaran ke maha gagahan ke maha kuasaannya ke maha perkasaannya agar hal itu bisa terjadi
3813286 saya tidak mengajarkan untuk mempelajari mukjijat karena bukan sunnah rassul tidak ada perintah untuk mempelajarinya karena bukan untuk dipelajari mukjijat hanya pertolongan allah semata untuk para nabi dan rassul mungkin bagi manusia semacam kita ada nama lain ulama terkadang menyebutnya kharamah
3813287 ya karena kita telah aqrab juga telah berada dalam tahapan marifat
3813288 tentu asalkan hati kita ikhlas dan berada dalam kasih sayangnya meskipun orang tadi tidak sepintar ki chantulo membaca basmallah pun tidak terlalu lancar tetapi karena hatinya bening bisa terjadi pertolongan allah datang tanpa diduga sebab hancurnya setiap amalan dan hasil ibadah kita akibat tercemarinya hati
3813289 bukankah ketika kita telah berbuat baik menjadi sebuah catatan amal lalu catatan amal tadi bisa tercoreng karena dalam hati timbul ria dan takabur
3813290 bukankah dalam hadistnya kanjeng nabi menjelaskan pada suatu ketika islam itu hanya tinggal namanya alquran tinggal tulisannya
3813291 banyak orang memahami ajaran islam bahkan pasih membaca alquran tetapi prilakunya menyimpang
3813292 ya dijadikan alat untuk berkuasa dan menguasai serta membodohi rakyat
3813293 hentikan ki chantulo saya tidak mengharuskan menuduh orang lain seperti yang diuraikan di atas jika demikian berarti jiwa dan hati kita pun sudah tercemari dengan rasa benci dan berburuk sangka biarlah allah yang menilai baik dan buruknya seseorang bukankah dalam setiap diri manusia ada malaikat pencatat amal kebaikan dan kejelekan
3813294 mana mungkin orang bisa menapaki marifat jika hati belumlah bening
3813295 pantas saya belumlah sampai pada tahapan marifat jiwa saya terkadang terusik keadaan dan situasi yang menurut penilaian saya jelek padahal jelek itu bukan menurut pribadi juga berdasarkan aturan agama yang saya anut
3813296 menurunkan penilaian jelek pada orang lain karena jiwa kita sedang disisipi perasaan merasa paling benar
3813297 karena kita sedang merasa paling benar akan selalu menganggap orang lain salah selalu saja ingin mencela mencercerca memaki dan melontarkan ejekan padahal kebenaran yang ada dalam diri manusia bersipat nisbi kebenaran mutlak hanyalah milik allah seandainya kita selalu menganggap diri paling benar maka akan lupa instrospeksi diri meski prilaku kita sudah jelas sangat salah menurut banyak orang
3813298 benar sehingga hal itu jika diperturutkan akan membunuh kehormatan sendiri kita akan dibuatnya tidak berdaya karena merasa selalu benar saat orang lain meluruskan dan mengingatkan sangat sulit diterima perlahan orang akan menjauh jika dia berkuasa dan memiliki pengaruh akan menggunjingnya dibelakang
3813299 mengapa saya sulit menahan dan mengendalikan jiwa yang bergolak ketika tidak setuju dan benci akan penyimpangan terutama dari

3813320 a small group of us met to discuss the forum and we were unanimous that it should have been allowed to proceed there are valid reasons for such a forum
3813321 as was emphasised to us by international islamic university constitutional law expert dr abdul aziz bari and hanifah maidin the head of pas legal bureau article 121 1a of the federal constitution when passed had not envisaged the circumstances that could arise for example the impact on people of other faiths embracing islam
3813322 we dont see the forum as non muslims encroaching into theological matters the underpinning reason was for the legal technical and procedural lacuna created by article 121 1a to be ironed out in earnestness and intellectual integrity
3813323 take the case of subashini and saravanan who were married under civil law and he later on embraced islam
3813324 if the non converting spouse does not use the law reform marriage and divorce act to dissolve the marriage what happens these are long standing issues that the authorities should have ironed out long ago instead every time a case like this raises its ugly head it is muslims and islam that get bashed
3813325 thats why dr mehrun siraj who was cut short from talking by the protesters who wanted the forum to end asked for reform
3813326 we thought that after the march election we had proven that we could manage dissent intellectually and discuss issues without getting emotional
3813327 we regret saturdays incident there are some issues that should be discussed behind closed doors but this was just to plug the loopholes
3813328 online communities are all about the exchange of information this makes them highly susceptible to spam scams and other content of an undesirable nature if you dont keep on top of this kind of content your online community will suffer and ultimately fail
3813329 esse crescimento econ mico teve muito pouco efeito sobre investimentos ou gera o de emprego e portanto sobre a redu o da pobreza

3813338 det finns uppgifter som visar att ryssland skickat frivilliga fr n nordossetien
3813339 weve been clear about the current threat for the last six months the threat is high in certain parts of northern ireland
3813340 but theyre badly disrupted theyre marginalised theyre fighting with each other so they are not at the same level and they dont have the capacity in our judgement to carry out an outrage on the scale of omagh
3813341 but they still pose a threat to the public and to the police
3813342 their focus is clear they are determined to kill a police officer they are focused on killing a police officer and that is where our efforts are going
3813343 my horse eats an apple fritter every morning and has horrid feet do you think that may be the reason
3813344 we do have lcdui slated for a future maintenance release and again we did state that the timeframe is at least one month out we cant share any more information than that
3813345 the resolution may vary depending on the problem generally the vendor is expected to either bring the device into compliance or stop shipping it obviously if the device reached customers already the bug cannot be instantly fixed the vendor will have to work with sun to work out the plan
3813346 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months

3813350 the task team expressed the view that the current issues on the ground should be taken into account as it clear that there are some elements of dissatisfaction which cannot be ignored with regards to re integration
3813351 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3813352 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3813353 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3813354 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3813355 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3813356 what we want to do is make the experience of remembering as simple as possible
3813357 to hear the devastation and just the fear that was instilled in them the worry to the families and the worry about facing unemployment
3813358 that was probably the most important thing to give them the chance to talk in a safe place about what happened with them
3813359 that doesnt mean that we only investigate those employers but we give priority to those because they are critical infrastructure
3813360 everything required by law and everything allowed by the law to prevent the hiring of undocumented workers
3813361 were only allowed to look at so many documents there is a new system called e verify to make sure they are who they say they are but were only allowed to look at the documents they give us and if at face value they appear to be legitimate thats all were able to do
3813362 we reject a lot of people for false documents a lot of them we are able to reject on their face value
3813363 but some are so perfect the forgeries are so perfect its very very difficult to tell
3813364 were trying to hire the best people we can get
3813365 a lot of these applicants come to us from the employment security commission
3813366 we developed a connection with ice in charlotte on mills manufacturing i am grateful for their follow through and will continue to press this issue
3813367 it is wrong that this company has so flagrantly ignored immigration law and the importance of employing american workers
3813368 speaks to a true lack of understanding of the issue
3813369 to cart them away in a bus is an injustice and to put it under the fa ade of homeland security is a lie
3813370 hell surround himself with great people congress does everything anyway he has really good judgment
3813371 i am not sure that i approve of the law of gravity in fact im not sure i agree with it at all what kind of a law would cause people to fall off objects
3813372 chris brauns has done a magnificent job in helping us understand the true nature of biblical forgiveness every christian will profit from reading and applying this book
3813373 there is too much credit card debt holders of credit cards should have to up a deposit before they can use their cards like the renter of an apartment puts up security no credit card borrowing should be allowed naturally that would cut consumption way down but that is what is needed
3813374 if youre not taking time to get a check up on your voice as often as you get your paycheck you run the risk of not having either
3813375 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
3813376 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp

3813385 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3813386 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3813387 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3813388 one of the players decided he would just hop in his car and take off with it and that was the last time i saw it
3813389 it was nice to get one over marist but all we wanted was to have it for saturday night and give it back on sunday
3813390 quite a few of the players and management actually hired a bus and rode all the way out to msp clubrooms on sunday but nobody was there so they came back
3813391 we tried to do the right thing after doing the wrong thing we know there was an agreement but we thought wed just get one over them
3813392 we thought seeing as they were having it for the first six months cant we just have it for tonight
3813393 we saw the funny side of it but obviously marist havent
3813394 norths fronted with an apology because they didnt know where it was
3813395 were pretty disappointed really our club captain made an agreement with the norths guysm we thought that was done on the basis of a handshake and we were dealing with reputable people but it hasnt really transpired

3813399 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3813400 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf
3813401 is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3813402 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3813403 this creates questions about where we are heading i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3813404 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3813405 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year
3813406 it is not a special board meeting it is a normal one which has already been scheduled
3813407 the meetings with the international cricket council icc delegation and the whole issue of whether to send a team or not will be discussed by the board
3813408 it is a very logical thing to do and hopefully it will assuage concerns of leading players and make up their minds to come here
3813409 as a former australian test player a coach and someone who lives in pakistan he is in a unique position to give his perspective to those stakeholders
3813410 i hope the icc addresses the players concerns adequately and not only convinces me but also players who have shown concerns over playing in pakistan
3813411 i have come to pakistan with an open mind and a great deal of thought has been put on the issues relating to security so i will get back and brief the players about the tour

3813418 i enjoyed it as a kid playing it through high school but trying to crack the elite level of union is another story
3813419 whether id get bored at club level before i even put a test jumper on thats even if i get a chance to do it
3813420 theres always those possibilities of getting bored at the club level and not enjoying it not playing your best footy it could be a long road
3813421 im not saying its not the case but its that indicated to me that thats a possibility
3813422 weve been showing channels in widescreen for some years and weve been progressively converting them to widescreen
3813423 sky sport 3 will be going to widescreen soon and if someone has a widescreen or a high definition screen theres no problem
3813424 we blamed it on my daughter who had the control thinking she had pushed the wrong button
3813425 the whole room went silent we were dumbfounded i couldnt believe it could happen right at that time
3813426 i dont think it is a good thing for new zealand racing
3813427 i know prizemoney is one thing but it is very difficult to differentiate between an auckland cup and a wellington cup when the only difference is prizemoney
3813428 they pretty much draw the same fields and you could probably make a case for saying the wellington cup was stronger with horses like pasta post running in it this year
3813429 people said it wasnt a strong field last december but im pretty sure spin around proved it was overkaast second finished second in the new zealand oaks last year and resolution third was a close up fifth in the queensland derby and went on to be three times group one placed this year
3813430 i cant see how they can look at the last running of the avondale cup and say it should be downgraded i would have thought it definitely held its ground last year
3813431 its a big of slap in the face for the club and the sponsor i hope we can turn it around
3813432 the club doesnt have a particular view but we have asked the graded stakes committee whether they see a 3200m race as a logical lead up to the auckland cup
3813433 we havent had a reply yet but perhaps the downgrade tells us something
3813434 its not a matter of possession its how you use the possession that counts you have to be really effective with the ball in hand because of the sanctions at the breakdown
3813435 you dont want to get caught at the breakdown too often in your own territory because you are likely to have a free kick against you and then you hand momentum to the other team
3813436 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3813437 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3813438 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3813439 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas

3813490 we didnt like the result but after we settled down i felt like we played well
3813491 we executed but couldnt finish it was like doing everything you need to in basketball to get a layup and then missing the layup the points didnt indicate that it was close but we felt like we were in every rally

3813516 as most of you know i am not a president bush fan nor have i ever been but this is not about bush it is about us as americans and it seems to hit the mark the other day i was reading newsweekmagazine and came across some poll data i found rather hard to believe it must be true given the source right the newsweek poll alleges that 67 percent of americans are unhappy with the direction the country is headed and 69 percent of the country is unhappy with the performance of the president in essence 2 3 of the citizenry just aint happy and want a change so being the knuckle dragger i am i started thinking what are we so unhappy about

3813528 i think these business owners are mis characterizing whats going on
3813529 there is a remote chance that we have some sort of rogue sales person but i think that its more likely its just a business owner thats pissed off about reviews on his page
3813530 i didnt receive a phone call from yelp until i received a negative review
3813531 a week after i received a negative review a sales person contacted me and she said

3813600 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3813601 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3813602 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3813603 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3813604 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3813605 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3813606 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3813607 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3813608 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3813609 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3813610 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3813611 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3813612 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3813613 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas
3813614 the control room received 249 calls seeking information about traffic blocks
3813615 the object oriented approach is a novel way of systems thinking that allows for analysis of complex systems and for design of suitable software systems instead of thinking about processes the users of object oriented information systems think in term of objects and their behaviour

3813627 in the past few months our scientists have been able to achieve significant ethanol percentages in fermentation and improve the yield of ethanol from biomass additionally in our work with farmers and agricultural equipment manufacturers we had a very successful harvest of corn cobs last fall and anticipate further advances during an expanded harvest this fall

3813673 palestinians still harbor animosity towards jews and that emerges on occasion in violence and indiscriminate terror the price of a unified jerusalem is to live with that threat and to prepare for it at all times better that kind of threat than the danger that would come with a unilateral withdrawal such a move would permit palestinian terror cells to operate close to the citys ancient walls with impunity lobbing rockets and directing sniper fire into all of the citys neighborhoods and public spaces this would effectively destroy israels policy of ensuring open access to the holy sites of all faiths those who wish to see jerusalem remain an open city never again divided by barbed wire and checkpoints must recognize that will be the case only so long as jerusalem remains governed by israel

3813686 to take photographs means to recognize simultaneously and within a fraction of a second both the fact itself and the rigorous organization of visually perceived forms that give it meaning it is putting ones head ones eye and ones heart on the same axis
3813687 rather than observing the world the media seem to be intrinsically involved in its creation

3813695 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3813696 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3813697 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3813698 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3813699 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3813700 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund
3813701 hey rick we think your low fee and very low touch service model is a disservice to investors we would like to ask you to increase the support you offer your clients
3813702 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3813703 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3813704 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
3813705 we realize that there are many small form factor boards in the market
3813706 but we believe the new nano 8044 stands out from the crowd it is an off the shelf solution that can readily address todays need for applications that require a much smaller board size than the existing mini itx form factors and it provides a truly fanless configuration
3813707 the intel atom processor provides a fanless compact solution that meets the requirements of the market segments portwell serves
3813708 we have taken advantage of this technology to furnish a product that reduces the size of the mini itx by half when you add in lvds panel support and longevity support for seven years the new nano 8044 is the perfect solution for any embedded application with panel display

3813725 esta reducci n del precio del petr leo sin duda debe reflejarse en el precio de los combustibles siempre que la bajada en d lares sea superior a la apreciaci n del euro

3813727 si vemos que efectivamente pasado un tiempo prudencial no se ven reflejados estos descensos en los mismos niveles en los que ten amos los precios del petr leo en euros hace unos meses l gicamente investigar amos el asunto se al al respecto
3813728 no se puede trasladar este porcentaje directamente al precio de los combustibles porque el precio del barril es una parte final del precio de los combustibles a la que se a aden los impuestos especiales por un lado y el iva por otro

3813737 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours

3813782 the prospect of two virginia governors giving speeches on successive nights at the convention is thought to be unlikely

3813784 its about honoring our veterans and the families of our veterans
3813785 and how to make us safer and move past the divisiveness and into the future
3813786 obamas vp pick will in fact hold gravitas in the areas of military national security issues

3813942 a focused consolidated review strengthens our ability to prevent anyone from profiting from insider information
3813943 while u s equity markets have always coordinated very well with each other to detect and investigate insider trading this agreement takes insider trading surveillance to a new level because it consolidates within finra and nyse regulation what used to be 11 discreet programs at each market center
3813944 as a result potential insider traders whether acting alone or in concert with others and regardless of where they trade in the u s will be more readily identified in this new more unified structure

3813949 comments attributed to an unnamed lobbyist working for chevron do not reflect our companys view regarding the ecuador case they were not approved by the company and will not be tolerated
3813950 we believe that the arrogance reflected in the anonymous comment accurately reflects a pervasive attitude within chevrons culture that led to the destruction of our precious rainforest
3813951 confirms how chevron cares little for the rule of law in any country where it might be held accountable be it ecuador or the u s
3813952 no court that actually hears the evidence appears to be good enough for chevron
3813953 not a single court in the world ever has agreed with chevrons interpretation of this release but that has not stopped chevrons lobbying team from playing judge and jury to the u s congress
3813954 viewing operations as a competitive differentiator versus the cost of doing business may sound daunting or at least overly ambitious
3813955 yet leading companies are proving that operational excellence is quickly becoming a prerequisite to sustainability especially during trying economic environments like we are seeing today so why not change the game why not leverage what you already have to win by offering our members an interactive exchange of the latest technology innovations best practices and customer success stories we can help them improve their operational efficiencies and in return maximize continuous improvement efforts drive costs out of their operations and lower total cost of ownership we are excited to welcome ed lange to share his insights on channeling the power of a companys entire extended enterprise into bottom line results when you merge this holistic thinking with daniel burrus guidance on timely adoption of the right enabling technologies you can look at operational performance with more promise than you ever thought possible

3813964 the new resource center helps the financial community gain a better understanding of the pending cost basis legislation and the various factors that affect a firms ability to properly handle cost basis calculations
3813965 based on proposed effective dates for cost basis reporting requirements brokers return preparers tax advisors and taxpayers will likely have less than two years to prepare
3813966 that isnt much time when you consider provisions of the legislation and the data and technology that firms will need to meet the requirements if firms are up to speed on the pending legislation and assess their readiness now they can prevent significant penalties for noncompliance down the road
3813967 with approximately 13 million visits made to downtown jacksonville last year clearly there is a demand for information about downtown in addition to connecting more than 200 businesses and retailers with workers and residents the site is also a resource for statistics development documents and legislation related to downtown jacksonville
3813968 our website is the one stop shop for downtown information the comprehensive directory and google mapping integration greatly improves access to information we know that people want to plan their entire visit downtown including parking dining and entertainment and the enhanced site will streamline that process
3813969 despite much excitement generated by recent advances in the knowledge of brain development and function the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of depression as well as its amelioration by ad treatment remain poorly understood
3813970 our data establish an essential cell autonomous role for trkb in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral sensitivity to antidepressive treatments and support the notion that impairment of the neurogenic niche is an etiological factor for refractory responses to antidepressive regimen in mice
3813971 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
3813972 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
3813973 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
3813974 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions
3813975 the dna is released out of the cell in less than a second
3813976 we dont know how eosinophils are capable of catapulting mitochondrial dna so quickly
3813977 niche modeling is a quick and straightforward approach to addressing problems that molecular data will eventually solve
3813978 also testing niche models in the present and past is the first step in making predictions about where species will move in the future given global warming scenarios
3813979 our findings support a role for nmdar dependent modulation of da neurons in cue induced relapse to drug seeking
3813980 our findings link nmdar signaling in da neurons with relapse behavior and provide a new rationale in the treatment of cocaine addiction specifically the selective activation of the glur1 subunit could potentially improve the outcome of any given exposure therapy
3813981 this is the missing child weve got to return her to her family
3813982 we know who has caylee and they are being watched
3813983 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
3813984 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
3813985 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
3813986 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses

3813995 if the fruits of productivity had been shared since the 1970s as they had been for the preceding quarter century the average full time worker would be earning 22 000 more than she or he is earning today 58 000 instead of 36 000
3813996 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3813997 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3813998 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3813999 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3814000 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3814001 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3814002 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3814003 im a magical owl i can tell when somethings the matter
3814004 its this dream i had last night i was killed in a laser battle with that robot from the other day i had my lightsaber but i wasnt able to defend myself with it
3814005 i did an internet search for dojos and i found a bunch
3814006 but im too embarassed to call them and ask if they have lightsaber lessons
3814007 i think i would be embarassed too but you know lightsabers come from space
3814008 lots of stuff comes from space meteors comets stars radiations whats the difference
3814009 if something comes from space chances are creatures that come from space will know how to use it right
3814010 but still i have no idea what youre getting at
3814011 i do not see there is anything wrong with it
3814012 you have to be sure that the performers and the song it is at the highest level
3814013 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect
3814014 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprint fireworks from the south to the north of the city
3814015 however because of poor visibility on the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3814016 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3814017 lin maokes voice didnt quite meet our standard the breadth and depth wasnt quite up to our standards so at last we decided from a sound perspective to use yang peiyi
3814018 the performer was lin miaoke but the sound was yang peiyi the reason is this one was for the benefit of the country the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression and lin miaoke meets our requirements in those aspects
3814019 however from a sound perspective our entire team unanimously agreed that yang peiyi fulfilled all of our requirements and more she is the best
3814020 the voice that lin miaoke heard was actually yang peiyis sound but she herself may not have realized this
3814021 it was played live at a rehearsal there were many different departments especially leaders from the politburo the central communist party leadership who all gave us their opinions that it must change so we had no choice
3814022 i think all of the listeners and audience should also understand this situation this is for the benefit of the country the national culture this is the face the image of the national music culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
3814023 i think this situation is fair for lin miaoke and yang peiyi its fair for both of them this is to say we have the best image and the best sound and we combined the two
3814024 why was the original girl not on stage because she was having dental work done
3814025 fake singing is not good but for the image and interests of the country fake singing now and again is acceptable
3814026 on a sidenote we should recognize that lip synching is in fact a form of art
3814027 what are you doing here of course with her uppity attitude
3814028 your right john she is mean but shes also fat and ugly too
3814029 i got on the phone and called my wife and made sure that they were safe
3814030 ironically we came through security at the same time we were thankful to be here and to be able to race
3814031 we really spent the last three days making sure that we were focused within ourselves not being afraid of failure and not letting that fear get in the way of having a good race
3814032 because the fear and the nerves can get to you and overcome your sense of ease that makes you row a lot better we just went out there trying to be focused and be loose
3814033 we just went through that over and over and over
3814034 we have a lot of confidence in our crew and we know from previous races this summer that we continually progress throughout the racing we seem to get better and better
3814035 i think we were all quite confident that this would be a much better performance than our heats
3814036 take me to the top dread take me to the top
3814037 what would jesus do oh yeah hed stiff this bitch so he didnt have to make payments anymore
3814038 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
3814039 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
3814040 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
3814041 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
3814042 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
3814043 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
3814044 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
3814045 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
3814046 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
3814047 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
3814048 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
3814049 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3814050 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3814051 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3814052 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3814053 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children
3814054 know that the lord he is god we are his people and the
3814055 this is the time to support the athletes who are there

3814074 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3814079 in terms of stability the mainframe is probably the best machine for transaction crunching we service 2 000 end users at any given time so having that kind of flexibility provides us with the ability to continue to support the health care environment while the mainframe processes applications and passes them down to other systems

3814192 sometimes people regard pregnancy as a time when you would expect protective and nurturing responses if someone was violent before you got pregnant they are likely to continue that while you are pregnant
3814193 the horrible reality is that pregnancy is one of those times when women are more at risk and family relationships are more at risk

3814223 there is a fair amount of seasonality in broadband so a dip in the second quarter is not altogether unexpected
3814224 however the magnitude of this decline suggests that the current economic environment is hampering the ability of service providers to garner new customers
3814225 this is not a situation where existing consumers are dropping broadband en masse rather the number of new subscribers is dwindling in lean economic times people are less inclined to assume an additional recurring monthly expense
3814226 in other words between 2007 and 2008 the median download speed increased by only four tenths of a megabit per second from 1 9 mbps to 2 3 mbps and the median upload speed barely changed from 371 to 435 kbps

3814233 while there was a marginal increase in the numbers of students that sat the higher paper in maths this year when you take into account the fact that more students sat the leaving certificate this year compared with last year the numbers are disappointing
3814234 for the past number of years the high failure rate in maths and the small numbers choosing to take higher level has made the headlines it is time to stop posturing and tackle the problem head on radical solutions must be introduced immediately
3814235 between 1999 and 2007 the irish medical devices workforce grew from 16 000 to over 24 000 representing nearly 10 per cent of irelands total manufacturing workforce this employment is sustained by the availability of highly skilled and educated workforce and is particularly reliant on skills in science and engineering subjects

3814238 however i want to urge them to remember that there is more to life than the leaving certificate the result they received today will not dictate the path their lives take

3814359 this content is kind of terrible do we really have to release this
3814360 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english
3814361 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3814362 the filmmakers have every right to do what they think is best in support of their movies but we have the right to do whats best for warner bros sometimes the pursuit of those interests results in a disagreement for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that
3814363 id like for us to find a way to release movies like
3814364 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3814365 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3814366 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3814367 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3814368 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3814369 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3814370 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3814371 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3814372 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3814373 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3814374 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3814375 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3814376 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3814377 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3814378 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3814379 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3814380 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3814381 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3814382 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3814383 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3814384 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3814385 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3814386 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3814393 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3814394 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3814395 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

3814406 all scripture is breathed out by god and profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness that the man of god may be competent equipped for every good work
3814407 men spoke from god as they were carried along by the holy spirit
3814408 inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that have been accomplished among us just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us it seemed good to me also having followed all things closely for some time past to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilis that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught
3814409 take to heart all the words by which i am warning you today that you may command them to your children that they may be careful to do all the words of this law for it is no empty word for you but your very life and by this word you shall live long in the land that you are going over the jordan to possess
3814410 if anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual he should acknowledge that what i am writing you us a command of the lord
3814411 so then you are no longer strangers and aliens but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of god built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets christ jesus himself being the cornerstone
3814412 for the word of god is living and active sharper than any two edged sword piercing to the division of soul and spirit of joints and of marrow and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the hearts
3814413 preach the word be ready in season and out of season reprove rebuke and exhort with complete patience and teaching
3814414 as for those who persist in sin rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear
3814415 this testimony is true therefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith
3814416 declare these things exhort and rebuke with all authority we must remember that gods purpose is to shape us into men and women who look more and more like jesus christ
3814417 have nothing to do with irreverent silly myths rather train yourself for godliness for while bodily training is of some value godliness is of value in every way as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come
3814418 do your best to present yourself to god as one approved a worker who has no need to be ashamed rightly handling the word of truth
3814419 put your cat out and turn your alarm on dumb arse
3814420 the message doesnt seem to be getting home to people lock it or lose it
3814421 please use whatever security you have and it may be as simple as locking the back door or remembering to activate the alarm when you go out
3814422 its simple things like people getting through insecure windows unlocked doors or reaching through catflaps its really basic stuff
3814423 theres absolutely no change to what were planning to do
3814424 ive got a hundred thousand people watching it if hes got 1000 people who dont want it dont like it then thats fine dont go
3814425 hes already boasting that hes going to ignore the council if he goes ahead he will be in contempt of court
3814426 these racing media will be okay because they do practical things like follow racing and give out honest commentary but the ones i deal with are the worst bunch of meerkats in the history of man and womankind
3814427 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3814428 we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3814429 we found that some gifted and talented students are not engaged in learning because they dont see school as being relevant to them
3814430 theyre thinking laterally and they think quickly theyre creative with their ideas and they are creative thinkers as well
3814431 their mind is going a thousand miles an hour and its just not being challenged
3814432 otherwise we just dont have anything to do with our ability i guess
3814433 international visitors know almost nothing theyre lucky if they understand the term maori and know what it means
3814434 new zealanders are generally less interested than internationals in maori experiences although a small number are very interested some new zealanders were very nervous about what they didnt know but feel they should know more so they feel embarrassed to go to these things
3814435 will visitors pay more for maori products not at this stage
3814436 there is a lot of build it and they will come attitude but tourist demand is a whole lot more complicated than that
3814437 its the one thing that sets us apart youll hear maori language spoken as part of everyday life
3814438 risk will exist all the way until the day you finish the job thats the reality of any project
3814439 the trick is to get the balance of risk right
3814440 weve put it forward as a preferred route for good reason
3814441 sometimes people regard pregnancy as a time when you would expect protective and nurturing responses if someone was violent before you got pregnant they are likely to continue that while you are pregnant
3814442 the horrible reality is that pregnancy is one of those times when women are more at risk and family relationships are more at risk
3814443 there is this sort of myth that being pregnant protects you and actually this is showing us that its not
3814444 that either means we have to be extremely efficient with our power use or we go backwards economically
3814445 if people want to know why their power prices are rising there is only one reason scarcity of supply
3814446 the last thing i heard is there was someone caught on camera and that was about it its not me so i dont have anything to worry about i dont know who it is i was working
3814447 why does everyone think its me its not me my hair was too long i work too much to have done that
3814448 its not him i watched the footage last night ill tell you exactly whats happened his friend has given his name theyre always playing silly buggers
3814449 knows when and how to drop clues to keep readers at her mercy
3814450 it depends on the case at hand and the quality of evidence gathered we need accurate evidence that will stand up in court before we progress the investigation sometimes they do take a long time because we have to get it right
3814451 we blamed it on my daughter who had the control thinking she had pushed the wrong button
3814452 the whole room went silent we were dumbfounded i couldnt believe it could happen right at that time
3814453 as we were louise nicholas publisher it didnt seem to be appropriate to also be mr rickards publisher
3814454 these things are not just made up the format of a curse or spell must be based on real examples from the classical period and reflect the beliefs of the practitioners
3814455 in their many guises magic and witchcraft have been important features of most societies whether approved of or feared by non practitioners
3814456 the questions that need to be asked of any tertiary education are what are they doing to create good citizens and what are they doing to ensure the skills are transferable
3814457 not a run of the mill low point in the economic cycle
3814458 while i have full confidence that new zealand will start growing again later this year no one should expect that once growth returns the world will keep ticking along as it has for the past two decades
3814459 im very keen to see the results of the issue with the hope that the government will move forward
3814460 i have heard comments like while its law i will drink and drive that tells me while we have any limits people will continue
3814461 but i think we are really waiting on more information before making a judgment call
3814462 ideally we want to see more studies to see if it is going to be of benefit as people suspect it might be

3814464 breast cancer is a serious disease that affects many island women and their families
3814465 this investment will help to ensure that women have access to the latest technological advancement in breast cancer detection our government has been firm in our commitment to investing in health care for islanders and this new equipment will significantly enhance the services provided at the prince county hospital
3814466 the move to digital mammography from traditional film based mammography will improve patient care and help to reduce patient wait times for breast cancer screening
3814467 this new technology allows physicians to send images electronically to other professionals for their consideration which will potentially reduce the wait time between when a mammogram is performed and when it is read by an expert
3814468 we are delighted that digital mammography will soon become a reality here at prince county hospital
3814469 the genuine interest in this campaign has been overwhelming and we are so thankful to the many groups organizations and individuals who have already supported this great cause without a doubt having access to this new technology is extremely important for women as we look to a future where cancer is caught and treated earlier

3814849 contemplative prayer is the movement of becoming acquainted experientially with god beyond the confines of rational dialogue it is deeply embedded in the gospel and in the christian tradition jesus suggestion about how to pray is a formula for contemplative prayer in matthew 6 6 he says if you want to pray if you want to relate more profoundly with god enter your inner room next close the door which is an invitation to turn off the internal dialogue then he says pray to your father in secret that could mean a solitary place but such were rare in jesus time for everybody except the very rich nobody else had private rooms you were lucky to have a roof over your head its metaphorical language inviting us to become at ease and present to the divine indwelling the kingdom of god is within you as well as all around you

3814859 in addition the prevalence of hiv infection and potential risk factors differed by gender but a finding we didnt anticipate is that living in tijuana for longer periods was associated with lower hiv prevalence in men which is the opposite of what we found in women among women longer term residents in tijuana actually had a higher risk of hiv infection

3814902 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3814903 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3814904 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3814905 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3814906 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3814907 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3814908 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3814909 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3814910 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3814911 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3814912 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favour particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
3814913 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
3814914 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
3814915 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities but they seem to favour this system and it works well for them
3814916 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
3814917 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably
3814918 the names pretty good and they would have to rename james bond movies
3814919 octopuses do have very strong personalities they do develop their own favourite toys
3814920 my octopus hates the colour red thats quite a natural response in nature but he particularly likes yellow were starting to build a profile for different octopus

3814923 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3814924 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3814925 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3814926 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient

3814928 actually i have a part that just came up were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children
3814929 but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood

3814932 a country should become a nato member not only when its temporary political leadership is in favour but when a significant percentage of the population supports membership

3814943 its my right to be a total pain in the ass
3814944 i have seen on a number of occasions since sig mccarthys death the failure due to mechanical problems of the lone aero medical evacuation ame capability then witnessed the unacceptable amount of time it takes to get ame support from kandahar airfield
3814945 the minimum safe level of ame capability required at tarin kowt is two dedicated helicopters anything less is unnecessarily exposing our soldiers to the same or greater delay which did sig mccarthy no favours
3814946 would you be happy with that delay if it were your son
3814947 in my worst moments i think that we might be way too late
3814948 they have been jerked from pillar to post theyve ended up in one concentration camp after another
3814949 were only on the edge of what weve done to these people we have ripped away everything language culture land self esteem
3814950 you name any of the things that make you a human being and they have all been stripped away
3814951 it probably means annihilation of black communities but there are some people who will say to you that they are pretty well annihilated already

3814955 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3814956 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future

3814964 irish vote should be signal to call a halt to elitist european union more ground level democracy in the european union is the correct response to the rejection of the lisbon treaty not less
3814965 the failed referendums are a sign that thanks to its own success european unification has reached its limit this can be overstepped only when the pro europe elites stop touting the virtues of parliamentary democracy as a way to avoid the messy business of actually listening to citizens a schism has opened up between the political decision making powers that have been transferred to brussels and strasbourg on the one hand and the opportunities for democratic participation that have remained in the member states on the other
3814966 we should expect two things from our governments they must concede that they have run out of ideas and they have to stop pretending that a debilitating lack of consensus does not exist
3814967 the phrasing of the question must be sufficiently clear for voters to know the consequences of their vote and citizens across europe must be able to vote on the same day on the same topic and according to the same method a problem with referendums until now has been that debates have been held in each national context cut off from the outside
3814968 for member countries that are initially sceptical a politically successful nucleus at the heart of europe would have a stronger gravitational pull after all internal differentiation albeit legally complicated would simplify the controversial expansion of the union

3814992 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3814993 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3814994 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3814995 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea

3814997 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3814998 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3814999 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3815000 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3815001 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season
3815002 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs

3815010 we believe we presented a strong compelling case that individual indian trust beneficiaries are entitled to much more than the governments admitted mismanagement of our trust monies over the past 120 years
3815011 the department is gratified that the court recognized the complexities and uncertainties involved in this case
3815012 we look forward to working with the court the congress and the plaintiffs to bring the case to final closure
3815013 at worse no more than 409 8 million cannot be explained in the iim system
3815014 whatever problems have existed in the history of this trust and however serious the misfeasances and malfeasances of the trustees over 120 years there has never been any evidence of such prodigious pilfering of assets from within the trust system itself
3815015 perhaps it is not too much to hope that the announcement in this memorandum of a hard number will give rise to some off line conversation between the parties in the meantime
3815016 how can we reflect the future we want in our present work

3815024 it all looks easy slow and above all safe yet we know better for what is certain in baseball is that someone perhaps several people will fail they will be searched out caught in the open and defeated and there will be no confusion about it or sharing of the blame this is sure to happen because what baseball and all sports requires of its athletes of course is nothing less than perfection and perfection cannot be eased or divided
3815025 although the impact on their web sites is clear i believe this may end up being just some kids who got overexcited with georgia being ill prepared to say the least
3815026 the illinois born alive bill is virtually identical to a federal law he now is saying he would have supported had he been in the u s senate at the time the bill was voted on
3815027 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point to being born alive as defined in this section
3815028 barack obama had the opportunity to right a terrible wrong that was occurring right under his nose
3815029 but instead he used the power of his committee chairmanship to prevent illinois doctors and nurses to attempt to save the lives of living babies fully separated from their mothers leaving them to die alone in the dark in filthy conditions
3815030 the curse of multi tasking doing two things at once seems so clever so efficient and so modern yet it often means doing two things not very well
3815031 the immune system will start dysfunctioning and eventually depression or anxiety can be the result
3815032 when that happens people are not as happy as we need them to be
3815033 we usually get up about six oclock in the morning
3815034 it started raining at about a quarter to six and when youre in a tent its even worse it does affect your mood
3815035 when you start analyzing it its not just the weather but the weather certainly played a part
3815036 people expect this time of year to have nice sunny weather
3815037 they can go on vacation they can relax and when that expectation isnt met the body is going to have a stress reaction
3815038 its a complex system that will take some time to change
3815039 but im very optimistic that in a three to five year timeline things will absolutely be better
3815040 this is the time of the olympics and were taking about air quality in china
3815041 its all well and good to criticize other countries but lets get our own house in order
3815042 approximately 70 per cent of acute premature deaths will come from these two provinces possibly reflecting their poorer air quality relative to other parts of canada
3815043 i think the public is probably unaware that many of the chemicals they use around their homes or the pharmaceuticals they take themselves ultimately end up in the natural environment and are very difficult to handle
3815044 we really dont know what the long term effects of these things are in the environment some are persistent and dont break down
3815045 were finding very very little going on having very little impact

3815069 i wanted to get it done early i was disappointed by the initial hawks offer they said go out and find another offer there was no urgency no desire to get anything done
3815070 after the boston series we thought things would get done
3815071 but i dont think there was any commitment shown we had a good run wed done everything we were expected to do and we were put on hold
3815072 going above the luxury tax with a team under 500 is probably premature
3815073 we didnt sneak out of town we were in touch with the hawks on a daily basis there was an ongoing dialogue there was nothing melodramatic about how the process unfolded thats the reality of it they were fully prepared for our decision

3815078 these blue chip ad vendors highlight the innovation and business growth that is possible when powering todays web economy
3815079 gorilla nation has experienced huge growth in recent years and subsequently we needed strong database technology that we could operate quickly and efficiently without paying the huge upfront licensing costs required by proprietary software
3815080 mysql enterprise has delivered outstanding performance allowing us to scale efficiently as more and more publishers and advertisers have begun to use our service
3815081 i must state up front that i believe in a pre wrath rapture that in my opinion places the rapture either before the revealing of the antichrist or before the sixth seal of rev 6 12 but i am leaning toward the first or a pre tribulation rapture
3815082 the word says that the tribulation is the wrath of the lamb re 6 16 17 amp re 14 10 the word says that we are not appointed unto wrath 1thes 5 9 john 3 36
3815083 there is no similarity between persecution and the wrath of god and any attempt to do so is ridiculous there have always been tribulations for believers and the church but none brought on by the lord jesus christ like when he opens the seven sealed book that is reserved for non believers
3815084 byrd has averaged just under 6 ip per start or for those scoring at home more than clay buchholz would it be that strange to see him start opposite instead of buch on friday night from a baseball perspective this makes sense byrd is a better option for right now than buch
3815085 paul byrd he of the hgh tainted past the momentous victory over the sox in last years alcs and the frasieresque face traded in his indians cap for a red sox cap today this gave me the perfect opportunity to use that byrdie putt pun ive been holding onto for so long it also means that the red sox might just have found the patch to plug the hole left by wakes dl stint and clays continued mediocre outings
3815086 my only memory of byrd is hating his guts last season him and his luck fueled fluke of a 15 win season and then he went and shut down the sox in the alcs putting us on the brink of elimination still hes post a comment

3815093 he laid hold of the dragon the serpent of old who is the devil and satan and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him

3815277 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3815278 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

3815323 other georgians countries in russias near abroad from the caucasus to the baltic national minorities such as the chechens the west and even russians themselves now have to deal with a country and political leadership that bear an eerie similarity to soviet models they are authoritarian militaristic greedy and not overly concerned about where their borders end

3815328 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
3815329 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
3815330 wed start shooting at 9 or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
3815331 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
3815332 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
3815333 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it

3815341 proponents of the ban say that the ban contains exceptions we do not believe that these are exceptions
3815342 of course even if it did contain exceptions we would oppose the ban let me just be clear about that
3815343 they are so narrowly drawn as to be completely useless to us as a vehicle to justify abortion on demand
3815344 the exceptions arent wide enough to drive a truck through
3815345 clarence was a longtime pastor and leader in the covenant church a man of integrity and grace
3815346 he was respected as a superintendent and loved as a pastor and a friend for many of us clarence was a major influence he was a faithful encourager often telling us how he prayed regularly for the covenants leadership he loved christ and he loved the covenant church and all of us who were touched by his life will miss him greatly
3815347 the conference owed much more that it owned and would easily qualify to declare chapter 7 or chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
3815348 doing that would alienate vendors and tarnish the integrity and reputation of the conference and the covenant
3815349 so clarence using his reputation and integrity embarked on a plan to ask every conference church for a substantial additional gift to the conference not for just that year but for each of the next three years
3815350 it was an incredibly successful effort and literally saved the conference from the brink of bankruptcy
3815351 clarences absolute consistency of purpose to further christs mission his welcoming presence and can do attitude have forever left an imprint
3815352 long before the aggressive church planting movement of the last 15 plus years in the conference clarence through his roles as director of church development and interim superintendent was preparing the soil in the mid 1980s
3815353 clarence so loved the covenant and its ministry that he was out to convince everyone who would listen of the value and effectiveness of the covenant approach in its ministry for jesus
3815354 we have defined a niche market along the lakeshore region of west michigan for green luxury products in this area the population is on the rise the influx of affluent people acquiring primary and secondary residences has increased the demand for luxury items of the highest caliber
3815355 as an import myself to michigan i realized that many of the green products i took for granted were simply not available here and that fact makes this area ripe for our service
3815356 people constantly ask me what made me start this type of business at such a young age
3815357 as far as my age is concerned i love being an entrepreneur it is a joy to help customers rediscover the art of relaxation and help them learn about skincare consequently i wont be one of those twenty somethings searching for a calling
3815358 we choose our brands with extreme caution in order to offer natural and organic products of the highest quality we dont chase fads and we carefully choose every product
3815359 for example a customer arrived in our shop on monday morning to buy a special gift for her daughters twenty first birthday which was that friday she decided on a cashmere throw in a color we do not stock we had the throw flown in overnight gift wrapped it and then shipped it to arrive in dallas on friday
3815360 not only was her daughter happy we were thrilled to help
3815361 the author wants a clear distinction to be made between hatred of the jewish nation which is anti semitism and opposition to the jewish and masonic naturalism this opposition on the part of catholics must be mainly positive by acknowledging not only individually but socially the rights of the supernatural kingship of christ and his church and by striving politically to get these rights acknowledged by states and public life for this indispensable undertaking the active and effective union of catholics is absolutely necessary
3815362 in our time more than ever before the greatest asset of those disposed toward evil is the cowardice and weakness of good men and all the vigor of satans reign is due to the easygoing weakness of catholics
3815363 what are those wounds in the midst of thy hands

3815377 as new productions are mounted i think audiences will begin to appreciate the piece on its own merits
3815378 its two strikingly different acts taking us from the swirling heights of high society to the depths of neglect and abandonment leaving us to speculate on the path of that descent over the course of some 32 years
3815379 the truth of the edies lives is a study in contradictions their story is uniquely american and i think reflects on how we view artists and outsiders in our society
3815380 we think we are fascinated by eccentrics because they are so quirky but really what draws us to them is that they show us portions of ourselves in a distilled fashion they remind us of who we are
3815381 she never lets you dismiss her the minute you think she is crazy she says something which is absolutely and terrifyingly true its what makes the maysles documentary so enduring
3815382 little edie is such a compassionate figure shes very vulnerable and yet very strong shes almost like an angel thats what the musical does for people its such a cathartic experience by the end of the show people would be sobbing its almost spiritual its a transformative experience
3815383 their presence is absolutely gigantic because of who they were in their lives their bravery and courage what they were up against and the staunchness of their characters they really serve as inspiration to people in their own lives being who they are and not being ashamed of that
3815384 we are so pressured to conform to conform to conform but then who are you they knew who they were and they were not ashamed they were not sorry they were proud
3815385 theres an old joke two elderly women are at a catskill mountain resort and one of em says
3815386 i fully expect our success story in china to continue because the visibility and excitement we will generate for our brands during the olympic games will create a halo effect sustaining the momentum of our group in this market well into the future
3815387 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3815388 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how
3815389 could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain who has experience and has been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate that has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not between one candidate thats a talker and one candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3815390 clever negative advertising works that is reality the tactic meets with media and pundit disapproval and spawns accusations of negativity but the reality is that a clever negative ad can be devastatingly effective
3815391 you have people like me who live in the industrial world and move 700 planes and 80 000 trucks a day what wed like to see is progress and what that requires is compromise
3815392 as wind power capacity rises the lower availability of the wind farms determines the reliability of the system as a whole to an ever increasing extent consequently the greater reliability of traditional power stations becomes increasingly eclipsed as a result the relative contribution of wind power to the guaranteed capacity of our supply system up to the year 2020 will fall continuously to around 4 figure 7 in concrete terms this means that in 2020 with a forecast wind power capacity of over 48 000mw source dena grid study 2 000mw of traditional power production can be replaced by these wind farms
3815393 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3815394 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3815395 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3815396 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3815397 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3815398 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3815399 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3815400 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3815401 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3815402 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3815403 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3815404 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3815405 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3815406 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3815407 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3815408 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3815409 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3815410 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3815411 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3815412 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3815413 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3815414 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3815415 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3815416 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3815417 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3815420 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides

3815423 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3815424 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3815425 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3815426 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3815427 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

3815432 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance

3815439 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3815440 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3815441 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3815442 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3815443 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3815444 ballot access is one of the unknown evils of the american electoral process
3815445 there cant be change by electing a republican or a democrat
3815446 i dont think either of these guys are going to do much
3815447 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3815448 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3815449 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3815450 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3815451 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3815452 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3815453 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3815454 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3815455 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3815456 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3815457 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3815458 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3815459 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3815460 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3815461 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3815462 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3815463 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3815464 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3815465 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3815466 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3815467 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3815468 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3815469 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3815470 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3815471 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3815472 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3815473 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3815474 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3815475 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3815476 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3815477 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3815478 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3815479 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3815480 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3815481 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3815482 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3815483 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3815484 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3815485 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3815486 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3815487 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3815488 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3815489 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3815490 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3815491 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3815492 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3815493 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3815494 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3815495 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3815496 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3815497 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3815498 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3815499 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3815500 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3815501 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3815502 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3815503 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3815504 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3815505 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3815506 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3815507 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3815508 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3815509 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3815510 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3815511 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3815512 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3815513 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3815514 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3815515 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3815516 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3815517 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3815518 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3815519 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3815520 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3815521 these are all small things and they all add up
3815522 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3815523 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3815524 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3815525 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3815526 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3815527 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3815528 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3815529 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3815530 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3815531 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3815532 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3815533 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3815534 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3815535 just so you all know we did set a record
3815536 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3815537 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3815538 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3815539 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3815540 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3815541 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
3815542 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
3815543 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
3815544 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3815545 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3815546 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3815547 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3815548 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3815549 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3815550 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3815551 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3815552 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3815553 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3815554 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3815555 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3815556 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3815557 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3815558 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3815559 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3815560 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3815561 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3815562 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3815563 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3815564 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3815565 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3815566 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3815567 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3815568 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
3815569 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
3815570 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
3815571 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
3815572 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
3815573 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
3815574 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
3815575 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
3815576 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
3815577 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3815578 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3815579 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3815580 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3815581 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3815582 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3815583 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3815584 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3815585 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3815586 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3815587 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3815588 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3815589 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3815590 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3815591 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3815592 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3815593 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3815594 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3815595 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3815596 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3815597 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3815598 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3815599 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3815600 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3815601 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3815602 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3815603 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3815604 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3815605 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3815606 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3815607 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3815608 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3815609 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3815610 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3815611 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3815612 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3815613 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3815614 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3815615 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3815616 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3815617 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3815618 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3815619 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3815620 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3815621 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3815622 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3815623 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3815624 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3815625 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3815626 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3815627 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3815628 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3815629 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3815630 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3815631 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3815632 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3815633 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3815634 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3815635 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3815636 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3815637 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3815638 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3815639 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3815640 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3815641 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3815642 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3815643 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3815644 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3815645 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3815646 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3815647 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3815648 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3815649 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3815650 police in kingston have issued cctv images of a man they wish to trace in connection with a
3815651 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3815652 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3815653 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3815654 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3815655 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3815656 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3815657 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3815658 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3815659 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3815660 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3815661 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3815662 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3815663 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3815664 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3815665 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3815666 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3815667 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3815668 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3815669 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3815670 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3815671 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3815672 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3815673 he nader is a reminder that the democratic process is alive and well and still being practiced
3815674 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3815675 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3815676 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3815677 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3815678 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3815679 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3815680 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3815681 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3815682 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3815683 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3815684 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3815685 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3815686 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3815687 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3815688 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3815689 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3815690 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3815691 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3815692 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3815693 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3815694 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3815695 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3815696 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3815697 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3815698 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3815699 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3815700 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3815725 la tendencia hoy est al alza del tipo de cambio hay vencimientos de compra de forwards hoy en en siguientes d as y adem s hay posiciones cortas de d lares de los bancos pero no me sorprender a que puedan entrar extranjeros vendiendo d lares para tomar ganancias a estos niveles

3815730 creo que es una falacia buscar buenos mecanismos de subsidios a lo que tiene que apuntar el gobierno es a quitar ciertos combustibles del esquema de subsidios

3815740 bob carried on working and when he came home we celebrated with a salad and bacardi and coke the numbers were random ones ive had a while bobs been pestering me to change them because the most weve ever won before is 100 im so glad i ignored him

3815742 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3815743 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes

3815752 as a board certified impressible surgeon i wanted to ensure that immediate boob recollection was innocuous for my patients and would make the healing impact easier the findings in this study will earmark women to start healing sooner psychologically knowing that their decision will not impede their fleshly advancement against boob cancer
3815753 an added goodness to reconstructing the boob immediately is that its easier for the oncology surgeon to rank the mastectomy often the boob cancer is so large or involves so much harm that the surgeon has to vanish added harm in the region making it difficult to jock enough tissue to near the wound
3815754 with immediate reconstruction the medicine surgeon crapper eliminate more boob harm to ensure the cancer is distant and use the harm from the free flap machine to near the wound
3815755 with the finding that recollection correct after mastectomy is safe women crapper maximize their possibleness to not exclusive heal physically but also psychologically correct away
3815756 before women had to grappling with their denaturized embody image after losing a boob while physically sick from their effort with cancer now they dont have to delay the psychological healing impact of fighting boob cancer and celebrating that victory

3815768 in the early 1990s i was traveling the back roads of the south selling books when i decided to stop in an old soda shop in the small town of cleveland ga i noticed these face jugs staring back at me from the soda shop counter at first glance i thought these were the ugliest things i had ever seen but the more i looked the more i grew to love them lanier meaders pottery captured the visual culture i had been searching for it was this taste of the real american south that drove me toward an insatiable desire to find more of this overlooked southern culture
3815769 after spending more time looking for folk art and pottery than selling books i eventually got fired the first thing i did after getting the good news was to purchase an entire collection of j b murrys artwork my financial adviser thought i had spent a bundle on magic beans and i had but i realized that people really loved these magic beans and were as touched by j b murrys art as i was i guess thats why they still come to folk fest in droves after 15 years
3815770 this book was my ticket into the folk art world it is the ultimate bible of self taught art it is out of print hard to find but well worth it ive pored through every page and have traveled to find many of the living artists represented in the book
3815771 this 1980s book catalogued the first major showing of black folk art in america at the prestigious corcoran gallery in d c it was ground breaking to acknowledge and celebrate the creativity of artists who were unschooled and untrained to admire the beauty in art made from found materials this show opened up the entire genre of self taught art

3815783 im interested in the idea of generational memory and how community memory is handed down in minority groups based on race or ethnicity stories get passed down through families but what do you do with the lgbt community what steps can we take to make sure that were passing down things to have a greater continuity a shared past
3815784 is it lady like to look like a lady on atlantas streets
3815785 we have a strong collection that documents lgbt history from the 1970s forward
3815786 we had to identify men and women whod spent most of their lives in atlanta and were willing to be recorded talking about their past
3815787 we started getting calls and contacts immediately from people who wanted to see if they fit the criteria wed speak to one person and then have access to their circle
3815788 it was more difficult to identify gay white women and even more difficult to identity men and women of color
3815789 so many men involved with old publications are gone and they most likely had material in their personal collections that documented the city

3815801 if this was my last day on earth would all these things i am worrying about really matter
3815802 i disagree on penn state the nittany lions will win nine or 10 games ive been accurate on my penn state predictions the past few seasons
3815803 i hate to beat this to a pulp because ive said it several times before but michigans offense is going to stink this season and nothing short of charles woodson s return and or a 1997 caliber performance from the defense will render michigan a top 25 team which leaves only one possibility there must be a bylaw in the coaches poll much like the one that requires them to vote the bcs title game winner no 1 mandating the wolverines inclusion
3815804 i wrote a few years back about the recurring phenomenon of michigans overinflated preseason rankings quite prophetically i might add that was the year they started no 4 and finished 7 5 but this is the most flagrant case yet all at a time when the new coach is trying to implement an offense for which he currently lacks the proper personnel

3815812 if the american empire is the most powerful and extensive since the roman empire as many assert what does this mean for people living in the american empire who worship the one who as executed by the authority of the roman empire
3815813 because empires use religion to validate their systems of domination and violence wars incarcerations agressions etc how is the american empire using the bible and christianity to under gird its ambitions and authority

3815816 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3815817 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3815818 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
3815819 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3815820 we had a home game to start last season and we started off well
3815821 blackburn will be a hard team to play against but hopefully we can kick off with three points
3815822 but theyve lost a few key players whether tactics will change or not with the new manager only time will tell
3815823 but we cant concentrate too much on what theyre going to do weve got to go out there and put in a good performance and hopefully score more than them
3815824 ive always concentrated on my form for everton and if that gets me a call up it gets me a call up
3815825 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3815826 yeah im not really in the mood to talk right now so you can head on out and leave me alone now

3815828 a nightmare is much more intense than a bad dream it can arouse feelings of fear horror and distress it replicates our deepest fears and can reflect the different types of stresses we face in our waking world
3815829 nightmarish thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3815830 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety
3815831 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3815832 huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3815833 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3815834 absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3815835 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time

3815844 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe

3815850 symbolic analysts need to understand and embrace technological developments and respond to the human resource needs of a rapidly changing economy in addition workers in the global economy are increasingly expected to create new knowledge by accessing information from broad sources this means they need to select the kinds of knowledge relevant to work make choices about how this knowledge can and should be generated and implement strategies to contextualize general knowledge for more specific ends

3815862 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
3815863 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation

3815867 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favour particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
3815868 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
3815869 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
3815870 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities but they seem to favour this system and it works well for them
3815871 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
3815872 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably
3815873 the names pretty good and they would have to rename james bond movies
3815874 octopuses do have very strong personalities they do develop their own favourite toys

3815894 it was the georgians who catalyzed this weeks bloodshed when its military mounted an incursion into south ossetia and confronted the russian troops there prompting many to ask what were they thinking
3815895 i would say georgia has a very good pr team the u s and the georgian government built a very close relationship and it was too close for the good of either party the u s allowed saakashvili to get too puffed up and think he could fly too close to the sun
3815896 state department officials insist they were clear that georgia should not expect u s military support in case of a clash with russia
3815897 saakashvili overplayed his hand he believed he had the worlds best lobbyist helping him not only with cheney land but that he also had this wedge into the nerve cell of john mccain who he may have believed would be the ultimate victor over barack obama

3815903 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
3815904 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
3815905 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
3815906 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
3815907 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
3815908 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
3815909 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
3815910 this was a policy disagreement i had with administrator johnson who is in a very difficult situation
3815911 i respect the administrator though i do disagree with the policies he has pursued
3815912 i was invited back to epa to do a job and i did all this administration wanted me to do this administration has declined to decide what to do about the profound policy challenge of global warming this administration has decided to make itself irrelevant
3815913 i do not know what motivated him to say that he suddenly realized that this administration wasnt going to do anything
3815914 nobody knows for sure why he went public and started ratting out his colleagues
3815915 he was one of the political insiders at epa people on staff at epa are stunned that hes trying to rewrite history and say that he was a good guy all along
3815916 while he and i ultimately didnt agree on the right way to set an air quality standard
3815917 he liked how i operated he liked my expertise and experience in applying economic analysis to environmental policy making
3815918 it will have legal significance requiring epa to then issue the first federal greenhouse gas regulations i believe that much of the work we did will help the next administration
3815919 it was environmentally bad and flagrantly illegal on its face
3815920 he came into a lot of ill repute at the agency during the mercury battles
3815921 he was one of the principle architects for a policy that proved to be a total disaster from an air pollution standpoint
3815922 my basic philosophy of the regulation is fairly straight forward
3815923 some regulations are quite beneficial to the well being of our country and some of them arent ive tried to apply a consistent set of principles to each inquiry
3815924 was that administrator johnson declined to provide a stronger soot standard
3815925 california has met the test of the clean air act
3815926 sure hes giving corroboration that the leader of epa is a scoundrel
3815927 but whats being done about it the career epa staff people have been keeping their heads down for seven years they figure they might as well keep them down for another five months
3815928 because hes confirming what many of us have known for years that bush and cheney have been especially disastrous on environmental matters
3815929 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
3815930 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
3815931 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
3815932 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3815933 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3815934 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3815985 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3815986 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3815987 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it

3815989 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3815990 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3815991 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3815992 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3815993 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3815994 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3815995 it allows us to kill all the speculation of the last 18 months and allows us to concentrate on the really important thing next season

3816086 youve got to like his progress and i think that is a testament to him because from the day he stepped on the island he has been focused on football
3816087 i look back at my experiences and i didnt take it as seriously at first as he did i have a lot of respect for his effort and determination i mean from the minute he got here he has competed for the job and been focused on football
3816088 hes had a good camp the good thing about him is that he has been in it the whole time hes been here all summer working hard hes first at meetings and has done everything weve asked of him hes got a strong arm and hes a winner
3816089 i think he brought them santa rosa back from a 21 points down against us
3816090 they were the best option i had and they were telling me id have a chance to compete for the starting job i loved the offense because it is similar to what we ran and i liked the schedule i wanted the opportunity to compete
3816091 soares who is considered to be the warriors hardest hitter has been diagnosed with a torn gastrocnemius a calf muscle in his left leg he underwent an mri yesterday morning and was evaluated by a specialist in the afternoon soares who is wearing a cast has been told his recovery period is between six and eight weeks but the injury will not require surgery savaiigaea has been diagnosed with a tear in his left triceps he also is wearing a cast his recovery period is between four and six weeks
3816092 cant sew muscle to a ligament they want to see if it can heal itself with scar tissues
3816093 now this its a humbling process you cant take anything for granted not that i ever did but you really appreciate good health well see what happens
3816094 i feel bad for both of those guys because they worked really hard this summer and they were playing at the top of their game now they have to keep in shape during their rehab and come back to help us defend the wac championship fortunately we have good depth at both of those positions and we have to move on until they can come back and contribute uh trainer eric okasaki and the medical staff did a great job of evaluating soares injury and the doctors were very thorough
3816095 the positive is we have good depth at the linebacker position the negative is we dont have one of our more talented players i feel bad for blaze hopefully things will work out
3816096 soares is a 2005 castle high school graduate he did not play football in 2005 while he was enrolled at a private school he played two seasons for the warriors he has not used a redshirt year because he was a partial qualifier out of high school he is considered to be a senior he can earn a fourth season and second senior year if he shows significant progress in his college major
3816097 with soares and leonard groin injury sidelined elimimian who was the warriors starting middle linebacker the past three seasons moved to leonards spot at rightside linebacker satele was promoted to no 1 middle linebacker r j kiesel kauhane stepped in for his cousin soares at leftside linebacker when leonard is healthy again he and elimimian will play on the perimeter and satele will remain in the middle kiesel kauhane tyson kafentzis mana lolotai and paipai falemalu will join the rotation
3816098 falemalu a 2008 kahuku high school graduate has ascended the depth chart quickly yesterday falemalu was the second team leftside linebacker falemalu who is 6 feet 2 and 240 pounds has the strength to line up in the tackle box and quickness to drop into pass coverage falemalu showed his commitment this summer a week after his commencement ceremony he was living in the uh dorms while taking two summer session classes he also worked out in the morning and competed in 7 on 7 drills in the afternoon
3816099 i wasnt sure if i wanted to come here because they didnt have a head coach
3816100 he cares about the island boys i decided to stay home which is what i always wanted to do
3816101 once the warriors got a coach i knew where i was going theres no place like home playing in front of the family if you go away you go home to a lonely dorm here youve got family cheering for you every home game
3816102 its different coming out of high school because we dont have as complicated plays its helpful that i have all the seniors helping me if i have any questions i can go to them and they help me show me the ropes coach cal lee defensive coordinator and linebackers is always there too
3816103 i just found out today when i came on the field coach cal told me to go with the second team and i said that sounds good vit shows that the coaches think i can compete with these guys
3816104 its really sweet i feel really good right now because i might actually get on the field and run with the ones ive been waiting three years
3816105 my career has been up and down with injuries and practicing hard but never seeing the field but now im reaping the rewards of my hard work so im happy right now
3816106 i feel bad for adam and blaze who are injured right now but were going to keep on practicing and working for florida in the season opener
3816107 at middle linebacker you just find the guy with the ball and go kill them at outside backer you really have to be able to think you have to play the receivers and our outside backers blitz a lot so you have to be really versatile and really sound
3816108 i lost confidence a couple years i talked to my friends and family and they kept pushing me to stay with it now im getting my chance finally
3816109 i think solly can cover better playing outside and brashton would be a better inside guy than an outside guy
3816110 big and physical and strong and you have to make the calls you have to be smart you have to go from sideline to sideline
3816111 with my dad them samson satele hercules satele amani purcell mel purcell theres a lot of pressure but i think i can live up to it because i have two more years to play
3816112 maturity and experience hes grown up hes become the player we always thought he was a complete player that can run hit hes smart being a leader all of that hes showing leadership just by his performance and to me thats huge
3816113 with football you have injuries and sometimes things happen people fall down get hurt cant play for whatever reason we feel very comfortable with satele coming in and playing and you can never have enough depth for instance for the case we are in now adam is not here and blaze is not here for a guy like brashton i feel comfortable with what he can do
3816114 i saw progress from day one and day two and now that its his fourth year he progressed
3816115 i was really young coming in and im 20 now so im kind of more mature
3816116 its their fault theyre making it tough on us they played great today it was their best day against our defense
3816117 what did uhs two losing seasons in the june jones era have in common the starting quarterback of the season opener was not named early in camp and did not control the reins for long once the games started
3816118 we want to look one more day we dont want to rush into it theyre competing and we dont want to take that competitiveness away from them well make a decision within the next couple of days probably by thursday
3816119 were not in a hurry we just want to make a good choice this team needs to know who the quarterback is so they can rally around somebody
3816120 we changed it up on them we wanted to try some different things
3816121 all three made good throws we need to make a decision to get this team to follow a leader i told them to make it tough it would be easier on me if they didnt now we have to go with the guy who we think will be the guy
3816122 they havent gotten a lot of reps but theyre knowledgeable about the offense both have the swagger even though we dont have a no 1 were very deep
3816123 we put in a new format this year the four bucket rule the middle bucket is eight points the outside bucket is three points any contact is one point
3816124 during mondays afternoon practice jantz received a package during a special ceremony
3816125 i see it as an opportunity a big deal i have the responsibility of getting the defense ready im going to give them the best look i can
3816126 they have a fun time with it its a fun thing but it also gets serious
3816127 the coaches gave it to me and just told me to wear it with pride i take it very seriously i think its a big responsibility coach talks about how everyone has equal responsibility on the team and i just take this as my role and im going to give them a good look
3816128 with 30 minutes remaining in a scheduled three hour practice it was time to put the freeze on the self styled
3816129 it was deep and against the wind and he comes through like he always does
3816130 a little pressure never does anybody any harm i enjoy it i actually wish all the kicks were like that because it makes them more enjoyable i like the attention
3816131 that was dangerous i was like dude just dont land on my feet hit me in the head just dont step on my feet ive been hitting the ball really well today was the first day i had a perfect day helluva day not to miss one
3816132 everyone on this team can operate you take out the best snapper in the country in jake and you put in farmer whos still a damn good snapper and we get the job done its a testament to how much talent there is on this team that nobody really takes into consideration
3816133 id rather be known as a consistent 45 yards and in kind of guy than a long hit or miss kind of guy thats what i worked on
3816134 hes come a long way hes learned a lot hes got pretty good balance he anchors well hes pretty stout for a young guy hes doing well hes been a nice surprise
3816135 i wasnt used to the center spot i worked hard with the strength coaches tommy heffernan and mel delaura they helped me get into shape brian smith really helped me with the line calls and showed me what was going on in the defensive packages which im really happy for
3816136 in the spring cadiz was a volunteer janitor in the uh weight room a position that allowed him to watch spring practices and plead daily for a tryout
3816137 we were looking for a running back to give us a look when we got to scout teams he wants to be on this football team hes a full speed 100 percent guy i know hell have his heart and soul into making us better
3816138 hes a big help he doesnt hold anything back hes helping me out a lot whenever i have any questions i just go to him just trying to pick his brain before he goes to the league
3816139 im excited about him because when you find a guy thats got talent and work ethic and focus eventually hes going to help us maybe sooner
3816140 the stadiums 17 year old jumbotron received a near 1 million overhaul of its circuitry and computers allowing the stadium to display a much wider array of replays scores and statistics the improvements are scheduled to be done in time for hawaiis first home game sept 6 against weber state stadium manager scott chan said the 19 26 foot jumbotron screen itself will remain the same flashier and quicker instant replays are now possible supplemented by ongoing stats and scoring updates from around the country
3816141 i would think it would appeal now youre giving a broader base of information youre informed about other games youre interested in how they might be doing
3816142 well stick to top 25 live video of whatevers in the stadium and put the stat graphics over we have to put them a little bigger than a score ticker so people can read it we can do things a little more creative a couple different pages
3816143 were informing the general public to improve our coverage of our property and for security to have a better view of some of the blind spots we have in the facility

3816145 were trying to step up to the plate and make the seat replacement part of the budget every year
3816146 can address that within the next two or three years
3816147 we need to make sure were sensitive to the needs of the swap meet vendors as well we dont want to offset their livelihood were working at it we realize how important it is to the uh athletic department and we realize how important it is to the stadium as well not having two operations overlap
3816148 la famiglia del compianto enrico caruso trova commovente linteressamento della stampa locale per il dramma che ha colpito il congiunto ma allo stesso tempo esprime rammarico per la facilit con la quale si pubblicano notizie poco confacenti i fatti reali i familiari sono tuttora in attesa di risposte certe agli struggenti interrogativi che naturalmente seguono circostanze del genere e non si spiegano lorigine e le fonti degli articoli pubblicati sapere che ci sono persone che gi traggono o hanno tratto conclusioni indipendentemente dal cercare eventuali conferme o smentite non rispetta la riservatezza e la discrezione del proprio dolore tuttavia esprimendo la grande commozione che ha suscitato la massiccia partecipazione la famiglia caruso ringrazia pubblicamente le persone che da caiazzo e dai paesi limitrofi le si sono strette intorno nelle lunghe ore che hanno separato la morte del caro enrico dal giorno delle sue esequie la famiglia ribadisce che non vi ancora certezza sulle cause del decesso non essendo ad ora resi noti gli esiti dellesame autoptico n quelli della perizia medico legale di parte

3816156 this content is kind of terrible do we really have to release this
3816157 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english
3816158 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honor but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3816159 the filmmakers have every right to do what they think is best in support of their movies but we have the right to do whats best for warner bros sometimes the pursuit of those interests results in a disagreement for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that
3816160 id like for us to find a way to release movies like
3816161 that was spectacular tonight the world was able to join in a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit it was an unforgettable and moving ceremony that celebrated the imagination originality and energy of the beijing games
3816162 we saw 204 national delegations march into the beautiful new national stadium in the age old tradition of the games millions of people around the world were able to experience the thrill of seeing their heroes in a sea of team colours and national flags
3816163 we witnessed athletes from these 204 countries and territories united in peace in one place
3816164 this iconic stadium is one of the worlds new wonders it was a fitting setting for an amazing opening ceremony i look forward to an equally exciting and unforgettable 16 days
3816165 opening ceremonies have always been a way for host cities to welcome the world and for the world to gather and share the olympic spirit this ceremony to open the beijing olympic games was a breathtaking culmination of seven years of planning and preparation the world will remember this for a long time
3816166 tonight wasnt the end of a journey but the fantastic beginning of 16 days of outstanding sport competition this was a night to remember for the chinese people and for the world

3816203 het was weer heel spannend dit was weer een hele moeilijke dag maar de dames hebben heel netjes gevaren we hebben wel het gevoel dat we grip hebben op de wind en de stroming daar hebben we veel aandacht aan besteed we hebben hier veel gevaren en veel data verzameld
3816204 het is de ene dag makkelijker dan de andere maar er zit wel een patroon in we hebben wel vertrouwen in onze analyse
3816205 maar we hebben er ook heel veel aan gedaan om ook met dit lichte weer nog beter te worden meer communiceren aan boord over wat we zien en denken en meer focussen op snelheid
3816206 druk ach ja we proberen die hype van de olympische spelen te blokkeren we zien dit als elk ander evenement en doen ook niets anders dan dat we anders zouden doen
3816207 soms kak je in op zo een rustdag dus we moeten wel actief blijven en in ons ritme maar we hebben een spelletjes dag gepland dus we vermaken ons wel
3816208 we zeilen best goed we starten goed maar we missen de slag we zeilen ook geen echte slechte resultaten als je rekening houdt met het feit dat er dertig teams meedoen maar we moeten meer risico gaan nemen zo een achtste plaats is niets alleen een plek bij de eerste drie levert wat op hier dus dan maar meer risico we hebben wel het gevoel dat we de omstandigheden en de specifieke condities goed in de gaten hebben dus het moet kunnen
3816209 ik heb in de afgelopen drie jaar nog nooit moeten vechten voor een laats in de medal race maar dit keer moet het wel en dat ben ik beslist van plan
3816210 dit was een hele moeilijke race die vijfde plaats is goed we staan met nog drie races voor de medal race op de tweede plaats zo een dag als vandaag kan je ook veel meer schade oplopen en dat hebben ze goed ontweken ze hebben een hoop geleerd
3816211 we gaan voor het goud zo varen we elke race we staan er goed voor en blijven rustig ons ding doen
3816212 suponho que queriam algo bem definido e chato quando lan ar minha vers o e estou tentada a fazer isso no mesmo dia ser o maior sucesso

3816223 it was intended for students in michigan who are underrepresented in college applications and attendance
3816224 there are academically qualified students in this state who arent applying for college
3816225 i tell students to set some limits and allow yourself to meet people outside of the virtual world
3816226 life can be viewed in virtual time but it can only be experienced in real time
3816227 one of the most important conversations that should be held prior to a student entering college is the money talk with parents
3816228 as uncomfortable as it might be having the discussion before school starts will ensure a happy college experience for the entire family
3816229 we actually advise students to consider getting a credit card if they do not have one when they arrive on campus
3816230 simply because todays world assumes that every consumer has one
3816231 its easy to take the stressors of college and focus on how you look
3816232 there is a genetic component and an environmental component so if you already have a genetic predisposition the stressors of college life could increase your risk for disordered eating
3816233 find out what your body can do for you rather than comparing yourself to the person sitting next to you in class
3816234 in the past many families would plan to arrive early to avoid the crowds but this actually created larger crowds in the early morning hours
3816235 by spreading check in times throughout the day the demand for elevators carts parking spaces and traffic congestion will lessen and make more of a less stressful event

3816246 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me
3816247 his friends would tell me that he liked me and that he thought i was pretty
3816248 you never knew because it changed from day to day
3816249 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and we had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3816250 one morning he called and asked me to meet him in town
3816251 i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and casey said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me

3816256 how would this isotope leak into your inter dimentional bubble
3816257 phase theory states that the outer ring of the phase hull must touch the dimentional point of origin each dimention contains its own cosmic signature by feeding the phase drive particals from our own space the drive remains phase locked on our universe
3816258 the ramscoop absorbed ezo cadien isotopes vented by the karama and injected it directly into the core
3816259 yes it destabilized the phase matrix and created an inverted phase field a pocket of unstable space the lemrock is trapped in phase so long as the karama is here my people are trapped
3816260 so we blow up the ship and the rift is sealed
3816261 yes we engaged the phase drive and went into a inter dementional drift there was some mild instability but all was within safety parameters
3816262 its a by product of radiotropic refining process we used it to refine coolant for ion engines back in the day but it has not been used for decades not since the ban on the oxyriophine trials during the war

3816264 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

3816310 the resolution may vary depending on the problem generally the vendor is expected to either bring the device into compliance or stop shipping it obviously if the device reached customers already the bug cannot be instantly fixed the vendor will have to work with sun to work out the plan

3816319 a popular government without popular information or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy
3816320 do not separate text from historical background if you do you will have perverted and subverted the constitution which can only end in a distorted bastardized form of illegitimate government
3816321 since the general civilization of mankind i believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations
3816322 despotism can only exist in darkness and there are too many lights now in the political firmament to permit it to remain anywhere as it has heretofore done almost everywhere
3816323 the essence of government is power and power lodged as it must be in human hands will ever be liable to abuse
3816324 the circulation of confidence is better than the circulation of money
3816325 wherever there is interest and power to do wrong wrong will generally be done
3816326 this is the first time ive decided to leave something i really truly love i will dearly miss getting a chance to work with
3816327 comments are messy demanding problematic so are most children that doesnt mean the solution is to get rid of them
3816328 meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read
3816329 i like it when im in the mood for a tart tongue bleeding
3816330 at a time when news budgets are being slashed because of declining revenue how can a news organization possibly justify sending a raft of people to the conventions i suspect the numbers for the olympics are about the same and just as ridiculous
3816331 the los angeles times is sending 15 people to the conventions forbes says
3816332 sorry but in most cases theres really no legitimate excuse for a single news organization to send a large number of journalists to the convention what stories are they going to get that the ap cant supply hijinks of the local delegates inside info about what the candidates hope to do for the economy back home local color on denver and st paul its really hard to understand the need for this kind of bulk coverage
3816333 i wish we could get the person power of 15 000 journalists focused on something that really needs investigating as opposed to two coronations
3816334 what we are trying to do is get a citizen blogger from our area who is going to each convention to write about the spectacle of it all from the average joes vantage point im trying to avoid the stars of our delegation and look for the people who are going who are not in the limelight
3816335 my assumption is that all of those journalists are not there to cover simply the nomination process i would think that a significant percentage might be there for local same purposes we are to localize coverage of a major national news event i could be wrong and perhaps the percentage of local news focused reporters is small but it strikes me that even if it swells the ranks of the media pool covering the convention theres value in bringing big national news to the local level for a relatively small travel budget bloggers are probably another group thats bringing the news pool so high and again i see value in that type of coverage
3816336 for regional papers its as important as a networking and sourcing platform as it is a news event
3816337 we really questioned whether we needed to go and im still not sure it was the right decision in the end i like our local politicos to know we are there and we are watching them
3816338 we need to send someone because if we dont then those local stories wont be told obviously we can count on the wires to provide the national coverage for us
3816339 more than 120 bloggers got passes for denver compared with about 30 at the 2004 democratic convention the gop event will host 200 credentialed bloggers compared with just 12 in 2004
3816340 solidarity with the people of georgia is dispatching secretary of state condoleezza rice to paris and then tbilisi and sending a military and naval armada of humanitarian aid and medical supplies to the besieged nation
3816341 russias ongoing actions raise serious questions about its intentions bush said
3816342 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis we expect russia to meet its commitment
3816343 a series of steps to demonstrate our solidarity with georgia said a c 17 military transport already is on its way with humanitarian aid and defense secretary gates will lead a humanitarian mission involving both u s aircraft and naval forces in the delivery of food and medical supplies
3816344 russia has stated that changing the government of georgia is not its goal bush said
3816345 unfortunately russias continuing actions in georgia blocking ports and attacking ships are
3816346 a day of mourning for the humanitarian disaster in south ossetia
3816347 the aggressor in the conflict that started five days ago the russian government said its
3816348 the situation is dramatic saakashvili said today on cbs news the early show
3816349 we are witnessing a new stage of full blown russian invasion and aggression against my country the situation developing on three different fronts
3816350 the other thing is upper abkhazia in the region of abkhazia which is several hundred kilometers miles away removed from the south ossetia where theyre going through villages again inhabited by georgians and throwing out every single georgian man or woman and children he said
3816351 and the third one is that they have moved into the town of gori and they rampage the town looted the town these are regular russian troops they go into houses they destroy houses there is all this documentary footage around that can prove it
3816352 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war

3816355 mein f nfj hriger sohn wurde beim spielen im park vom blindg nger einer streubombe get tet er ist eines der vielen kinder die diesen waffen zum opfer fallen
3816356 ich fordere alle regierungen auf betrachtet diese kinder so als w ren es eure eigenen beschlie t ein verbot bevor noch mehr unschuldige menschen sterben
3816357 ber 100 regierungen zeigten im mai in dublin den politischen willen streumunition zu verbieten jetzt m ssen sie zu ihren versprechungen stehen und den vertrag in oslo unterzeichnen das schulden sie den opfern aus dem libanon und den 30 anderen betroffenen l ndern
3816358 wir begr en die bereitschaft zum verbot und fordern eine konsequente umsetzung in die nationale gesetzgebung
3816359 dieser vertrag wird so weit reichende ma nahmen zur opferhilfe wie bisher kein anderer internationaler vertrag enthalten dadurch soll auch die r umung der blindg nger und die unterst tzung der opfer im libanon und in anderen betroffenen l ndern stark gef rdert werden
3816360 det h r kan leda till ett val av tg rder som har verkan helt motsatt den nskade
3816361 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3816362 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3816363 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3816364 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3816365 three or four years from now no mobile device vendor no matter what their market position today will be in a comfort zone
3816366 na sie haben so einen blick drauf so als w rden sie sagen gt tut mir nicht weh ich bins doch bambi ihr d rft mir nicht wehtun mit ihren rehaugen

3816370 weve looked at this the federal partners have been bery good in sharing information
3816371 there is no credible threat to the united states or assets in new york from this individual
3816372 its not surprising it might wind up on a list somewhere thats the same thing i would say of the hoover dam
3816373 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far

3816383 one of the most significant pressures that companies face now is weak domestic demand
3816384 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3816385 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3816386 we believe that despite the difficult economic times market share gains and price stability are leading to positive same store sales this quarter for best buy
3816387 it was a good challenge for us because in the final there will be a lot more crews alongside us for a lot longer weve come a long way since the heat and well have to step up again in the final but having seen how far weve come in three days id back ourselves to do that
3816388 our heat was ok but that was all it was and you cant win the olympics by just being ok today we had to make sure we were finding every little inch which wasnt quite happening before we were probably 99 per cent there i think we made a big step forward in terms of that final one per cent but i think theres still a little bit more to come
3816389 i came here with the intention of producing an olympic performance
3816390 thats what ive been doing and ill produce a bigger one in the final its time to raise expectations realistically any one of us can win

3816392 texass rubber stamp junior senator has been hurting texas families
3816393 this summer alone he blocked funding for the troops blocked all efforts to lower prices at the pump blocked housing reform and chose to block tax breaks for texas families and more texans deserve a leader not a lap dog for the administrations failed policies
3816394 i have no doubt the congressional pay raise is universally unpopular but i dont see the connection
3816395 senator cornyn believes the iraqis should pay for as much of the reconstruction effort as possible
3816396 draft regulation that would classify most birth control pills the plan b emergency contraceptive and intrauterine devices as forms of abortion

3816399 were talking about the formats and how many but i think come september certainly not later than october well be teeing it up
3816400 bishop eddie long did not ask me to do it
3816401 we saw it as an opportunity to partner with bishop eddie long and also to provide educational opportunities in what would have beena new market to n c central university when it was proposed to me i liked the idea and i thought it would have gone through all the proper approval processes
3816402 in the end its the head of the university who is responsible
3816403 we should look at ourselves through our own eyes and not other peoples eyes
3816404 and i can understand that my feeling goes beyond the spirit of israeli society only i see organizations like hezbollah as a threat to humanity in the same manner for me as the settler movement is also a threat where you have a nationalism that hooks up with a religious idea i see only trouble im not willing to discriminate between jews and arabs on this score not at all
3816405 when there was the yom kippur war and the israeli army was attacked on two fronts we felt that by serving in the army were defending our country but when the intifada broke out and there was the question of masses of arab women and children throwing stones that was the war of the rocks we felt that by serving and trying to oppress the justified anger of the palestinians from trying to achieve self determination that made it much much harder to go into reserve duty it made us more committed to try to leave both lebanon and the occupied territories the main goal of the peace movement was to get out of lebanon and to get out of the occupied territories i was very very active in the struggle to leave lebanon i served in lebanon twice
3816406 ben gurion said to get rid of those territories no good is going to come out of it people were overwhelmed with the victory i dont think israel had a choice then we ended up with the territories nobody forced us to hold onto that and to start a settlement movement there
3816407 i think that if you ask most israelis today in retrospect
3816408 looking at the results after the month a large majority thinks it was a mistake
3816409 what do you think israel should have done instead at the beginning
3816410 there would have been ample opportunities to launch a strike if the army would have been better prepared and if the civilian population would have been prepared what were these people thinking what were the circumstances that led people into this kind of train of thought that they thought they could get away with this kind of activity being so ill prepared some kind of hubris that goes way beyond i mean this is from my point of view this whole war and the results thereof have weakened israel a great deal and it almost certainly dictates a second round
3816411 i think my criticism of the israeli government from the very beginning of leaving the occupied territories was not trying to strengthen the moderates if israel would have made gestures of support to abu mazen and tried to strengthen the moderate wing and engage with him and give the gaza strip back to him rather than not have any negotiations with him i mean i cannot understand the logic of that i mean they strengthened the radicals who have the glory of kicking the israelis out of the gaza strip or out of southern lebanon thats a stupid way of going about it
3816412 the radicals havent gone anywhere they still have their kassem rockets what do you do with these guys i mean you cant just take rocket hits
3816413 you cant you have to strike back you have to strike back
3816414 how can we stand by and allow this to go on
3816415 you must have a heart of stone not to feel the outrage that those of us watching this experienced yesterday this slaughter was an obscenity an atrocity yes if the israeli air force truly bombs with the pinpoint accuracy it claims this was also a war crime
3816416 israel claimed that missiles had been fired by hizbullah gunmen from the south lebanese town of qana as if that justified this massacre israels prime minister ehud olmert talked about muslim terror threatening western civilization as if the hizbullah had killed all these poor people
3816417 how can terrorism be condemned while war crimes go without rebuke
3816418 washingtons partners in this hypocritical war on terror are given free rein to wreak their own brutal illegal violence as if we didnt know it already the conflict in lebanon shows that truth and war dont mix all
3816419 israeli ministers and their supporters have justified the bombardment of lebanon as a matter of survival total war has been declared on israel so israel is entitled to use the methods of total war in self defense this would be reasonable if it were true but it isnt its completely false
3816420 the conflict was triggered by a hizbullah operation in which two israeli soldiers were captured and three killed lets be frank this wasnt exactly the tet offensive it certainly didnt justify israels ferocious onslaught against the very fabric of lebanese society yes the rocket attacks on haifa are an appalling crime but they followed rather than preceded israels decision to escalate the fighting
3816421 a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method
3816422 arrogance or our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice
3816423 the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together

3816429 the discovery that this protein called platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor pdgfr is involved in cmv infection suggests a new target for anti viral therapies
3816430 every hour the virus causes one child in the u s to become disabled
3816431 by understanding how cmv gets into a patients cell we can identify new and better ways of treating the infection or even of preventing it altogether
3816432 and this virus has been found in several forms of cancer particularly brain tumors
3816433 moreover this growth factor receptor has been known to drive cancer so our findings suggest that its activation by cmv may promote tumor growth if further studies verify this it could help us develop new ways of treating these kinds of cancers

3816469 the fact that it is a true story makes it all the more touching all the more engaging
3816470 yes we laugh with and at times at these two fragile survivors locked forever in a relationship as devoted as it is debilitating but we love them too we care about their survival in a world that has proven too much for them and which could prove the same for us someday as well

3816472 right now the musical is only spoken of in terms of her performance the legend of that performance overwhelms the script and score which is among the best of recent years
3816473 as new productions are mounted i think audiences will begin to appreciate the piece on its own merits
3816474 its two strikingly different acts taking us from the swirling heights of high society to the depths of neglect and abandonment leaving us to speculate on the path of that descent over the course of some 32 years
3816475 the truth of the edies lives is a study in contradictions their story is uniquely american and i think reflects on how we view artists and outsiders in our society
3816476 we think we are fascinated by eccentrics because they are so quirky but really what draws us to them is that they show us portions of ourselves in a distilled fashion they remind us of who we are
3816477 she never lets you dismiss her the minute you think she is crazy she says something which is absolutely and terrifyingly true its what makes the maysles documentary so enduring
3816478 little edie is such a compassionate figure shes very vulnerable and yet very strong shes almost like an angel thats what the musical does for people its such a cathartic experience by the end of the show people would be sobbing its almost spiritual its a transformative experience
3816479 their presence is absolutely gigantic because of who they were in their lives their bravery and courage what they were up against and the staunchness of their characters they really serve as inspiration to people in their own lives being who they are and not being ashamed of that
3816480 we are so pressured to conform to conform to conform but then who are you they knew who they were and they were not ashamed they were not sorry they were proud

3816482 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3816483 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3816484 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3816485 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3816486 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3816488 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3816489 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3816490 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3816491 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly
3816492 nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
3816493 europe has to get engaged physically on the ground and europe has to stop that from happening
3816494 the european union cannot be indifferent to this war these massacres on our doorstep
3816495 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
3816496 it just doesnt seem to me to be very smart in such a time of crisis to decide whether we should revert to the previous situation
3816497 only option to prevent similar acts of aggression and occupation of georgia in the future is to give it the nato membership action plan
3816498 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods
3816499 europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3816500 its crucial for us to offer a venue like this on a recurring basis
3816501 the market is continually changing and refreshing itself so its a challenge for our customer base to get enough hands on information to fully capitalize on the latest trends
3816502 vars and dealers need an opportunity like this to get the knowledge right in front of them whether its on how to sell a server based network or what new programs d amp h has waiting for them

3816510 surely a man must be ready to protect his home should a villain invade it or protect his lady in a street fight
3816511 there is one male female disparity that even the most ardent feminist cannot deny men are physically stronger than women

3816513 there are a lot of people who dont necessarily feel comfortable walking into a more traditional church environment
3816514 people more in tune with the western culture feel more comfortable in the cowboy church service
3816515 we believe in doing things that do not scare people away
3816516 our structure draws on the hidden talents of people i have been part of a traditional church all of my life i am not a cowboy but i grew up on a farm and i love the cowboy way of life i love the commonness of the people here you dont have to put on a church face

3816518 das hat nat rlich meine eigene schauspiel karriere beeintr chtigt
3816519 das h ngt aber auch mit dem deutschen k stchendenken zusammen der macht das dann kann er das andere nicht auch machen
3816520 auch wenn das nicht glaubw rdig klingt meine stimme war l ngst bekannt als mir aufging dass ich sie hatte
3816521 wir sind uns begegnet ich war berrascht wie umg nglich er ist
3816522 ich versuche mir die gegensituation vorzustellen es ist doch komisch wenn einem die stimme weggenommen wird
3816523 aber in letzter zeit hat er nicht so wahnsinnig viele berzeugende sachen gemacht

3816527 niksa has had an incredible summer highlighted by his swims at the olympics
3816528 his 4 22 time in the 400 im was more than three seconds better than his personal best i cant believe anyone at the olympics improved by more than three seconds on a personal best but niksa did and we are all so proud of him
3816529 its a wide world capture it with true wide frame
3816530 a hist ria do colapso de uma fam lia mas com toda a complexidade dos relacionamentos nos dias de hoje
3816531 acho que hoje vivemos num mundo diferente mais aberto e de certo modo mais destrutivo

3816533 its a wide world capture it with true wide frame
3816534 communication is 15 verbal 30 tone and emotion and 55 visual
3816535 theres this idea floating around that if youre a christian then everything that happens to you is gods will its blasphemy
3816536 jesus risked three years of public ministry on telling stories
3816537 youd be surprised how cool it looks when you skip across the stage
3816538 use every tool purposefully including media using media on every song is like chinese water torture to your audience
3816539 are the things youre living for worth jesus dying for
3816540 walk in the authority that god has called you to
3816541 the first thing you have to do if you want to write christian lyrics is learn to be still before god
3816542 they used to say a monkey could get elected in fife if it stood for labour
3816543 i normally vote conservative but i have to say i think the snp have done very well since they got in to holyrood i might just vote snp this time because the tories are not going to get in here
3816544 i have always voted for labour but never again under him
3816545 i liked tony blair but i have no time for brown at all
3816546 i have voted labour since i was 18 it has always been labour but not as long as he is in charge i know he is from down the road but i think he is false and i dont trust him
3816547 if someone else was leading labour that would be different it is the man rather than labour itself that i have the problem with
3816548 politics is not something i talk about a lot but when it is brought up in conversation there are a lot of disgruntled people around here
3816549 they are low on substance and big on image and scots are not easily swayed by that
3816550 the snp government in edinburgh at least seems to be trying to do things they are trying to do what they said they would
3816551 alex salmond is more intellectual than most of the other politicians especially the labour politicians
3816552 i have been impressed by salmond labour dont seem to have any principles by comparison
3816553 he is not a prime minister he has no character he is a cold fish
3816554 he was a good chancellor but he is a crap prime minister theres a quote for you but i would say his problems are not all his own fault he had a lot to deal with after tony blair
3816555 i hope that people will see the writing on the wall
3816556 gareth bale has signed a new contract that will see him commit his future to tottenham
3816557 they have lost much of their raison detre and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3816558 this report has got nothing to do with the conservative party this is an independent think tank it has charitable status i think this report is complete rubbish
3816559 conservative party policy will continue the good work of regenerating cities right across england including northern cities
3816560 when i think of urban regeneration and city regeneration i think of things like the albert dock in liverpool the canal work in leeds the sage centre in gateshead
3816561 i think the idea that cities cant regenerate themselves they were built for one purpose and cant do another purpose is just nonsense
3816562 exactly the sort of vindictive anti northern thinking that led to the widespread industrial decline of swathes of the north under thatcher
3816563 to state that northern cities like bradford liverpool and my home town of hull have no hope of being regenerated in the 21st century and that people should move to london oxford and cambridge is the most insulting and ignorant policy ive ever heard
3816564 still see people as economic units to be moved around not as people with families who want to live and work in the cities they were born in
3816565 liverpool is an excellent example of a city regenerating fast with unemployment halved and increasing inward investment in the year we celebrate being european capital of culture we should be talking up our city not doing it down
3816566 es algo incre ble nunca imagin que iba a competir en unos juegos ol mpicos con mis hermanos estoy viviendo un sue o
3816567 es lindo que los mismos con los que creciste que te vieron nacer puedan estar en un momento tan lindo en tu vida
3816568 somos seis hermanos y mis pap s sal amos mucho de vacaciones pero no sab amos nadar lo que era un riesgo cuando nos ba bamos un d a mi mam dijo que no sal amos m s sin saber nadar nos llevaron a clases de nataci n y ah empez todo
3816569 i see it as my final big contract and i will play out my days at chelsea
3816570 it is something ive said many times and after signing this contract i am very happy and positive i will finish as a player here
3816571 ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3816572 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of them a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
3816573 everyone knows inter milan made a bid for me and that was something i had to look at
3816574 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3816575 everyone knows inter milan made a bid for me and that was something i had to look at
3816576 that was a possibility when we knew they had made an offer for me i had to make a decision for myself and this club has been very very good to me
3816577 i dont see any squads as strong as us i feel very excited to be part of the future and now hopefully we can win back some titles
3816578 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3816579 i feel for sure ive made 100 the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3816580 it has taken a while to get the deal done and there has been a bit of compromise on both sides
3816581 its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3816582 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3816583 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there this is a great day for the club
3816584 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3816585 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with every day he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3816586 ideally i would have liked to have got here earlier and prepared normally at the start of the tournament not after i lost in the singles
3816587 they know very well that this is their last redoubt
3816588 we expect the battle will be a battle of roadside bombs explosive belts and a battle of explosions
3816589 so far there is no deal made talks are going on between the two governments regarding the presence of this brigade in the area
3816590 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worth it or not
3816591 what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay the u n is back to have its footprint increasing
3816592 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
3816593 and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3816594 russias ongoing action raises serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3816595 they moved into the town of gori and they ransacked the town looted the town
3816596 where she will personally convey americas unwavering support for georgias democratic government
3816597 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3816598 its a wide world capture it with true wide frame
3816599 it appears someone had a guilty conscience and brought it back
3816600 i think its very nice of them to do that really
3816601 it seems that the bomb was detonated wirelessly by remote
3816602 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorise them with attacks and crimes
3816603 it could be a signal from the same jihadi groups that they are still around
3816604 the investigation has begun and there are many interpretations political interpretations
3816605 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3816606 we have credible reports of villages being burned shootings and killings
3816607 russian tanks are going through villages inhabited by the georgian population and throwing people out of the houses pushing people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women
3816608 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3816609 taking advantage of this lull we are reburying those killed in the georgian aggression
3816610 many were buried in a hurry just where they were killed in orchards and kitchen yards yesterday we recovered 18 decomposing bodies from under the rubble in tskhinvali today we found another four

3816667 the horrors of the second world war gave impetus to a quest for universal peace justice and human dignity with the united nations at the fore it is a disturbing commentary on our quest that as we commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights palestinians mark six decades of what they refer to as the nakba or catastrophe with many languishing in conditions of exile exclusion and isolation this is a testament to our collective failure to give meaning to human dignity for palestinians and to achieve a lasting just peace in the middle east we who serve palestine refugees believe that there is time to make amends exile for sixty years palestine refugees have been in exile from their ancestral lands nowhere is this more starkly visible than in the west bank where the illegal barrier hundreds of checkpoints and physical obstructions daily reinforce the exile and in gaza the policies of closure and indiscriminate punishment devastate lives causing mass despair threatening to destroy hopes for peace exclusion palestine refugees also face exclusion from the justice afforded by international law the aim of which is to offer the protection security and dignity taken for granted in a world where respect for human rights and the rule of law have become guiding principles of global governance embodied in the canons of international law are clear prohibitions against systematic attacks against civilian populations against deliberately depriving civilians of food against the intentional destruction of civilian infrastructure and against the transfer of an occupying powers population onto the land it occupies the violations of these and other provisions serve to underscore among palestinians a sense of exclusion from the protection of the international system

3816681 due to a safety issue and high defect rate we are issuing a product recall to anyone who has purchased a psp chotto shot camera after july 1st 2008 even though these units have been tested we have been getting reports that some of these units have been running extremely hot and have emitted a burning smell from the unit an already dangerous and unfortunate situation this could lead to the even more serious event of a fire starting from the unit
3816682 recently weve had some tragic fires in ohio started by children playing with candles lighters and matches
3816683 any fire involving a child is one too many thats why its important for firefighters educators and parents to work together to teach children about the hazards of fire
3816684 teaching kids what fire does and that it can kill you is something parents need to do

3816691 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3816692 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3816693 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3816694 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3816695 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3816696 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3816697 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3816698 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3816699 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3816700 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3816701 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3816702 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3816703 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3816704 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3816705 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3816706 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3816707 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3816708 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3816709 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3816710 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3816711 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3816712 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3816713 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3816714 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3816715 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3816716 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3816717 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3816718 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3816719 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3816720 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3816721 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3816722 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3816723 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3816724 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3816725 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3816726 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3816727 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3816728 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3816729 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3816730 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3816731 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3816732 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3816733 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3816734 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3816735 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3816736 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3816737 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3816738 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3816739 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3816740 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3816741 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3816742 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3816743 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3816744 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3816745 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3816746 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3816747 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3816748 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3816749 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3816750 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3816751 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3816752 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3816753 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3816754 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3816755 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3816756 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3816757 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3816758 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3816759 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3816760 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3816761 who are open to doing something on the production side
3816762 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3816763 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3816764 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3816765 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3816766 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3816768 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3816769 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3816770 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3816771 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3816772 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3816773 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3816774 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3816775 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3816776 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3816781 a senior bush administration counterterrorism official said tuesday that an analysis of public statements by al qaeda in the past year shows that nearly half the verbiage is devoted to justifying the groups legitimacy
3816782 have devoted nearly half their airtime to defending the groups legitimacy
3816783 this defensive tone continues a trend observed since at least last summer and reflects concern over allegations by militant leaders and religious scholars that al qaeda and its affiliates have violated the islamic laws of war particularly in iraq and north africa
3816784 at least hundreds of thousands of innocent people if not millions
3816785 are you happy to meet allah with this heavy burden on your shoulders

3816787 do they now have fax machines in egyptian jail cells
3816788 i wonder if theyre connected to the same line as the electric shock machines

3816797 ahh you see that gives me hope because i love knowing that two people whove been together for so long can still make each other that happy

3816834 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3816835 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3816836 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3816837 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3816838 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3816839 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3816840 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3816841 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3816842 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3816843 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3816844 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3816845 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3816846 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3816847 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3816848 not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage

3816850 muslims might not be irrational when they consider america to be akin to satan

3816852 president bush intends to abrogate u s sovereignty to the north american union a new economic and political entity which the president is quietly forming much as the european union has formed

3816854 isnt the democratic party the official sodomizer protection association of america oh i forgot it was just an accident that clintoons first act in office was to promote
3816855 its one of those things where we have very little leverage we have no military leverage at all so its got to be international sanctions international pressure and i think it may be working at least it seems like the russians have stopped their incursion now what will happen afterwards well have to look at and see
3816856 russia didnt beat the georgian army it defeated the us army
3816857 the views expressed by mr larijani are utterly irresponsible and unacceptable
3816858 the federal government has called upon iran time and time again to stop outrageous verbal attacks on israel and endorse the international consensus in favour of a two state solution i can assure you that we are continuing our efforts to persuade iran to do so
3816859 we are deeply gratified by dr steinmeiers strong and unequivocal response
3816860 germany is today one of israels closest allies and a proven friend of the jewish people
3816861 the federal government and i personally have consistently emphasized the special responsibility germany bears toward the state of israel we oppose any attempt to deny the holocaust as a historical fact attempts to call into question israels right to exist have been condemned by the federal government outright in the most categorical terms
3816862 my grace is enough its all you need my strength comes into its own in your weakness
3816863 my grace my favor and loving kindness and mercy is enough for you sufficient against any danger and enables you to bear the trouble manfully for my strength and power are made perfect fulfilled and completed and show themselves most effective in your weakness
3816864 i like mahakala the best he really doesnt seem to take shit from anyone

3816867 what a beautiful way to end our time with tashi
3816868 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias taxpayers and this years budget process but the states leaders have failed to act
3816869 therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3816870 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs

3816881 is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3816882 oh thats simple just get 3 ninja and 3 healers
3816883 tube lines has made enormous profits on the backs of our members hard work yet they seem to expect that they will accept an inferior deal on pay pensions and conditions
3816884 we are disappointed the rmt is taking this stance and passengers have every right to feel angry over the proposed action
3816885 the rmts vote against the offer and the length of their proposed action defy reason
3816886 we still expect oil prices to decline over the course of 2009
3816887 the high level of oil prices should induce demand side adjustments
3816888 however it would be wrong to think that all of the fundamental issues that contributed to the high level of oil prices over the past year have disappeared
3816889 demand destruction is a pretty significant fact in the us and oecd
3816890 so i think it looks as though you are starting to see the impact of higher prices
3816891 it is probably only the substantial near term uncertainties over inflation which make calculating the baseline for the longer term forecasts difficult that now stand in the way of the bank easing policy
3816892 markets have reacted dramatically to todays report fully pricing in a 25 basis point cut by early 2009
3816893 the monetary policy committee continues to face a balancing act between these upside risks and the downside risk that a sharper or more prolonged slowdown could pull inflation well below target in the medium term
3816894 it may still just be summer but there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
3816895 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment
3816896 inflation will come down and we will resume the pattern of normal growth
3816897 break a stick on the back of the opposing players neck you cross check him in the back of the head and he ends up with his face in the glass enclosure or in the ice
3816898 the leaders of our political parties must rise up to the challenge to provide leadership
3816899 they need a bit of more time to reflect so they will do that
3816900 space to reflect about this matter which the other two negotiators mugabe and mutambara have agreed
3816901 all three parties must agree if there is to be an agreement there is no way you can extract a bilateral agreement from a tripartite process
3816902 any so called government of national unity which did not involve mr tsvangirai would effectively be a farce and would fly in the face of any semblance of respecting the will of the zimbabwean people
3816903 i am quite certain that all the of the parties are determined to find a solution
3816904 beijing is so over its all about the tranny olympics

3816912 i have fought against her since the juniors and won many times usually by ippon this time she was the one who won by ippon
3816913 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3816914 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3816915 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3816916 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3816917 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea
3816918 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3816919 i dont want to wear a one of them they look like theyd flatten my arches like a ball peen hammer before we even made it to the dance floor

3816924 i didnt bring any other shoes i have nothing but these

3816926 the shoes i bought him the stupid shoes tell them that his dad likes me
3816927 go on in and tell everyone ive ever met that you wont say the wedding march into the church right now and say ladies and gentlemen i refuse to perform this wedding on account of shoes i dare you to be that big an idiot in front of everyone who has traveled here i will be delighted to come along and see how that goes for you
3816928 oprah has not been asked to introduce him is not expecting to be asked to introduce him and i would doubt that she would want to introduce him she thinks this is his moment i know that she is planning to be there

3816937 the discovery that this protein called platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor pdgfr is involved in cmv infection suggests a new target for anti viral therapies
3816938 every hour the virus causes one child in the u s to become disabled
3816939 by understanding how cmv gets into a patients cell we can identify new and better ways of treating the infection or even of preventing it altogether
3816940 and this virus has been found in several forms of cancer particularly brain tumors
3816941 moreover this growth factor receptor has been known to drive cancer so our findings suggest that its activation by cmv may promote tumor growth if further studies verify this it could help us develop new ways of treating these kinds of cancers
3816942 the dna is released out of the cell in less than a second
3816943 we dont know how eosinophils are capable of catapulting mitochondrial dna so quickly
3816944 we were surprised by the severity of the residual sleep apnea in postoperative patients
3816945 the majority of individuals still had moderate to severe osa
3816946 the second surprising finding of this study was that despite the persistence and severity of the disease most people thought their sleep apnea was resolved after their weight loss and only a few still used cpap
3816947 out of a responsibility and respect for the victims of the holocaust
3816948 we have to prepare our contemporaries for the release of mein kampf
3816949 we have to supply them with objective arguments and give them the ability to hold their own in the political and publicity debate
3816950 an aggressive and enlightened way of dealing with the book would undoubtedly divest it of much of the myth that so unjustly surrounds it
3816951 fail to add to our understanding of such things as the holocaust or the elation with which many people followed the nazi rule it wouldnt even reach those supposedly benefiting from it the man in the street

3817115 one thing i can always say about my guys they play nine innings and they certainly did that tonight you feel bad because you lost but im very proud of my guys in there they way they fought
3817116 i think the whole boston area probably thought the game was over in the first inning but for the most part youve got to tip your cap to our ballclub we came back and made a game of this
3817117 when you come back you have to win that game this hurts you cant get to the playoffs like this
3817118 there was a couple times i threw the pitch where i wanted to throw it and they still put good swings on it theyre a good hitting team but no team should ever score 10 runs in the first inning off you its pretty embarrassing actually

3817169 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
3817170 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
3817171 its all part of a widening crackdown on political opponents both by the western backed fatah movement in the west bank and by the islamic militant hamas in gaza
3817172 i am hugely disappointed not to be able to attend the festival of politics this year as it was something i was looking forward to immensely

3817178 unfortunately in the ethnic cleansing being carried out by the burmese military junta in eastern burma rape is being used as a tool of war as it is in darfur
3817179 the obvious purpose in my view is to destroy the fabric of the community if the women are raped they are obviously shamed in the eyes of their community often times the husbands divorce the women who are left alone
3817180 victimised by the fighters and then be victimised by the men that you love
3817181 it is very very painful and for the women it is pain you live with all your life
3817182 as for the girls you can imagine the trauma and sometimes i would look at the eyes of the women in the camp and just wonder whether she is one of those who was raped and what is going on in her heart and mind
3817183 within the space of the hour that i had with them ive heard of seven tell the stories of their gang rape
3817184 one woman was 35 years old and she had been raped by several of the janjaweed arab militia in sudan and by the time she saw her husband he already knew she was raped and he divorced her on the spot leaving her with eight children
3817185 obviously if you do this to enough communities you destroy the family you destroy the fabric of a community and if you do it throughout enough villages you can shred the fabric of an ethnic group which is what they are doing in darfur and which is what they have done in the eastern part of burma

3817193 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready to play on saturday
3817194 considering he missed most of last season we would hope he would be injury free now
3817195 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
3817196 we will have some decisions to make for saturday davie weir is available again and i believe kevin and kenny will both be fine
3817197 madjid bougherra came in last weekend and did very well kirk broadfoot has been playing centre half since pre season started more or less and he has been doing well too
3817198 i think it is his best position he played most of his games at full back last season because of the consistency shown by carlos cuellar and davie
3817199 i think everyone knows that inter milan made a bid for me and that was obviously an option i had to look at
3817200 the club had the prerogative for me to finish my contract and i had no issue with that at all but it was an option i was obviously looking at
3817201 as i said before about the personal side i dont mean to harp on about it but there was a time where i had to consider where i wanted to be personally whether i wanted to be in london or away from london for my own reasons and that was a huge decision for me
3817202 i have been thinking about that a lot over the summer and more recently i have sat down with my family and coming back to chelsea starting training here again and knowing the relationship i have with the club and the support i had in difficult times recently it made me realise that this is where i want to be
3817203 thankfully we have been able to sit down and compromise a little bit on both sides and get it done
3817204 i dont know jose mourinho is probably very concerned about doing well at the team he is at now
3817205 that is the way he is he works very hard as hard as anyone ive ever known as a manager so i dont know
3817206 i made my decision for frank lampard as simple as that and what i want to do and what is best for me my family and my football
3817207 all i can say is that jose mourinho is one of the best managers in the world that is for sure he showed that while he was here at the club and i have no doubts he will be successful at inter milan and wherever he might go in the future because he is a winner that is his future and my future is at chelsea
3817208 overtime is a good thing to work on because you never know when its going to happen

3817369 that war is about as popular as aids around the world in other capitals and its hurt us a great deal i think
3817370 theres almost no support for it anywhere so i think therell be an improvement there i think also people around the world most of whom are not white are going to take a renewed sense of accomplishment in seeing a black man in charge of the most powerful country around the world
3817371 ive always thought this is the greatest country in the world i still think that
3817372 we have to be great because we make these enormous blunders like

3817415 the fact that an established statewide career politician like richard cordray has less than 50 percent of the vote when career prosecutor mike crites just got into the race shows how vulnerable cordray really is our internal polling shows that the more people know about cordray the less they want to see him as attorney general
3817416 we were already considering a variety of projects to benefit from the funding when we were approached by seahams friends of war memorials group
3817417 this scheme will include some general maintenance work as well as the cleaning of the structure
3817418 however we wont be taking the granite back to its original bright white condition as weve found that people would rather it maintained an element of ageing
3817419 ini hanya pemikiran saya pribadi untuk kepentingan pembinaan yang berkesinambungan mereka sudah pantas dipromosikan ke tim senior
3817420 kesembilan pemain yang menurut saya sangat potensial itu sebaiknya sudah diamankan pengurus dari sekarang bukan apa apa pada masa masa seperti sekarang sangat mungkin mereka diambil oleh klub lain karena persib belum memutuskan apa apa
3817421 ingat untuk membina mereka persib sudah mengeluarkan dana yang tidak sedikit
3817422 karena persib punya diklat persib saya kira akan sangat baik jika kesembilan pemain itu dititipkan untuk berlatih di diklat persib kalau tim senior sudah terbentuk barulah mereka bisa bergabung
3817423 soal nama pemainnya bobotoh juga sudah bisa menilainya saya kira para pemain binaan sendiri yang masih pantas dipertahankan itu antara lain eka ramdani suwita pata gilang angga kusuma cucu hidayat dan edi hafid murtado
3817424 kalau untuk pemain asing saya pikir lorenzo cabanas masih cukup pantas dipertahankan
3817425 sekarang saya masih ada di purwakarta baru besok hari ini red saya akan berangkat ke jakarta untuk memenuhi panggilan timnas
3817426 hamil istri saya usianya sudah 7 5 bulan kalau saya ikut ke argentina saya khawatir teu bisa nungkulan memang di argentina cuma sebulan tapi apakah sekembalinya dari sana program pelatnas sea games tidak dilanjutkan
3817427 berlatih dan beruji tanding di argentina merupakan kesempatan baik tapi harus bagaimana lagi saya berat meninggalkan istri saya karena itu saya berharap dapat izin untuk tidak berangkat ke argentina
3817428 jelas berat tanpa adanya eka ketidakhadiran eka cukup berpengaruh terhadap kekuatan tim meski begitu kami memiliki pemain lain untuk mengisi kekosongan eka karena sepak bola adalah permainan kolektivitas tim jadi jangan tertumpu pada satu pemain
3817429 mengenai banyaknya komentar dari para pengamat soal rotasi akan kami pikirkan dan pertimbangkan lagi
3817430 semua pemain wajib untuk memenuhi panggilan pssi jika menolak pemain itu akan mendapatkan sanksi
3817431 eka harus datang dulu ke jakarta memenuhi panggilan pssi kalau memang ada masalah bicarakan dengan ketua umum pssi serta sampaikan alasannya saya tidak bisa memutuskan soal eka karena semua wewenang ada ditangan ketua umum
3817432 kalau ketua umum memang mengizinkan eka untuk absen sebagai manajer saya tidak akan mempermasalahkan tapi jika ketua umum tidak mengijinkan dan eka tetap menolak bergabung dengan timnas maka dia akan mendapat sanksi yaitu tidak boleh main di liga indonesia
3817433 apanya yang hebat ini kan sudah tidak menentukan posisi klasemen

3817439 the buildings department at the directorate started the reconstruction operations of the ninewa schools within the 2008 plan to develop the province at a cost of 63 billion iraqi dinars to upgrade the educational infrastructure
3817440 all along the purpose of the surge which i helped to father has been to make it possible to bring home american troops as soon as iraq can handle its own affairs and protect its own people
3817441 im delighted the iraqi government feels we are this close to achieving that goal so i call upon them not us to name the date certain when they feel they are good and ready to protect themselves and their own people and thus for all our troops but a token security force to leave
3817442 it will be their decision not ours and if gen david petraeus agrees with that date so will i

3817486 the whole is different from the sum of its parts
3817487 the 1940s started off very colorful with cherry reds pinks and yellows coming into full swing but as world war 2 became a reality the look of the world started to de saturate
3817488 there were many instances of people using very bright saturated colors that from the audiences perspective were overly bright to them while making their site they felt it was right i think its natural people are at first attracted to the brightest colors which is why businesses probably use neon signs

3817517 there were no politics in this game today because we werent playing a match against georgia because those girls arent georgians they are brazilians
3817518 yes we felt for the people in our country but it is not anything political
3817519 i really felt like we were representing the people of georgia
3817520 i dont want to get political because this is olympic games but down in my heart i wanted to beat russia for sure
3817521 if they are georgian they certainly would be influenced by the conflict but in fact they are not
3817522 i have a georgian passport and a brazilian passport and we fought the last two years to be here it was very hard and there was a lot of pressure so i am very proud today not only because it was against russia but because we played hard out there and we won this match and were still in the competition
3817523 its very good for georgia to win and advance to the next round
3817524 and its very good for the russians to go home
3817525 you better beat russia we want you to be there
3817526 we felt we had to give extra for them i said i would give my strength to them and fight here as they fight there
3817527 can you believe it a russian teaching english in china to koreans
3817528 i personally am not thinking about what is going on right now between russia and georgia i dont want politics to interfere with sports
3817529 the conflict has nothing to do with sports sports are for regular people like you and me ordinary people like you and me are dying right now because of the ambitions of politicians its disgusting
3817530 i felt like even if we didnt win we would show that we were fighters and trying to represent georgia as best we could
3817531 i told andrezza i know we have the lead but im about to pass out
3817532 i want to compliment the russians because we never played them before i know they are a good team we had a good match we fought hard we did and they did i do not want this to be a war between us we respect them as players

3817538 i think everyone knows that inter milan made a bid for me and that was obviously an option i had to look at
3817539 the club had the prerogative for me to finish my contract and i had no issue with that at all but it was an option i was obviously looking at
3817540 as i said before about the personal side i dont mean to harp on about it but there was a time where i had to consider where i wanted to be personally whether i wanted to be in london or away from london for my own reasons and that was a huge decision for me
3817541 i have been thinking about that a lot over the summer and more recently i have sat down with my family and coming back to chelsea starting training here again and knowing the relationship i have with the club and the support i had in difficult times recently it made me realise that this is where i want to be
3817542 thankfully we have been able to sit down and compromise a little bit on both sides and get it done

3817545 i made my decision for frank lampard as simple as that and what i want to do and what is best for me my family and my football
3817546 all i can say is that jose mourinho is one of the best managers in the world that is for sure he showed that while he was here at the club and i have no doubts he will be successful at inter milan and wherever he might go in the future because he is a winner that is his future and my future is at chelsea
3817547 coming back from the hamstring injury you are always wary when a player goes out into his first match but with another weeks training under his belt we would hope that damarcus would be ready to play on saturday
3817548 considering he missed most of last season we would hope he would be injury free now
3817549 you could see his worth to the team when he came back in for the cup final last season and with our other wider players chris burke and stevie naismith out at the moment he gives us a good option
3817550 we will have some decisions to make for saturday davie weir is available again and i believe kevin and kenny will both be fine
3817551 madjid bougherra came in last weekend and did very well kirk broadfoot has been playing centre half since pre season started more or less and he has been doing well too
3817552 i think it is his best position he played most of his games at full back last season because of the consistency shown by carlos cuellar and davie
3817553 we at ford see this years consumer shift to smaller vehicles as an opportunity and one that ford is uniquely positioned to answer using the strength of our european small car lineup and our fast moving global product plan
3817554 we plan to answer the call with dynamic fun to drive small cars and we intend to make them profitably

3817569 ive spent more time with senator john mccain than i have with senator obama

3817576 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me
3817577 his friends would tell me that he liked me and that he thought i was pretty
3817578 you never knew because it changed from day to day
3817579 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and we had sex sometimes we would go to his house or we would fool around in his truck just driving around and then parking
3817580 one morning he called and asked me to meet him in town
3817581 i said youre supposed to be on a flight right now and casey said im not going he called jamie lynn and told her that she would have to go by herself she was irate i think she knew he was staying because of me
3817582 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3817583 adrenalin is the best painkiller and the crowd could see i was struggling and really got behind me they were fantastic
3817584 its just the drive that got me through i suppose
3817585 ive trained for so many years for this my coach gave me a slap too anything to take the pain away from my back
3817586 ive had scans and everything it was decided that competing would cause no further damage
3817587 i struggled i had a back injury coming into the competition if the situation had been different i would probably have pulled out a couple of weeks ago but there was nobody to replace me
3817588 i just tried to dig deep and get through the training so i could make it to beijing
3817589 i was in some discomfort in training and only managed to snatch up to 75kg in training and only clean and jerked 85kg
3817590 its not that the weights felt heavy the problem was the pain i was in but after so many years of training to get this far i didnt want to pull out
3817591 my time was pretty average i have had a lot of experience at 200 of going out too fast and struggling at the end at the worlds i went off ridiculously fast and got smashed on the last 50 but i have learned from my mistakes

3817600 turned in results and guidance that although fell short of consensus were not as dismal as the market was anticipating
3817601 was clearly a significant surprise particularly given that this projected increase would be primarily driven by its core silicon business
3817602 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3817603 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride

3817611 doctors dont want patients to suffer they want people to get better
3817612 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3817613 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3817614 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3817615 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3817616 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3817617 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants
3817618 patients really need to be persistent about their complaints in a way that is constructive to get across to the physician that this is something real

3817665 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3817666 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3817667 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3817668 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3817669 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3817670 with the additional capital raised in january 2008 webelieve zeniths roe will continue to lag its peers over thenext few years
3817671 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

3817673 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3817674 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3817675 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3817676 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3817680 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3817681 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3817682 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3817683 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3817684 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3817685 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3817686 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3817687 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3817688 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements

3817690 he underwent medical tests today and has already begun a course of physiotherapy ahead of another check up next week
3817691 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3817692 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3817693 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3817694 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3817695 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3817696 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3817697 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3817698 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3817699 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3817700 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3817701 were just so elated i dont know what word to choose
3817702 we had one last night and cleared 700 that can help the cost with renting a car
3817703 i think common sense would have to tell you it would have some impact on peoples ability to travel and follow their kids
3817704 but on the other side of coin kids participation in sports and especially on the little league trail is something that many parents make sacrifices to do
3817705 its one of those things take that part of life out and go through and enjoy it
3817706 its going to be hectic but once i leave im just going to be thinking about baseball

3817711 its definitely not easy cruising to the chase right now
3817712 we know that were on the envelope of getting in
3817713 were in that eighth through 13th class thats going to fight right down to richmond unless one of us breaks out gets a win a couple of top fives and locks ourselves in the next two races
3817714 weve had a legacy of having really fast cars i think of having generally pretty good engines and better than average luck there
3817715 the thing i love about michigan is you can race as hard as you want
3817716 you can go two and three wide on that downforce racetrack for the win and be able to do that in a cautious manner where youre going to get a good finish
3817717 to run two feet off the wall at michigan is id like to say a dangerous line because one little mistake and it wipes the right side of the car off
3817718 greg should certainly be ok given the mix of races weve got left
3817719 but man weve got to miss the wreck and we cant have a part that breaks who gets in will be more determined by things gone wrong than it will by blinding speed
3817720 we won six races in 2005 and it just kind of slips away from your fingers and you dont ever really know what you did wrong or what happened just enjoy it while you can
3817721 i want to be the best i can be and be prepared to give a run at the title
3817722 kids here can compete with any kids in the state of texas
3817723 whats fascinating here is that we see that nature is able to produce events that can manifest themselves at several locations
3817724 seem to happen from outside space time in that its not a story you can tell within space time
3817725 this is something that an entire community of scientists is already studying very intensively
3817726 i was surprised by the mistakes made by the u s team
3817727 they had a great meet a great day and they deserve that medal
3817728 give us another day and maybe well come out on top
3817729 before this i said i would feel that no matter if it is failure or victory it will be wonderful
3817730 that is what i told myself so no matter the final results i was able to feel very calm
3817731 after falling off the beam i told myself i need to do well for the rest of the routine and perform my best so i quickly adjusted myself
3817732 in this sport you know there are two reasons youre going to be held one is for scoring one is for television
3817733 in no way shape or form are we blaming anyone for this
3817734 i was just really eager to do my routine and get the show on road pretty much but they did hold me for some time i guess i let my nerves get the best of me
3817735 she kept telling us she was sorry but its really hard to know what to say
3817736 you know she obviously didnt purposely make the mistake it was obvious it was just a mistake
3817737 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far

3817745 drug dealers are being sent here as part of an effort that takes advantage of san franciscos leniency
3817746 many of the hondurans some of whom they believe are actually adults live communally in other local cities at the behest of drug lords who finance their travel here and threaten to kill their families if they cooperate with law enforcement
3817747 prices and availability are subject to change at any time offered prices are for base rent only other charges fees terms and conditions may apply
3817748 there is a great deal of excitement in the quantum condensed matter community about the iron pnictides
3817749 for more than 20 years our perspective was limited to cuprates and it is hoped that this new class of materials will help us understand the mechanism for high temperature superconductivity
3817750 precisely how this happens is one of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems
3817751 but even though we dont know the precise mechanism we are still able to make some general predictions about the behavior of pnictides and weve suggested a number of experiments that can test these predictions

3817827 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3817828 we can t afford to continue pinning our transportation network s future to the gas tax
3817829 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3817844 the problem arises when companies pay operatives to pressure politicians to act in a way contrary to their commitment to their constituents what eventually happens is influence on politicians becomes a commodity to be bartered and sold to the highest bidder

3817859 we do have lcdui slated for a future maintenance release and again we did state that the timeframe is at least one month out we cant share any more information than that
3817860 the resolution may vary depending on the problem generally the vendor is expected to either bring the device into compliance or stop shipping it obviously if the device reached customers already the bug cannot be instantly fixed the vendor will have to work with sun to work out the plan
3817861 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3817862 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3817863 scalability is really the critical issue if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3817864 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3817865 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3817866 my situation is the last thing that should be in anyones thoughts
3817867 we have about 45 games left and were trying to figure out what the hells wrong and how to get it right
3817868 it wouldnt be appropriate to have dialogue now we didnt do it for any of them i should be no different
3817869 weve got a very short time to figure this out im not thinking about anything until november 1
3817870 that has nothing to do with it its our offense we cant hit with runners in scoring position

3817872 the brain consists of a collection of neurons cultured on a multi electrode array mea it communicates and controls the robot via a bluetooth connection
3817873 the robots biological brain is made up of cultured neurons which are placed onto a multi electrode array mea the mea is a dish with approximately 60 electrodes which pick up the electrical signals generated by the cells this is then used to drive the movement of the robot every time the robot nears an object signals are directed to stimulate the brain by means of the electrodes in response the brains output is used to drive the wheels of the robot left and right so that it moves around in an attempt to avoid hitting objects the robot has no additional control from a human or a computer its sole means of control is from its own brain
3817874 how memories manifest themselves in the brain when the robot revisits familiar territory
3817875 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
3817876 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions
3817877 investigating the computational capacity of cultured neuronal networks using machine learning
3817878 in this project the neural cultures will be cultured locally in the university of readings new electrophysiological research laboratory allowing real time access to the recording and stimulation hardware via an intranet link up
3817879 architecture for living neuronal cell control of a mobile robot
3817880 in this presentation a look is taken at how the use of implant and electrode technology can be employed to create biological brains for robots to enable human enhancement and to diminish the effects of certain neural illnesses
3817881 yesterday i heard sen mccain say we are all georgians now well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds

3817894 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
3817895 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3817896 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3817897 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3817898 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3817899 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3817900 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character
3817901 i see him as the jason bourne of superheroes a guy who exists with his own sort of set of tricks and i think the difference between ollie queen and a guy like bruce wayne theyre both rich they both have their things but batman is about his equipment and is about his theatricality and about his detective skills and green arrow is a guy whos really just the sort of macgyver type
3817902 dude its ridiculous how many times a day i have to see your ugly face
3817903 is he the boy in the relay he did a great job
3817904 we watch almost every game we know almost every detail how tall a player is who can shoot who can pass i know phelpss race but i am more familiar with the n b a i cant swim but i can play basketball
3817905 it incited a lot of attacks on him from ultranationalists who thought that by simply describing phelpss quest he was saying the u s was better than china
3817906 leider erreichen uns berichte die mit diesen russischen aussagen nicht bereinstimmen

3817920 we have set a very ambitious goal for renewable energy capacity
3817921 and we intend to include a healthy amount of solar energy in our mix already we are the national leader in wind energy capacity among municipally owned utilities
3817922 this means we will double our renewable capacity that at the end of this year should be close to 600 mw
3817923 by 2020 our 20 percent renewable capacity goal should be around 1 200 mw roughly equivalent to the capacity of two large conventional power plants of this 1 200 mw approximately 100 mw will be derived from non wind sources such as solar and landfill gas

3817930 i do feel the eagles have something to win here maybe i can make the difference when its 0 0 or 1 0 and i have to wait and see what the body really says after the stam match my body ached for two days but funnily enough i missed that feeling when i told my eight year old son id return to the game he was really worried he wanted to know if people would kick me in the shins so i told him people have been doing that for 15 odd years or so

3817991 controlul asupra retelei de conducte care leaga fostele republici sovietice de occident i a permis rusiei sa preia o mare parte profiturile pe care aceste tari le obtineau din vanzarea de petrol si gaze dar odata cu aparitia btc sustinuta activ de guvernele eurpene si sua rusia urma sa si piarda controlul monopolist deschizand calea companiilor occidentale de a face investitii de miliarde de dolari in statele caucaziene bogate in resurse energetice

3817993 putin in mod corect a privit nabucco ca facand parte dintr o campanie mai ampla condusa de washington de a izola rusia si de a limita expansiunea imperiului sau energetic

3818010 if one of you always falls asleep in front of the tv or goes to bed early while the other one stays up late thats a major disconnect
3818011 its bad for a couple because youll be sacrificing intimacy and weakening your connection
3818012 even if you fall asleep at different times you should still make time to bond in bed every night
3818013 it doesnt have to be sex it can be snuggling kissing talking reading the point is to do something together in bed together every night ideally you want to put a cap on individual activity if one of you is watching tv and the other is doing something else arrange to come to bed at a particular time and do the same thing in bed together
3818014 what happens is a couples dialogue becomes focused on the practicalities of living and running a family it ceases to address the important issues that need to be dealt with whether they be financial or why are you working such late hours or i dont want to go to your mothers every weekend or whatever the big issues are being avoided because of the sheer volume of day to day activities

3818067 the numbers are the worst weve seen and its not just the magnitude of the problem but the scope so many markets are affected
3818068 im taking a major loss ill probably have to bring a check to the closing
3818069 the bank is willing to do a short sale and we have an offer of 170 000 on the house but we believe the bank will turn that down
3818070 they hand over their keys and walk away from the homes

3818081 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3818082 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3818083 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too

3818099 its no secret that traditional monogamous marriage in america is in serious trouble
3818100 some of the things i cover in my book definitely apply to cybersex
3818101 people shouldnt assume because its cybersex that they dont need rules thats a mistake because i think we can get emotionally involved with the people that we meet online we see it happen all the time while the physical consequences of having cybersex its super safe are great i do think there are emotional boundaries you need to consider and there can be potential pitfalls
3818102 misconceptions about monogamy are everywhere in our society making them hard to escape and easy to internalize
3818103 directness is always good but sometimes thats not the way that people interact try saying i read a poll that said cybersex is cheating what do you think about that open the discussion people have very different ideas on the subject some people think its just the computer do what you want whereas people whove had interactions online knows it can turn into something really serious
3818104 if your he she comes to you and says i want to hook up with some people online dont dismiss it plus even though youre not having sex with someone in real time its totally valid for people to bring up specific sexual activities and say are these ok to have with someone online for example you may do s m with your partner and youre the top and you dont want anyone else to top her even if its someone online at the very least people need to have a conversation and come to some agreement you need to talk about how far it can go can you meet this person in real time its good to address that at the beginning
3818105 the amount of time you spend is a really important issue
3818106 because again you have to treat it as another relationship and thats going to take away time with your real time partner so its important to set limits about how long someone can be online or how many chat sessions a week or what the level of contact should be because it is contact even if its not face to face contact between texting chatting email webcam you could spend seven hours a day hooking up with someone
3818107 one thing cybersex affords us that real sex doesnt is we can be whoever we want to be if you want to you can take a radical leap in identity like youre a 55 year old woman from the midwest and you want to be a 19 year old gay male hustler that might be impossible to explore while sitting alongside your current partner youre not going to be able to get down into it if someone who knows youre not that is present but some real time partners have amazing imaginations and are very adventurous

3818162 neuroscientists tell us about the brain and philosophers try to figure out how to square our best neuroscience with the ability of our minds to represent what the world is like
3818163 ideas that come to us with our spontaneous everyday practices
3818164 the view that in some important sense all there is is the world studied by science
3818165 we humans are natural creatures and if the claims and ambitions of philosophy conflict with this view then philosophy needs to give way
3818166 substantial word world semantic relations are a part of the best scientific account of our use of the relevant terms
3818167 treats the gap itself that which transforms reduction into a philosophical project as a symptom of dysfunction in our philosophical vocabulary
3818168 a use explanatory account of semantic terms while saying nothing of theoretical weight about whether these terms refer or have truth conditions
3818169 to account for the uses of various terms among them the semantic terms themselves in the lives of natural creatures in a natural environment
3818170 if we can explain why natural creatures in a natural environment come to talk in these plural ways of truth value meaning causation all the rest what puzzle remains what debt does philosophy now owe to science

3818241 the current struggles in the auto industry make it more important than ever for automakers to keep the customers they have coming back to purchase another vehicle
3818242 however the increased number of available manufacturers and models make engendering customer loyalty a bigger challenge than ever before automakers who have a firm understanding of what drives their customers to remain loyal will have a significant competitive advantage in this challenging market
3818243 generating customer loyalty is a far more complex process than simply scoring high on initial customer satisfaction surveys or just tracking whether a customer bought another vehicle of the same make
3818244 automakers need to factor in all of their customer touch points across the ownership lifecycle to understand the definition of loyalty that is specifically meaningful to their brands and their customers
3818245 automakers have incredible amounts of customer data from virtually every customer touch point

3818256 support for president saakashvili is now a matter of principle for the majority in georgia as we face a military aggression from russia

3818258 it would have been better not to start this war in the first place but to seek a political solution

3818269 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3818270 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3818271 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3818272 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on

3818416 what we should be talking about is food security not food production
3818417 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3818418 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
3818419 we have many more hungry people to feed today than even just a few months ago
3818420 including at least 14 million people in the horn of africa where drought and insecurity coupled with high food prices is putting lives at risk
3818421 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
3818422 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
3818423 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
3818424 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3818425 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
3818426 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
3818427 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
3818428 one of the reuses that has been suggested certainly by the city of san francisco is to put a new 49ers stadium on hunters point
3818429 from an environmental perspective building something like a stadium is actually a very good reuse
3818430 we look very favorably on that idea because it will allow us to clean up hunters point shipyard and candlestick and get it completed for the 49ers and for the neighborhoods and communities sooner than we had believed possible
3818431 i would like everyone thats involved to understand its a worse deal to close now and lose more money close now with the facts weve gotten

3818435 while some are speculating about cyber warfare and state sponsorship we have no data to indicate anything of the sort at this time we are seeing some botnets some well known and some not so well known take aim at georgia websites these attacks were mostly tcp syn floods with one tcp rst flood in the mix no icmp or udp floods detected here these attacks were all globally sourced suggesting a botnet or multiple botnets were behind them
3818436 all of these are http floods ie rapid fire get requests
3818437 why have these new attacks been classified as incidents of cyberwarfare when so many attacks that came before them were not

3818447 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3818448 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3818449 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3818450 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3818451 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3818452 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3818453 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3818454 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3818455 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3818456 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3818457 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3818458 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else

3818461 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with every day he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game

3818485 be dressed for service and well prepared as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks there will be special favor for those who are ready and waiting for his return i tell you he himself will seat them put on an apron and serve them as they sit and eat he may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn but whenever he comes there will be special favor for his servants who are ready
3818486 i am talking to any faithful sensible servant to whom the master gives the responsibility of managing his household and feeding his family
3818487 but people who are not aware that they are doing wrong will be punished only lightly much is required from those to whom much is given and much more is required from those to whom much more is given
3818488 but we worked as a team and all the months of training seem to have paid off i need to thank my team mates and my coach you know i am just taking it day by day i am just happy to be here
3818489 you know i am just working on the things i need to improve
3818490 you are so gorgeous you sure youre not married and if not i dont know why
3818491 i found out the day after my singles match id lost four and a half kilos since i arrived here
3818492 i didnt prepare as well as i should have done it was unprofessional and something i need to learn from
3818493 ill have to make sure it doesnt happen again because i think im playing really well right now the us open is my favourite tournament and i believe i can do really well there
3818494 ideally id have like to have got here earlier but i didnt because i played very well in cincinnati
3818495 normally at each tournament i weigh myself right at the start and i should have checked that as soon as i got here instead of the day after my match
3818496 we didnt serve particularly well or return well and it was always going to be difficult if you cant put any pressure on them
3818497 after being a part of the olympics for the first time and seeing what it means when the athletes win medals and how big a deal it is you realise how much you want to do well and sometimes you want it a bit too much and dont play so well
3818498 the funds industry in the middle east has seen rapid growth in the past few years spurred by the growth of the economy and the availability of a world class financial services infrastructure the increasing commitment shown by leading firms like lionhart in the region will boost the market for funds generally and for hedge funds specifically we look forward to providing lionhart with the services that will support their efforts to develop their business in the region
3818499 our global expansion continues with the launch of our gulf operations we feel strongly that our track record of achieving strong absolute non correlated annual returns on a consistent basis while maintaining a core commitment to preservation of investor capital fits well with the appetites of investors in the gulf

3818507 we were heading for sidi beshr beach in alexandria on july 23 but a policeman prevented us from getting there we had a large kite painted with the egyptian flag and we were wearing t shirts with a sign of april 6 movement printed on them
3818508 the july 23 event was not a huge demonstration we werent more than 100 people walking down the street when state security approached us and asked what we were doing
3818509 it was the international attention through amnesty international and other activist efforts that spurred the quick release of our members
3818510 this regulation which represents a clear invasion of privacy and a form of censorship on internet users became a reality a few months ago
3818511 those wanting to use the internet are given a scratch card and instructed to log onto the home page of the internet provider where they fill out their names and phone numbers you can always fake your name of course but by giving out your phone number the government can track you through the telecommunications authority
3818512 an internet provider official told an egyptian newspaper that they were doing it to decrease credit card and identity theft
3818513 but if they were after money you would just buy a card with a user name and pin code the fact that you have to give them your name and phone number does not support that theory
3818514 this severely abusive procedure comes to prove the security policies and aims to impose constraints and censorship on the internet users with assistance of the internet and telecommunications service companies
3818515 we can and do take action to protect consumers from illegal share schemes as is evident in this case however consumers must also be vigilant and check that the firm they are dealing with is authorised if not they risk losing some or all of the money they have invested

3818561 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3818562 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3818563 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3818564 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3818565 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3818566 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3818567 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3818568 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3818569 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3818570 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3818571 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3818572 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3818573 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3818574 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3818575 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3818576 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3818577 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3818578 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3818579 yes id like a hot dog with just ketchup please

3818581 yeah it would be nice to be closer to family but you cant beat the weather

3818586 and today only for 49 95 you can become an associate and start living the dream
3818587 we dont stop dreaming because we get old we get old because we stop dreaming
3818588 thank you for the opportunity but this just isnt for me
3818589 someone jacked it from the library half an hour ago
3818590 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3818591 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3818592 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3818593 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3818594 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3818595 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3818596 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3818597 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3818598 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3818599 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3818600 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3818601 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3818602 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3818603 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3818604 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3818605 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3818606 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3818607 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3818608 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3818609 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3818610 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3818611 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3818612 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3818613 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3818614 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3818615 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3818616 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3818617 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3818618 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3818619 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3818620 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3818621 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3818630 demonstrate the artists love of popular culture while using it to skewer the prejudice and stereotyping he has encountered over four decades
3818631 shimomuras deft wry humor and remarkable skill come together in his work to dig deep at his identity our cultural assumptions and the marvelous follies of contemporary american art
3818632 we are eager to bring shimomuras work to grinnell because of the interdisciplinarity of his way of making art and the strength of his social conscience
3818633 shimomura is a significant artist because of his charged social subject matter

3818710 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3818711 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3818712 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3818713 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3818721 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3818722 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3818723 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3818724 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3818725 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3818726 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3818727 while some are speculating about cyber warfare and state sponsorship we have no data to indicate anything of the sort at this time we are seeing some botnets some well known and some not so well known take aim at georgia websites these attacks were mostly tcp syn floods with one tcp rst flood in the mix no icmp or udp floods detected here these attacks were all globally sourced suggesting a botnet or multiple botnets were behind them
3818728 all of these are http floods ie rapid fire get requests

3818732 mobile phones are increasingly becoming software driven platforms although they were just for voice before
3818733 as we get screens that can roll or fold out to be bigger or mobile devices that have small screens but can project larger images on walls that line between whats a pc and a mobile will keep getting grayer

3818736 iphone 2 0 is ready for the enterprise but caveats apply
3818737 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice e mail personal information manager and browsing
3818738 consisting of a combination of alpha numeric and special characters in a pattern that cannot be easily guessed
3818739 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3818740 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3818741 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3818742 organizationally were heading toward migration from lotus notes to exchange which will take some time once weve done that well evaluate the use of iphone versus blackberry
3818743 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3818744 accept the lowered overall security footprint that adoption will dictate or block the device from use
3818745 which could be an issue if the it organization hasnt verified what apple has delivered
3818746 we strongly suggest that enterprises use existing management tools to modify the itunes registry entries to disable firmware updates file transfers and other activities that could inject unwanted content into the enterprise as well as to lock down the registry
3818747 eliminate itunes as a desktop application as a necessary component to access business applications and manage the device as microsoft and rim have done
3818748 although we cannot confirm what is causing the battery life to be so short we believe it to be apples implementation of exchange activesync and or wi fi
3818749 apple has delivered an iphone that is acceptable for business use at the appliance level most prospective iphone users will judge the device based on consumer appeal the app store applications and the iphones excellent browser are supplemented with an e mail client which provides acceptable business capability with excellence in some areas

3818751 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3818756 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region

3818793 confrontational rhetoric notwithstanding russias leaders are conscious of their strategic limitations indeed i would characterize russian policy under putin as driven in a quest for a reliable strategic partner with america being the preferred choice but the movement of the western security system from the elbe river to the approaches to moscow brings home russias decline in a way bound to generate a russian emotion that will inhibit the solution of all other issues it should be kept on the table without forcing the issue to determine the possibilities of making progress on other issues

3818834 la gente comprender finalmente que este es el rumbo acertado y naturalmente por descontentos o por desaprobaci n en encuestas moment neas ser a una irresponsabilidad cambiar los objetivos que nos hemos planteado
3818835 der reaktionsschnelligkeit des vaters ist es zu verdanken dass es nicht zum vollbrand kam
3818836 gandhi believed in serving humanity and seva bharati is also doing the same
3818837 any award named after mahatma gandhi should only be conferred on an institution or a person dedicated to gandhian principles but the award conferred on an organisation allied to the rss raises doubts on the intentions of the government already working on saffron agenda it is an insult to gandhi
3818838 it was unfortunate and biggest injustice done by this government in the name of gandhi it was also a direct attack on gandhian principles
3818839 two years after this book m s golwalkars we or our nationhood defined was published the jamaat e islami was founded on august 26 1941 under the leadership of maulana abul ala maududi the founding conference was held in pathankot maududi is to the jamaat what golwalkar is to the rss the similarity of their political project and roles is indeed remarkable
3818840 weve found that in all the tests they do tend to favour particular limbs which tends to give them a legs and arms sort of layout
3818841 their front two tentacles will be used for a lot of exploratory work and then the ones immediately behind them will then be used also if further investigation is needed
3818842 then the further back you go the more the limbs are used for propulsion and movement
3818843 from what weve seen all the limbs basically have the same capabilities but they seem to favour this system and it works well for them
3818844 with live prey it does help them when sneaking up with the front limbs ready to pounce and using the back ones for propulsion
3818845 they have that facility unlike humans where if we tried to grab our food with our feet we might fail miserably
3818846 the names pretty good and they would have to rename james bond movies
3818847 octopuses do have very strong personalities they do develop their own favourite toys
3818848 my octopus hates the colour red thats quite a natural response in nature but he particularly likes yellow were starting to build a profile for different octopus

3818851 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
3818852 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
3818853 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
3818854 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
3818855 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3818856 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
3818857 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
3818858 the project gives us a unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
3818859 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
3818860 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea i guess to do that but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3818861 for years congressman eric cantor has been a rising star in the republican party congressman cantor has been a leader while protecting america through strong national security keeping taxes low and preparing america for its next biggest challenges senator john mccain has recognized congressman eric cantors leadership and is currently vetting cantor as one of a short number of candidates to be considered for the vice presidential candidate america needs senator john mccain as president and america needs eric cantor as its vice president

3818868 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
3818869 had argued that their asbestos product was different and incapable of causing lung cancer and mesothelioma the jury rejected these arguments and now their verdict has been unanimously upheld by the appellate court
3818870 we proved that asbestos from the coating of these rods would be released in the air and breathed in by workers like mr gomez and mr tucker who had no idea that asbestos could kill them
3818871 i consider myself biased and thats ok i want the volt to succeed

3818873 my goggles pretty much filled with water and it kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest
3818874 but i wanted to break the record i wanted to 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad

3818877 it is a lot of racing and its not easy the next ones are pretty important
3818878 i thought there was an advantage because ive been on the international competition scene a long time but today i guess i let the pressure get to me
3818879 this proves once again the chinese womens team is the best and most excellent team every team member performed well but it also revealed its a team effort
3818880 i had one foot on the beam and i stepped back but there was nothing for my foot to stand on
3818881 i was pretty nervous i just let my nerves get to me
3818882 we knew we had to hit three out of three on beam to get back on rack and i think she took it too much on herself
3818883 unfortunately we made two mistakes you cant win gold with two mistakes
3818884 when i won the world championships in salzburg 2006 i knew i wanted to come to the olympic games in 08 and i knew i wanted the medal
3818885 getting second in stuttgart world championships 2007 was a blessing in disguise i guess it was kind of a wake up call that i cant just show up and win it refocused and remotivated me and made me focus on the little things
3818886 were not related but i think we have a lot of similarities
3818887 we both have a triathlon background lance has done some wonderful things for cycling and wonderful things for cancer research i hope to follow in his footsteps and be a role model for the country and up and coming riders
3818888 i know it wont hurt but it will take a lot more than this to make judo big in the usa

3818890 im a little discouraged but it was a great experience
3818891 it was awesome we did our best a couple of things were off in the meet but we had full intentions of a silver medal
3818892 i think the most memorable story i heard was when somebody said when they were going through a breakup your song motivated them to get back in the game and they give you the credit for that
3818893 or they heard my song and picked up a guitar and started writing songs and now have a way to channel their emotions things like that really move me
3818894 im not sure that it was quite 1 million but it was pretty up there i got a custom made tour bus with a fireplace a pull down treadmill all kinds of cool stuff its got hardwood floors
3818895 i had to have it because thats what i live on the majority of my time is spent on the road and when im out there you want to be comfortable and feel like youre home
3818896 i think everybody has a little bit of rebellion in them but for me it comes out in my songs
3818897 my rebellion is writing a song about a guy and putting his name in a song
3818898 hes got such a unique voice that people would definitely be able to tell that it was him on the track

3819037 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3819038 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3819039 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russia actions that are inconsistent with these statements

3819057 if that was meant to be an impersonation of me i wouldnt give up the day job martha carolled over her shoulder as she ran for the wardrobe
3819058 one of these days youre going to have to show me how you do that she said as they slipped around the side of the school
3819059 and let me guess youve had a lot of practice
3819060 wait a minute i think i may have a candle in my pockets here somewhere
3819061 no im afraid not tell you what why dont i just tell you ill explain later and well skip onto the next part
3819062 the part where i tell you to look behind you
3819063 because last time i looked we were about three millennia shy of that century ah let me guess this is where the chronon levels come in isnt it
3819064 actually that particular descriptive term hadnt occurred to me but now that you mention it
3819065 classic mind probe standard procedure for this sort of thing
3819066 not only is your future self being held hostage by the hal from hell but he also has a great big ruddy metal rod thing sticking out of his head and you want to lay bets on the robots motives
3819067 but hell never survive the process pain free or not
3819068 marthas doctor said as if in answer the shadow was now spreading to the lower part of his face and some instinct told her that he didnt have long to live
3819069 well short of this a i suddenly coming to its senses and popping back to where it belongs i dont see how we have much choice
3819070 cant you see what youre doing is wrong youre a fifty first century a i for rassilons sake your existence is
3819071 no choice no choice right wrong no choice we must be free
3819072 hell wake up with a clanger of a headache but hell be okay
3819073 no martha i meant what i said you did nothing wrong
3819074 neither did i for that matter we did what we had to do the person responsible for this is long dead and deserves to stay there as far as im concerned i just feel sorry for the a i
3819075 that he had no choice he meant it literally didnt he
3819076 come on ill help you get him to his rooms
3819077 oh no they didnt just let me go they fired me without pay
3819078 and when i asked him what exactly he d been smoking last night he told me to it was useless to deny it because jenkins had told him all about my upbringing on the sugar plantations of jamaica and how my master also happened to be my cousin it went downhill from there
3819079 charlotte has a lot to answer for in that regard and the vodoun religion is much maligned
3819080 im going to try and get a job at the local pub but without references its going to be hard yeah
3819081 the doctor isnt talking to me either he says he doesnt remember last night but you should have seen the look he gave me this morning
3819082 and he may as well be a child if the family of blood find him in this condition
3819083 the doctor looked down and studied his hands i can make it all go away
3819084 oh its possible at least for the next few hours the a i came from the future remember this wasnt supposed to be the present timeline and it wont be set for another few hours i can give it a little nudge push it back into its original groove and time will heal around it again it can be done

3819092 we dont watch the beating we have been beaten ourselves and it has long ceased to be of any interest nor do we feel particularly sorry for the gunners they shouldnt have gotten caught they have seen too little of the war to sell bullets only we are entitled to do that we know death weve heard it whistling over our heads and seen how it mangles bodies and we have the right to bring it upon others and these two havent whats more the new recruits are strangers in our battalion not yet soldiers not one of us but most of all we are upset that we can no longer use the gap in the fence

3819115 what isnt adorable about a little girl with crooked teeth chubby cheeks and a voice of an angel this girl reportedly said she didnt mind singing in the wings and that it was a honor to sing for her country god bless her but what kind of message does that send to her

3819137 it will take time to bring the laity on board with this proposal
3819138 there is no proposal under consideration either publicly or privately for the episcopal diocese of fort worth to become part of the roman catholic church
3819139 does not change on a whim to suit the transient issues of the day
3819140 they want to be roman catholic and want the diocese to be catholic with them
3819141 church laws are very clear that a diocese is the people and their church properties and theres no way a diocese can withdraw
3819142 that can only be done by the general convention of the episcopal church

3819161 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3819162 you off to work you should look happier than that
3819163 i used to work here as the estate manager but i got out to do something i really wanted to do
3819164 ive always been an outdoor bloke so i teach canoeing now i can teach all sorts of people even old people even you
3819165 im sure this suit would fit you want to swap
3819166 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3819167 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3819168 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3819169 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3819170 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3819171 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3819172 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3819173 in very good condition despite its age it has been in storage since the final shows in 1994 there is little damage and no signs of damp or mould
3819174 we think this underscores best buys strong working relationship with apple and provides even greater differentiation from peers
3819175 in addition we believe the iphone will help grow traffic and sales in this years holiday season which could be weak overall on slowed consumer spending
3819176 we believe that despite the difficult economic times market share gains and price stability are leading to positive same store sales this quarter for best buy
3819177 we are begging that president suleiman comes back from damascus with toufiq with him because hes an innocent man and his family is suffering
3819178 hes spent nearly a quarter century in prison and thats enough for any crime
3819179 we really want a positive relationship with syria and this is best achieved through the establishment of diplomatic relations the proper demarcation of our shared border and the resolution of all pressing issues including the question of lebanese persons still detained in syria
3819180 we are not saying all 17 000 are in syria but we know that there are a few hundred from the testimonies of family members and witnesses
3819181 i say to the families of those missing and those detained that he who has been patient for 30 years can wait a bit longer
3819182 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3819183 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3819184 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3819185 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3819186 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3819187 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
3819188 were proud of anyone who has worked on the side of angels in fledgling democracies
3819189 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3819190 as you know through the nato membership if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all
3819191 i do not see any obtainable objectives in lebanon and the longer we stay there the harder it will be to leave
3819192 if you get involved in a major ground war in the saudi desert i think support will erode significantly
3819193 nor should it be supported we cannot even contemplate in my view trading american blood for iraqi blood
3819194 while he was an iconic figure to many to us he was husband father and friend we will ever miss his love wisdom humor and the familiar comfort of his voice
3819195 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3819196 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how its very obviously biden it wont be bayh because they lose the senate seat with the repub gov in indian
3819197 the government has 100 control in wardak and the taleban are in a very poor condition in this province they do not have the support of the people
3819198 some of the incidents that took place on the highways are because we did not have enough afghan national police and there is misinformation against us
3819199 now the karzai government is building roads and bringing development unfortunately they cannot bring security
3819200 in my view this government is better than the taleban as there was no education economy or development
3819201 now the economy is good and children and going to school even girls the taleban were brutal and took power by force not democracy
3819202 security in itself is a challenge there are places where our de miners cannot go because of the security risk
3819203 its as close to kabul as logar and thats of a concern to us
3819204 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3819205 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3819206 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3819207 the entire angel flight world is saddened and surprised and shocked that this is happening all at once
3819208 is there any commonality its just so strange to have this happen after such a long history
3819209 the plane just did a nosedive straight down to the pavement

3819213 i couldnt believe that i felt like the pope for a minute i just play basketball
3819214 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3819215 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3819216 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3819217 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3819218 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3819219 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3819220 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3819221 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3819222 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3819223 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3819224 part of the burden for elizabeth had been the lie
3819225 and thats why its so painful for her to see the father of her children become a pariah
3819226 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3819227 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3819228 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3819229 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3819241 it is most likely that those who made the recent military coup in mauritania would not take a step if it did not receive the approval of the infidels of america france and israel
3819242 right from the beginning i have always believed and also expressed the peoples republic of china the most populated nation very important so the international community should not isolate china must bring it into the mainstream of the world community
3819243 and certain principles such as democracy human rights religious freedom rule of law in these principle matters you should be firm
3819244 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3819245 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3819246 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3819247 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3819248 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3819249 there is at least one silver lining in whats otherwise fairly painful news and that is that less driving means less air pollution and fewer global warming emissions
3819250 the launch of bbc alba is a wonderful milestone for broadcasting

3819284 but it does not mean that i did something extraordinary all my other colleagues as well as other journalists did a good job reporting the burma situation
3819285 show extraordinary strength of character and integrity while reporting news under dangerous or difficult circumstances

3819287 kondisi sheila masih agak shock dan pucat kita bisa pahami mungkin ini yang pertama kali dia berhubungan dengan polisi
3819288 yang jelas dia ditangkap di apartemen di sana ada barang bukti tapi perlu diselidiki lagi barang itu milik siapa
3819289 rencananya besok kita ingin minta penangguhan penahanan sesuai uu kuhp pasal 60 yang isinya bahwa seorang terdakwa atau tersangka punya hak permohonan untuk pengajuan penangguhan penahanan
3819290 dia cuma bilang kenapa ini harus terjadi ini suatu kesalahan
3819291 biarlah dari kejadian ini dia belajar dari sesuatu biar dia dapat lebih bijak jika memilih teman
3819292 mungkin ini akibat coba coba sheila hanya berada di tempat yang salah dan waktu yang salah tapi kan nggak tahu dia pakai atau tidak
3819293 sekarang kondisinya sehat nggak apa apa udah stabil nggak batuk batuk lagi dia mengungkapkan penyesalannya saya belum bisa ngomong banyak sama dia
3819294 the financial services authority has today fined the uk operations of credit suisse for breaching fsa principles 2 and 3 by failing to conduct their business with due skill care and diligence and failing to organise and control their business effectively
3819295 the penalty reflects our tougher stance on enforcement and our policy of imposing higher penalties to achieve credible deterrence
3819296 it has been proven over the last 40 years that the ibm mainframe is the core of the enterprise data center universe and a technology that is never going to go away
3819297 we have been educating and training our students for careers by using a technology platform that we believe in and organizations like tsys see it as the foundation for their own data centers were pleased to play a role in this collaborative partnership
3819298 our knowledgeable consultative team members are the lifeblood of our company and we continually need to add the best programmers in the world to maintain update and program our ibm mainframes with the latest technology and software to enable constant reliability and availability to our customers
3819299 our relationship with columbus state university and ibm provides us the strategic insight and access to some of the best mainframe and large enterprise computing skills in the world and were looking forward to continually employing new generations of mainframe programmers
3819300 organizations that own zseries platforms should make an investment of time and involvement in programs to ensure a steady supply of candidates with the right mix of skills
3819301 even if cios face no current shortage of mainframe resources realize that the laws of supply and demand cut both ways increased competition for talented mainframe resources is likely to become a catalyst for staff attrition in the coming years
3819302 the ibm mainframe is the foundation for the data center today a proven technology platform that clients are betting their entire infrastructures on
3819303 the students of today are going to be responsible for the future operations of the mainframe and it is thanks to key schools like columbus state university that students are learning a wide range of mainframe skills and gaining hands on experience to apply at those very companies that need the skill sets like tsys the success of ibm tsys and columbus state is the very essence of our academic initiative for system z program
3819304 academic programs are beginning to offset anticipated mainframe talent shortages

3819316 for a lot of younger african americans the resistance of the civil rights generation to obamas candidacy signified the failure of their parents to come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle to embrace the idea that black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines long ago joined the political mainstream
3819317 the writer must maintain the fiction of a general age chasm dividing black americans or the theory on the inevitable extinction of black politics does not work
3819318 could not come to terms at the dusk of their lives with the success of their own struggle
3819319 the generational transition that is reordering black politics didnt start this year it has been happening gradually and quietly for at least a decade as younger african americans barack obama among them have challenged their elders in traditionally black districts what this years democratic nomination fight did was to accelerate that transition
3819320 several black operatives and politicians with whom i spoke worried eloquently that an obama presidency might actually leave black americans less well represented in washington rather than more so that in fact the end of black politics if that is what we are witnessing might also mean the precipitous decline of black influence
3819321 the argument here is that a president obama closely watched for signs of parochialism or racial resentment would have less maneuvering room to champion spending on the urban poor say or to challenge racial injustice whats more his very presence in the rose garden might undermine the already tenuous case for affirmative action in hiring and school admissions

3819334 the top advertisers already get that cables got a co lead role in their tv plans but i think whats shining a light on the growth of iconic programming makes it all a stronger play when they are getting their sales force pumped up for the coverage and the overall power of the brand
3819335 this years weak economy has resulted in extremely volatile ad markets with major advertisers scrambling to allocate budgets where they will get the most bang for the buck

3819352 thinness still has upper hand in advertising a new study suggests that seeing skinny women in ads makes women feel worse about their personal body image but better about the brands advertised online
3819353 we feel the star is paying the price for johnston presss greedy spending spree over the last few years and bad decisions taken by senior management
3819354 the company relies on the goodwill loyalty and dedication of its staff who earn meagre salaries well below the national average wage
3819355 our staff have put in many dedicated years of service around the clock and this is how they are repaid
3819356 we believe the way to sell more newspapers is to invest in editorial content rather than employ a skeleton staff and we will fight these cuts
3819357 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3819358 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3819359 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3819360 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3819361 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3819362 if it ended up crooked i would just shave it off
3819363 one day i thought if ive got this issue other guys have to have the same problem
3819364 at first we started with play doh she would literally mold it over my face
3819365 then we graduated to plaster there were times i would literally have only a small hole to breathe through
3819366 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3819367 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3819368 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3819369 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3819370 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3819371 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3819372 all the news you never knew you needed to know until now
3819373 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3819374 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3819375 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3819376 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3819377 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3819378 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3819379 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3819380 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3819381 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3819382 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3819383 the printing press in upper mounts in northampton is used by 39 other johnston press titles printing more than one million copies a week
3819384 following a detailed review of the printing press operations within johnston press it is proposed to close the printing operation in northampton and to reduce the printing operation in peterborough
3819385 in the event this proposal goes ahead the company will endeavour to minimise the impact of the proposal through voluntary redundancy and by re deployment to alternative positions within the company and the jp group
3819386 as well as enabling efficiency gains to be realised across the group these proposals also mark a significant strategic shift in our publishing strategy
3819387 the company remains totally committed to providing readers with highly relevant local content delivered in a range of print and digital formats when and where they want it and these proposals are consistent with this objective
3819388 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3819389 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3819390 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3819391 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3819392 our members in johnston press want to produce high quality local papers but they are finding they have to work incredibly long hours sometimes dangerously long hours in order to do so

3819398 regretfully the proposals put at risk of redundancy up to 30 posts in these areas and we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3819399 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment

3819409 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air we know weve been told that
3819410 they made the decision friday and word got to me this last weekend

3819418 its definitely not easy cruising to the chase right now
3819419 we know that were on the envelope of getting in
3819420 were in that eighth through 13th class thats going to fight right down to richmond unless one of us breaks out gets a win a couple of top fives and locks ourselves in the next two races
3819421 weve had a legacy of having really fast cars i think of having generally pretty good engines and better than average luck there
3819422 the thing i love about michigan is you can race as hard as you want
3819423 you can go two and three wide on that downforce racetrack for the win and be able to do that in a cautious manner where youre going to get a good finish
3819424 to run two feet off the wall at michigan is id like to say a dangerous line because one little mistake and it wipes the right side of the car off
3819425 greg should certainly be ok given the mix of races weve got left
3819426 but man weve got to miss the wreck and we cant have a part that breaks who gets in will be more determined by things gone wrong than it will by blinding speed
3819427 we won six races in 2005 and it just kind of slips away from your fingers and you dont ever really know what you did wrong or what happened just enjoy it while you can
3819428 i want to be the best i can be and be prepared to give a run at the title

3819442 i got some pain over here if you need some
3819443 many of us in the technology community have done a poor job of communicating to the general public why they should care about these issues with geekpac we hope to change that by driving thought leadership in this area and building a critical mass of concerned citizens who will be able to get the attention of their local politicians
3819444 most or all of microsofts client side applications are affected or patched
3819445 this is the largest update in 2008 and the largest in the last 18 months we have two that we know have been exploited and four zero days
3819446 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3819447 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3819448 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3819449 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3819450 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3819451 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else
3819452 so any reduction in outlook might be viewed as disappointing

3819459 this is a big deal its a real honor for the whole country theres an amazing energy in china for this event
3819460 i think what was really nice was that the mayor placed my segment on top of the ancient wall and then i came down the stairs
3819461 having the chance to be on the wall and identify with the heritage and everything else was really nice
3819462 it couldnt be better than to have your kids screaming and taking pictures
3819463 i didnt find out until they sent me a letter asking for my shoe size and shirt size
3819464 and then the list was published on the internet by each olympic committee and thats when i saw my name and it was the only foreign name on there
3819465 these sites are being destroyed left and right especially in asia where theres been a lot of growth so they just wipe them out
3819466 a lot of them just dont realize that their grandkids could be making thousands of dollars on this type of thing
3819467 if you take advantage of one of these sites and develop it responsibly youre going to be bringing thousands of people out of poverty
3819468 we try to set up a financial trust thats sustainable and more money keeps going into it to keep things going
3819469 its a coal mining region in china it had a wall around it and it was a poor place in the middle of nowhere
3819470 they come in on a bus and they leave they maybe eat and throw away their garbage and go to the restroom that costs money for the town this region is getting destroyed
3819471 were trying to get the local business people to be the owners of the site we fund capacity building training and planning and help them on initial conservation work
3819472 local people really give us the fuel to accomplish the mission and do 12 projects at the same time
3819473 i think heritage conservation is fairly new on an international level some smaller people have been doing it for a while but in terms of peoples minds its pretty new
3819474 we really want to i think emphasize the importance of these sites in the world and in the big picture
3819475 also the sites are nonrenewable a forest can grow back but sites cant once theyre gone theyre gone forever and were losing them on our watch right now
3819476 the problem was that he did not disclose his association with the case that seems like pertinent information the fact that almost every other site reporting on this matter do not disclose this and position duffy as totally unbiased to this issue is telling
3819477 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3819478 who is this guy and what is his affilitation with the issue s
3819479 its up to the readers and others to do the research and figure it out
3819480 really you honestly think that theres no ethical questions in not disclosing a conflict of interest i just dont see how that is perhaps its because i deal with plenty of writers who know that the most fundamental point is to disclose any potential conflicts
3819481 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3819482 well our intended audience should know were biased so we dont need to disclose conflicts of interest
3819483 what was not clear was his active participation in a case critical to what hes commenting on

3819485 the pto s new interpretation of patentable subject matter provides a clear avenue to reject patent applications and to invalid issued patents on all patents on innovative computer implemented processes without regard to how meritorious or creative the innovation is
3819486 duffy pointed to googles pagerank patent or license rather because google is considered a great innovator and the pagerank system is considered truly inventive and unique to google duffy was not using googles name for recognition purposes he was using googles patent as an example of something deserving patent protection
3819487 actually its not most of the truly unique work for pagerank was done prior to page brins work by jon kleinberg at mit page brin simply updated his work in a rather marginal way
3819488 well if most of our readers know this conflict theres no reason to disclose

3819505 dieser vertrag wird so weit reichende ma nahmen zur opferhilfe wie bisher kein anderer internationaler vertrag enthalten dadurch soll auch die r umung der blindg nger und die unterst tzung der opfer im libanon und in anderen betroffenen l ndern stark gef rdert werden
3819506 the apparent death of googles pioneering pagerank patent under the ptos new rule for patentable subject matter may be a cause for celebration among those who are philosophically opposed to property rights in innovation and are eager to confine the patent systems ambit
3819507 it will surely be cause for mourning among those who believe that allowing patents on cutting edge technologies has served the country well for more than two centuries and that a radical departure from the traditional approach would be unwise
3819508 there are some things i can talk about as a pastor i do know they had a very difficult relationship
3819509 eddie was not a violent man he didnt go over there fighting all he wanted to do was to take his and my sons fishing
3819510 he wanted to take his six year old son aaron with him too and his daddy i guess wasnt going to let him and so while he was getting his tackle box his daddy just shot him in the head
3819511 and i believe once all the facts come out that it will not be presented as some people are presenting it now
3819512 we think we have a pretty good handle on the situation we thought we were relatively conservative but well see how it goes
3819513 obviously this isnt something that we absolutely need to do but we stepped up to do it because we think its the right thing to do
3819514 it has long been seen as likely that one of the bigger telecommunications equipment players would be interested in tandberg like cisco and hewlett packard
3819515 under our expanded charter announced last year we are branching out in new directions such as power consumption while continuing to move ahead with our graphics and workstation application benchmarks
3819516 when companies and economies are under pressure people look for ways to become more productive
3819517 i think the overall industry growth will be pretty healthy i feel it is possible that dell will grow faster than the industry
3819518 i was shocked at first but once i realized it was just water it wasnt that big of a deal
3819519 i was going to dry off eventually i really didnt think this whole thing would be that big of a deal and im just glad everyone could get a good laugh from it all
3819520 the latest developments in hr management are about changing the way hr managers think and the questions they ask
3819521 it also is changing the way they gather process and most importantly evaluate information these developments hold the promise of helping the profession move beyond chasing fads to getting to the real work of helping their organizations improve business results through more effective management of people
3819522 do you think having an sl relationship is cheating on your rl
3819523 its not cheating if your rl partner knows about it
3819524 i hate this question because i struggle with these thoughts myself
3819525 the situation is best compared to itunes dominance of the music download business which leaves the music houses with no serious alternatives
3819526 we are seeing the effects of higher energy costs in retail data through more buying via the internet
3819527 nissan grows at lower cost gms assets more fully utilized
3819528 it would have potentially been a distraction to our current turnaround efforts and it could impede our fast moving efforts to evolve a global management team
3819529 people have discovered high levels of repeated sequences in the genomes of most higher species and spun theories about why there are so many repeats
3819530 we have been able to show with yeast that these repeated sequences allow the formation of new types of chromosomes chromosome aberrations and represent one important way of diversifying the genome
3819531 those particular differences may prove to be more successful in natural selection and eventually you may get a new species
3819532 if you have a break in this repeated part you can repair not only from the same chromosome but also from a similar repeated sequence in many other places in the genome
3819533 we expected to see primarily single base pair changes or small deletions and insertions no one expected to see that one person would have two copies of a gene while others would have one or three copies of the same gene
3819534 most solid tumors have a high level of these rearrangements as well as a high level of extra chromosomes recombination between repeated genes is clearly one way of generating rearrangements although some rearrangements also occur by other pathways
3819535 it is an evolutionary battle between normal cells and tumor cells one way that tumor cells can break free of normal cell growth regulation is to rearrange their genomes
3819536 wolavers will also be introducing a new line that highlights the local farmers they buy ingredients from the first one will be released this fall its called will stevens pumpkin ale stevens is a vermont organic pumpkin farmer and his pumpkins will be used in the recipes his picture will be on the label
3819537 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
3819538 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
3819539 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference
3819540 on the verge of exploding in the next two years
3819541 the iphone introduction has begun to cause a shakeup that is long overdue in mobileland
3819542 theres opportunity in the space between web apis and raw cloud computing
3819543 soon all youre going to need is a terminal and net connection but until then there are opportunities to build up file systems system admin services and other things we can do with web apis
3819544 about a year ago we became convinced that the rdf data model and linked data techniques offered the first pragmatic solution to the historical data silo problem of unconnected data
3819545 the only missing piece was how to bring context to that data and so we started the umbel project
3819546 the umbel project with its need to capture the open world aspects of the web has brought a fresh perspective and set of challenges to cyc
3819547 we are excited by the release and committed to supporting umbel as part of our overall web relevance strategy
3819548 we see umbel as a useful gateway to the more sophisticated reasoning and other tools surrounding cyc
3819549 the participation and responsiveness of cycorp and the cyc foundation have been absolutely essential to the quality of umbel
3819550 umbel is a major addition to the burgeoning linked data web
3819551 it provides a coherent data dictionary that meshes naturally with the dbpedia project openlink co founded nearly two years ago
3819552 this data dictionary orientation of umbel also increases the palatability of linked data to the closed world realm of enterprise data spaces reducing the pain associated with the timeless quest for data integration

3819559 the best part of beauty is that which no picture can express
3819560 dat bleek toen er gestemd werd over een voorstel om het cda agendapunt niet tijdens deze vergadering maar in de raad van januari dus na de commissievergadering te behandelen fred paap en fred henrion verpoorten stemden tegen en de andere drie vvders waren daarvoor
3819561 these sectors must be able to lure and to support the development of other businesses
3819562 een verplaatsing naar een andere locatie zou wel eens een win win situatie kunnen opleveren dan moet je zeker niet nalaten dat goed te onderzoeken
3819563 we staan open voor alle nieuwe idee n om de ruimte in noord holland zo goed mogelijk in te richten
3819564 in het verleden zijn er al diverse pogingen geweest om het circuit te verplaatsen echter telkens zonder resultaat komend jaar vieren we ons 60 jarig bestaan op deze historische locatie en als het aan ons ligt blijven we hier ook minstens de komende 60 jaar
3819565 je kunt wel stellen dat we hierdoor onaangenaam verrast zijn
3819566 this point in time from july to september is regarded as the harvest time for the apparel sector
3819567 on the back of impressive figures in july in addition to the positive outlook for the next two months it is possible for the industry to reap 9 5 billion in export revenue by the end of the year as set earlier
3819568 ntc is well known for the forward looking thought leadership with which it has served the media and entertainment industry for more than 25 years
3819569 ntcs highly collaborative thought leadership approach encompasses an unparalleled range of expertise in media and entertainment technologies ntc is providing click for the lowest price on dmnobieblank television
3819570 new consumer displays and the challenge of providing content to take advantage of advanced capabilities
3819571 during the past few years a major shift has occurred in the type of display that is considered the typical home
3819572 the role of metadata and process in the evolution of media
3819573 this is because of the commonly recognized importance of semantic metadata in effectively supporting various media related activities such as intelligent search and retrieval of media assets web
3819574 the impact of technology upon metadata collection costs courvoisier or cold duck
3819575 this paper focuses on the impact of technology on the cost of metadata
3819576 we compare these costs within representative media and entertainment workflows when using either traditional or modern file based technologies projections regarding the ongoing impact of technology upon metadata costs will also be examined
3819577 until best practices emerge this area will be subject to significant upheaval and innovation
3819578 is there room for standardization here will these technologies be applicable to other areas this papers purpose is to provide clarity to this important and evolving issue
3819579 service oriented architecture solutions have been used by it departments in banking and other fields for more than a decade
3819580 they are stable and mature and are now being leveraged to facilitate the television and media entertainment industrys transition from physical to file based technologies and workflows soa is an architectural approach that improves file based workflow efficiencies allows for easier integration of multiple software and hardware applications within a facility and provides the agility to integrate future technology advances as they become available

3819582 we look forward to this promotion with stanford blood center every year
3819583 its a great cause and the athletics department is happy to be able to support it
3819584 with approximately 20 percent of our blood supply coming from high school and college students on mobile blood drives it is important that we continue to bring in donors when school is not in session otherwise we risk facing shortages in our inventory
3819585 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
3819586 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
3819587 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run
3819588 i am delighted to take on the role of ceis director
3819589 the center has a remarkable record of fueling economic growth in new york state through industry university r amp d partnerships as director however i view this only as a foundation upon which we need to build further i look forward to sustaining our existing partnerships with new york state companies while developing and growing new ones all with a view to maximizing the positive impact on our state
3819590 theres no comparison to playing your heart out in a gym with 150 people watching to 1 500 people watching
3819591 you give that little extra because youre doing this for your fans as much as for yourself i came away from ucr loving my experience as a student athlete i want athletes playing their hearts out now to walk away with a positive experience
3819592 this university gave me my self confidence and made me feel there was nothing i couldnt do
3819593 athletics in our society get a lot of attention and can be a window into the university from the community
3819594 when we have success its easier for some people to identify with our university
3819595 you dont have to go to l a to see quality athletic events
3819596 we need to mirror the vision the institution has for itself
3819597 you can have great professors great labs and great programs if people see us as an outstanding athletics program that will positively reflect on the institution
3819598 as a division i institution the university of california riverside must field teams that are competitive providing the resources necessary to help our student athletes succeed
3819599 the association will play a significant role in making that happen by helping to raise funds and build support in the community for our teams
3819600 i am grateful for the commitment and dedication of the community leaders who have agreed to serve on the board
3819601 i am especially thankful for the leadership of amy harrison she was a star student athlete as an undergraduate here and remains an avid fan i look forward to working with the association to build on the successes of our program enhance the university experience for our student athletes and create a legacy of excellence of which we can all be proud
3819602 because of its complexity network access control technology is underutilized even though it offers organizations a stronger better way of protecting their data
3819603 verizon business has the experience and expertise to educate businesses about this technology and enable them to use it effectively
3819604 the network access control market has taken off more slowly than expected because of the overall complexity of engagements and the general immaturity of products in the market the adoption of professional services focused on nac engagements product evaluations to determine the right fit for each customers use cases and the option of adopting managed services such as those offered by verizon business will accelerate the maturation of the nac market and will create additional peace of mind for organizations adopting the technology
3819605 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3819606 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3819607 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3819608 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3819609 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3819610 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3819611 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3819612 although its more like a one two three four punch
3819613 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
3819614 in michigans efforts to re imagine how education is delivered to children online instruction will be a key component of this transformation
3819615 providing teachers with a vast reservoir of online resources will help power this educational evolution we thank verizon and the partnership michigan will have with thinkfinity org and the resources necessary to help train our teachers to learn how to use this important tool
3819616 whether its an english teacher looking for resources to spark a love of reading in a student or a parent seeking a convenient and user friendly educational activity to stimulate the mind of a young child thinkfinity org will help them quickly and easily find the information needed to improve student achievement
3819617 por aquilo que conseguimos perceber eles vieram com o objectivo espec fico de destruir todas as instala es militares dos georgianos
3819618 estamos muito preocupados com informa es segundo as quais as for as russas entraram e assumiram posi es na cidade portu ria de poti e de que ve culos blindados est o a impedir o acesso ao porto e de que a r ssia est a fazer explodir vasos de guerra georgianos
3819619 estou convencido que portugal estaria bem pior se a ac o governativa n o tivesse demonstrado o zelo a compet ncia e a coragem que demonstrou
3819620 bartlett was the first person to prepare a compound of a so called inert or noble gas
3819621 for that action he deserved a nobel prize although it was never awarded to him he will forever be recognized as a genius by the scientific community for the logical and imaginative procedure he used in that preparation
3819622 the same ingenuity characterized his experimentation in other aspects of inorganic chemistry in department seminars he often enlivened discussions with his thoughtful comments much as did g n lewis in the early 20th century his colleagues will greatly miss the pleasure of his companionship and good humor
3819623 spurred by bartletts success other scientists soon began to make new compounds from xenon radon and krypton with bartletts simple experiment the old law of the unreactivity of the noble gases had disappeared
3819624 the manager has made some great signings i never realised before how good deco is
3819625 i played against him four or five times in the past and hes probably one of the best ive ever trained with or played against
3819626 he looks awesome he has a great touch opens up defences and can pass the ball
3819627 he gets stuck in as well which i like about him
3819628 he makes it look so easy and is a class act when you see him day in day out you realise how determined he is
3819629 things havent gone too well for him over the last couple of years and he wants to prove himself theres no better place to do that than at chelsea
3819630 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3819631 i was a russian major with no experience teaching and got there and all of the sudden 60 kids were dumped in my lap
3819632 i was asked to be in charge of curriculum and recruiting volunteers
3819633 i think a lot of americans go abroad thinking just by virtue of the fact that you are american and have a college education that youll know theyll be some way for you to help out abroad but thats not necessarily true
3819634 i think a lot of development work takes highly trained professionals
3819635 how do you make it a two way street instead of following the same old one way west to the rest kind of model
3819636 we need other human beings and other cultures to supplement our knowledge
3819637 its almost a joke now in the ngo world and the service world that these students come and theyre trying to pad their resumes
3819638 once you have that recognition that one needs something from the outer world from other people from other cultures then and only then do you have the capacity to actually be of service to anyone else
3819639 a huge part of our mission and philosophy is to make sure that were only doing projects that the community has requested
3819640 its really important that we dont impose any of our ideals on them we just want to make sure were helping them in a way that they see they need help
3819641 i think volunteers will tell you that as great as the experience was and as much as we felt like we accomplished they always feel like they got more out of it then they were able to give
3819642 with all this focus on volunteering abroad it takes focus away from needs of communities in united states
3819643 what is it that makes the people in a small village in tonga more deserving than people in the ghettos in new orleans that have been left out
3819644 the goals of such programs need to be very very very clear the communities in which these volunteers are placed need to have an absolute first say they need to be part of how these things are designed they can have an absolute say in how this volunteer experience should be structured to benefit all people involved
3819645 in building these projects and creating these programs were not just there giving handouts were fully engaging communities in cameroon and were also engaging our communities in the united states
3819646 i think its probably pretty rare that you graduate from college and your first job provides you with real concrete positive results and feedback
3819647 its really focused on education its focused on local voices its focused on local participation and local leadership and i think thats really the best strategy you can take in a short term program
3819648 one of the 14 girls who will compete on the new season of americas next top model is transgender
3819649 yesterday i heard sen mccain say we are all georgians now well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3819650 we should realize what is at stake here for americans
3819651 me and my brothers mentioned elections once when we were saying that we should help get a black man to the office
3819652 our granny told us not to let my mom in the house when she was doing drugs shed knock on the door asking us to let her in and we couldnt it was tearing me up inside
3819653 i cant do or sell drugs because of my mom
3819654 me and my brothers never talk about politics we dont know when to vote or where to vote
3819655 we have to get more sports programs in our schools it is the only reason middle school kids go to school we need more funding for our schools and we need more financial aid for those who are considering college
3819656 you gotta go where kids are gyms community centers schools block parties with music would be best
3819657 i am worried about the instability of our economy will i have a job when i graduate
3819658 many youth vote organizations are too fixated on college student organizing
3819659 new voters need to be told over and over and over again about voting we partnered up with local djs in chicago and la and it worked they are local they have a relationship they are trusted leaders and they repeat the same message
3819660 these young people are some of the most cynical skeptical and distrustful people in this country when it comes to our democracy
3819661 the issue is more about not being fixated enough on non college organizing college campuses will always be fertile areas for organizing we need to continue to invest there but we need to expand the work to all post secondary institutions especially community colleges technical schools and art institutes etc
3819662 as a collective we will carry out some nationally coordinated efforts designed specifically to reach engage and project the voices of non college youth we will organize around issues of particular concern to non college youths such as jobs criminal justice system reform and health care access members are also building a range of cultural and new media strategies to engage non college youth
3819663 the situation today is nothing like the cold war times
3819664 nobody has a good idea of what is to be done
3819665 as we age hormone secretion and cell responsiveness decrease possibly due to loss of cell membrane fluidity or alteration of the membrane
3819666 animal studies have shown that omega 3 fatty acids may help hormone signals get into cells whose cell membrane has been stiffened by age
3819667 it is a clear indication that western representatives are gaining influence in international go affairs
3819668 some in the press driven by racism criticize obama unfairly
3819669 i would appreciate it if one person on this boat would not assume im an evil lecherous hump
3819670 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3819671 as a black man barrack can get shot going to a gas station
3819672 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
3819673 it is the finding of this court that the defendant does not have a dangerous mental disorder and is no longer mentally ill
3819674 the state has not met its burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence that the defendant should be retained
3819675 susan mooney is in better mental health than the majority of people walking up and down the street
3819676 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit
3819677 but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out ok were happy now
3819678 going to come out here for the kids birthdays it will be the first time the cousins meet
3819679 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3819680 it is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3819681 but this is the first time that a study really gives the cold hard facts
3819682 when people dont have good jobs to support families i think that leads to depression and anxiety which in tern leads to substance abuse
3819683 substance abuse not only drains the resources of a family it drains the resources of a community
3819684 there is nothing wrong with someone making fun of their own ethnic group
3819685 its very troubling what we have to do is search out the answers
3819686 if we did wed be all over it well know more when the state police finish their investigation and well see where that leads us
3819687 weve had such a focus on forensics it tends not to get as much attention
3819688 its not designed necessarily for the type of treatment we do
3819689 there are nooks and crannies you have to trust staff to not do this sort of thing and basically they dont so when there is a staff person who is errant and wants to find a chance to misbehave sooner or later they can manage to do so
3819690 working with world leaders for the next 8 to 10 years
3819691 i am going to win and i will be re elected and there is nothing you can do about it
3819692 i am not opposed to nuclear power and expect to see some modest increased use of nuclear reactors
3819693 everytime people have had to wait for police people have been killed or wounded by the dozen
3819694 across the european union the average cost of a gallon of gas runs to about 8
3819695 impacts of increased access to oil and natural gas resources in the lower 48 federal outer continental shelf ocs
3819696 it is our understanding that although cuba has leased out exploration blocks 60 miles off the coast of southern florida which is closer than american firms are allowed to operate in that area no chinese firm is drilling there
3819697 you wont take it off the table as an option
3819698 i aint taking it off the table which tells me he might not start shutting them down
3819699 while we are confident in our safety protocols and procedures we are reviewing them to determine if there are other steps or policies that can be implemented that go beyond the existing standards to better detect prevent or deter these types of events in the future
3819700 there has never been a tool published a set of questions to ask a blood test to run there has never been an instrument or a tool to predict who will kill themselves and who wouldnt
3819701 its not surprising at all considering what happened to our son
3819702 the system just failed him whatever the systems supposed to be
3819703 it was an unprecedented act on the senators part and the result speaks for itself
3819704 large investor decided to pay a few bucks to a senator in new york to force the issue
3819705 and do remember that there are many investment bankers located in new york making them pretty influential constituents of sen schumer
3819706 where has he been and bo welcome to national politics you are playing with the big boys now and theres no crying in campaigning
3819707 leipheimer is the first utah athlete to win a medal at the beijing games

3819710 it would take 10 years to get the oil and it is only six months worth
3819711 of the people for the people and by the people
3819712 this legislation builds on the energy oceans and biofuels bills passed this session all positioning massachusetts as the clear national leader in creating a clean energy economy
3819713 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change and at the same time stimulate development of the technologies and the companies that will move us into the clean energy age of the future
3819714 massachusetts is leading the way in comprehensive energy reform and all of this sessions accomplishments from green communities and advanced biofuels standards to global warming solutions and now green jobs incentives make us the envy of the nation
3819715 this law will help us create good paying jobs in an already thriving clean energy industry that can double or triple in size in the coming years because of our hard work
3819716 these initiatives show that massachusetts is serious about the future of our environment and our economy
3819717 promoting our emerging clean energy sector will create jobs and boost an industry that will work to reach the goals of the global warming solutions act by focusing on these green collar jobs as well as the reduction of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions we will help to ensure a healthier future for massachusetts
3819718 with passage of the most progressive global warming bill in the nation massachusetts has positioned itself as a leader in the clean and renewable energy sector and secured its position in the emerging green economy
3819719 the legislatures approval of the global warming solutions act was an historic moment that will revolutionize the commonwealths future economy by spurring job growth sparking innovation and protecting our environment for future generations im extremely pleased that we were able to take swift action now the cost of inaction was just too great
3819720 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3819721 the language in there is so similar to the language in the left behind books
3819722 and installing the kingdom of god on earth while expunging all evil once and for all
3819723 when you can get away with something you go ahead and do it its human nature
3819724 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3819725 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3819726 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
