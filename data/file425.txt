4250316 the whole os and almost every application looks and feels the same as if a single team developed the whole thing thanks to apple hi guidelines
4250317 mac os global menubar is better because of fitts law
4250318 well the clothes dont fit me anymore and the storage for them was costing me the price of a second mortgage
4250319 both liz amp bill bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the job
4250320 i am confident that their leadership will help further our efforts to provide the highest level of service to the public and protection for the environment
4250321 study study study i want to learn so i can take care of myself and i want to live where i am not in fear of being taken or killed every day
4250322 i think he barry showed in the second minute what he can do and thats what the celebration was about we love gareth we want him to stay and hopefully he does
4250323 we just try to get on with it if gareths there im happy if hes not there one day i will be disappointed but good luck to him
4250324 its good obviously its my first game back and i wasnt even expected to be training until next week so ive done well to come in
4250325 they didnt really make it easy for us by any means these games can be hard when you dont really know much about the opposition
4250326 i think hes been a victim of a board thats come in given him a lot of money and wanted success immediately
4250327 he spent the money and unfortunately what he spent it on didnt bear fruit thats not his fault
4250328 it was just bad luck with injuries i think hes got to be judged on what happens from now
4250329 somebodys got to be the favourite to get the sack first and unfortunately its him because of the demand at west ham for success
4250330 but the odds on him going will soon change if we stick two or three quick wins together
4250331 its a slow process and youve got to build a foundation matthew upson summed it up the other day you cant just buy success in one season it takes time
4250332 time stood still for us for a year because everyone we tried to bring in in terms of knowledge and experience was injured
4250333 theres a determination to go where we wanted to go last season before it went wrong it was a frustrating season
4250334 all the impact players we bought to change games were always on the treatment table which was frustrating for everybody
4250335 you want your biggest weapons out there because you know at any stage of the game kieron dyer or craig bellamys pace could get you a goal
4250336 i think theres been less activity in the market this northern summer because were yet to see our transfers from last year play their part
4250337 if you look at the games theyve played collectively theres not even a season between them
4250338 if they play 20 games each this season there will be a completely different outcome
4250339 having them back alongside dean ashton and scott parker will be like new signings
4250340 its something he agreed with west ham hes a great player but obviously something wasnt right nobody knows what happened
4250341 im very happy here the people treat me very well my first option was to continue with valencia
4250342 for me family comes first they have always helped me with everything it is important that they are very well like me
4250343 we have a good team there are not many signings this year but we hope to recover players for the squad because last season was difficult we are in the uefa cup we are thinking of the league and we hope to have some very good times
4250344 well over the last few years mccains views on russia seem to be getting more and more confrontational and i think hes really aligned himself with the far right not with the centrists within the republican party and in some ways it almost appears either if he thinks the cold war is still on or that he wants it to return
4250345 i think its arguably dangerous in the sense that by assuming that russia may be more aggressive than it is and by pushing russias back up against the wall its possible that one can produce a self fulfilling prophecy
4250346 mccains stance on russia has been consistent and it has brought many admirers to his side other americans who also believe that the russian bear is best kept on a short leash
4250347 if blair were to go wobbly if he were to begin to say its time for us to begin to head for the exits that would certainly increase the pressure on bush to follow suit

4250350 looking at the other ktla poll results im not surprised
4250351 fpteditors well i think the thing that people need to realize is that engineers know that once you
4250352 hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters

4250375 dar una herramienta m s al juez que muchas veces pese a su ntima convicci n debe ceder ante el r gimen legal es una forma de tornar m s estrictos ciertos beneficios que se conceden a los procesados y no con intenci n de menoscabar sus derechos y garant as sino como una forma de privilegiar la seguridad p blica

4250388 why are so few chinook returning to some clayoquot sound rivers
4250389 we cant make any more music unless we live but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from the black parade when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
4250390 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible

4250394 so the twisted christmas a musical is a combination of the christmas album the new album which will have new metal songs on it and the best of twisted sister throughout history its early on but ive finished the script
4250395 it tells a story but its very much a concert event
4250396 growing up i felt unattractive short and self conscious about my body and i would purposely emphasise that by doing odd things
4250397 i wore glasses braces odd hairdos and dumpy clothes when i was a freshman i wore a christmas tree skirt as a cape i couldnt get any dates until senior year
4250398 it happened when we were shooting at night and i walked off the set rode a boat on the chao phraya river back to the hotel woke up my wife and our little son kal el and my father in law drove them to the airport and got on a plane to korea with them dropped them off hopped on another plane and flew back to thailand to report to the set that next night
4250399 before the coup someone from the kings cabinet had given me a shirt bearing the kings emblem if youre wearing that emblem youre 100 per cent safe
4250400 so when the coup went down i knew it was time to put on that shirt it was like a cloak of invincibility
4250401 if people call me a lesbian because i have short hair and i wear jeans instead of dresses then by all means run with it i think its hilarious i like guys

4250414 women may be physiologically at higher risk for injection site reactions due to typically higher gluteal fat thickness
4250415 is not a standard needle it is not possible to substitute a standard needle
4250416 we allow favouritism to the rich no capital gains tax etc when the disparity between the rich and the poor is dangerously wide
4250417 the smartest thing any kiwi can do is party vote green its not about being scared its about being smart
4250418 i have smacked my kids once or twice and wished that i hadnt
4250419 i dont regard osama bin laden as a bogeyman by now hes long dead anyway of kidney failure so he wont be coming here any time
4250420 to accuse the greens of responsibility for arming our police is a ridiculous flight of fancy
4250421 many households have access to very little financial insight in most cases the only financial professionals they come into contact with are trying to sell them something whether its a mortgage or a stock independent financial advisers who provide more comprehensive advice have typically been available only to the relatively wealthy
4250422 theres another more urgent reason to focus on the idea of social contagion today like booms many busts are magnified by group thinking and once busts become severe enough they prompt changes in the national mood that ramify well beyond economic affairs benjamin m friedman in his 2005 book the moral consequences of economic growth cites abundant historical evidence that when economic prospects look bleak especially for long periods of time intolerance racism and other reactionary impulses flourish as more people experience hardship trust between them tends to diminish and the social fabric itself seems to fray
4250423 i get sick and tired of people criticising environmentalists which is good criticism is healthy but not offering any alternatives
4250424 there is a not insignificant and growing group of people who think the way that we greens do
4250425 if i really said what i thought about that comment of yours it would not pass moderation as far as i am concerned you are beneath contempt
4250426 set the minimum wage at 66 of the average wage
4250427 hence we should be scared because socialism and nanny state have taken over new zealand
4250428 i would like to have the option of properly disciplining my children pain is a very good sender of messages why else dont you put your hand on the oven
4250429 hence we should be scared because socialism and nanny state have taken over new zealand
4250430 the only thing that means anything to these people is force
4250431 and you want reinforce that belief by cracking down on them
4250432 vast majority of the people living in low socio economic areas who are are good people
4250433 your way of group hugs and nice we chats has not worked at all
4250434 again you shoot down suggestion without coming up without your own answer
4250435 why is it so hard for you to admit that your way has not worked
4250436 sorry dont have any new ideas just tired old tried and tested ones
4250437 capitalism is still a part of most forms or anarchist thought including anarcho syndicalism all organic forms of society utilise capitalism to atleast some degree infact even the anarcho communalist societies of the san which marx based alot of his arguements on utilised somewhat primitive forms of capitalism though granted they were much closer to mechanical societies than organic societies and as a consequence were by neccesity small
4250438 the thing i liked about it was the support of small business as it is i pay a fortune in tax and get next to nothing for it they take take take
4250439 i advocate a complete restructuring of society based on cooperation responsibility and democracy and the removal of capitalism violence and hierarchy
4250440 by organic and mechanical i refer to the interactions between individuals and small units the terms although contrary to intuition refer not to how the interactions form but how the units work together it is part of the sociological theory espoused by durkheim his work is well worth a read
4250441 but i dont beleive them to be free of capitalism
4250442 i define capitalism as the economist does that is to say i define it as people specialising in areas where they have comparitave advantage and participating in trade with others a system where both are more productive than if they did all themselves
4250443 from metaphysics i went to ethics and found that the justification of the existing conditions of society was not easy
4250444 in the long run the earnings of each agent of production are as a rule sufficient only to recompense the sum total of the efforts and sacrifices required to produce them with a partial exception in the case of land especially much land in old countries if we could trace its record back to their earliest origins but the attempt would raise controversial questions in history and ethics as well as in economics and the aims of our present inquiry are prospective rather than retrospective
4250445 when a workman is in fear of hunger his need of money is very great and if at starting he gets the worst of the bargaining it remains great that is all the more probably because while the advantage in bargaining is likely to be pretty well distributed between the two sides of a market for commodities it is more often on the side of the buyers than on that of the sellers in a market for labour
4250446 people who murder shopkeepers old ladies and mothers in front of their children are worthless scum and should be removed from society
4250447 ideologically increasing an understanding of how reprehensible socialism is and how dangerouis it is to promote high levels of centralised control as a source of happiness particularly when you preach it to people who have no real possibility of attaining it other than by crime or by screwing other people would be a good start
4250448 the shootout has proved to be an exciting addition to hockey at a variety of levels and we are anxious to bring it into college hockey the drama it creates is very popular with fans and importantly todays players love it
4250449 at the same time the ncaa rules and ice hockey committees have allowed us to implement this tie breaker protocol so that every regular season league game will have a winner while preserving the integrity of the national rankings because ccha games decided by a shootout will still be considered ties for ncaa purposes bonus points awarded will impact the conference standings only
4250450 this is a bold decision and i think its a great one
4250451 college hockey is already one of the most exciting sports in america adding the shootout just adds to the excitement
4250452 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te

4250456 everyone gathered here must want to know what the box is all about now i dont know everything but ill tell everything i know there are 2 more boxes i will have to exorcise them in the future
4250457 the people in this area tried to kill this person because he they thought they would be oppressed more for this trouble but mr aa promised that he would give the weapon if they rescued him it was the box
4250458 if we were in the same place we wouldnt have put it into practice but but ancestors did maybe the persecution at that time was as severe as such they had to arm with this box sacrificing a lot of children they made the first box after the worst talk which children they would kill and the first box hakkai was made
4250459 then villagers made the box one after another first box they made for themselves was chippou seven childrens box in two weeks 15 children and 1 woman were killed its horrible and they present the box to the landlord who oppressed them as a token of their loyalty and all the children and women in the landlords house died from the worst throes the villagers warned the landlord and all the people who discriminated them wecant forgive you but if you dont interfere us anymore we wont do anything if you revenge to what we did we will scatter the boxes all around we will continue to make the box then the landlords and people around the village accepted these conditions and the rumor spread and discrimination and persecution ceased soon
4250460 the villagers continued to make the boxes for 13 years one 11 year old boy stole the box as s played with the box it looks like a toy for poor children at that time the box might look like a very attractive toy to play with to make the matter worse it was the chippou seven childrens box the curse is strengthen with the number of the children sacrificed the boy brought the box to his home and all the children and women in the house died in one day the villagers realized the power of the box and understood that it could be harmful to themselves then they decided to discard other boxes then they visited the my shrine to exorcise the boxes but my ancestor thought the curse of the box is too strong to dispel it and he thought of the way to make the curse weaker it was the way mr j told the years they have to preserve the box by turn was fixed by the power of the number 110 years for one childs box and 140 years for seven childrens box and so on and 13 boxed were distributed to the groups
4250461 spray and pray charge everybody lets go speed speed speed

4250468 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the failed policies and old politics that john mccain wants to continue the focus of our convention to people back here in michigan should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4250469 america doesnt need a bigger army it needs a smaller that is more modest foreign policy one that assigns soldiers missions that are consistent with their capabilities modesty implies giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the cold war and then 9 11 gave rise it also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions when it comes to supporting the troops here lies the essence of a citizens obligation
4250470 all these so called nontraditional capabilities have moved into the mainstream of military thinking planning and strategy where they must stay
4250471 rumsfelds dismal strategic decisions resulted in the unnecessary deaths of american servicemen and women
4250472 responsible for america and her allies going to war with the wrong plan
4250473 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
4250474 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
4250475 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
4250476 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war
4250477 no other human activity gives it greater scope no other has such incessant and varied dealings with this intruder
4250478 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4250479 as part of the reinstatement review he was given an opportunity to submit any relevant information he would like to provide he was asked to do that by this friday if he chose to do so
4250480 i didnt do them to influence the commissioner i did them to better myself as a person
4250481 they were normally things that i have been doing besides staying out of trouble thats what im trying to do
4250482 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
4250483 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement
4250484 i didnt feel like there was a definite advantage going into tonight
4250485 when im playing well i can hopefully play with the best in the world and i do believe i proved that tonight it couldnt happen on a better stage for me hopefully the people back home appreciate the work ive done to get here

4250492 we were living at headley grange this house that led zeppelin bad company and the pretty things had lived in it was a bit of a shambles in fact theyd ripped the shit out of it we were all living together and writing together and it went very well to start with pete had said he wanted to do all the words so mike and tony had backed off and we were merrily churning out this music every time we sat down and played something good came out
4250493 several ideas for the album were presented in order for the band to exercise a democratic vote i knew mine was the strongest and i knew it would win or i knew that i could get it to win the only other idea that was seriously considered was
4250494 once the story idea had been accepted we had all these heavy arguments about writing the lyrics my argument was that there arent many novels which are written by a committee i said i think this is something that only im going to be able to get into in terms of understanding the characters and the situations i wrote indirectly about lots of my emotional experiences in the lamb and so i didnt want other people coloring it in fat there are parts of it which are almost indecipherable and very difficult which i dont think are very successful in some ways it was quite a traditional concept album it was a type of pilgrims progress but with this street character in leather jacket and jeans rael would have been called a punk at that time without all the post 76 connotations the ramones hadnt started then although the new york dolls had but they were more glam punk the lamb was looking towards west side story as a starting point

4250502 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
4250503 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality

4250517 nosotros hab amos comenzado a trabajar por el derecho a la ciudad el cual estamos empe ados en difundir y promoverlo no solamente trataremos los problemas vinculados a la vivienda en los barrios sino la vida en la ciudad que tenga un sentido m s global
4250518 si bien nosotros focalizamos en la ciudad no podemos pensar en la ciudad sin pensar en lo que pasa en las poblaciones rurales por que las crisis de las zonas rurales repercute en las ciudades porque la gente de las zonas rurales van a las ciudades y forman parte de los cinturones de pobreza
4250519 i like watching other people get gossiped about it makes me feel better

4250523 le moyne really focuses on the individual the relationships between the students and the professors are just so valuable here because it is a small school every professor here every administrator every faculty member really cares about helping us succeed and preparing you for whatever comes after college
4250524 lafayette gives me the opportunity to get to know each of my professors personally while at the same time providing me with a hands on education the most impressive aspect of the school is its ability to supplement classroom learning

4250526 the things that sets lawrence apart are the faculty and student relationships and ratios most students do tutorials a lot of one on one work with faculty the professors actually care what youre interested in and who you are

4250685 just like we have done in each of the last four seasons we are going to play some games that really jump off the schedule and make everyone around the country take notice of the longwood basketball program
4250686 playing at kentucky we have the winningest program in college basketball history that plays in arguably the best environment our game can produce
4250687 finally we will play virginia tech and virginia in back to back games in mid december these two games are especially important because they are right here in the state of virginia and give our fans an opportunity to come out and watch us compete in person against high power acc programs
4250688 all of these games serve multiple purposes for our team for the athletic department and for the university they allow us to get on the court and give the team especially the players a chance to experience playing in the games greatest and most energetic environments this part of the schedule also allows us to get out there and show the world of college athletics that we have put together a division i program here at longwood that is competitive respected and deserving of being treated as such
4250689 playing in this years las vegas invitational will be another great experience for us
4250690 besides the two road games against west virginia and kentucky we get two neutral site games in a tournament format in las vegas this is a first class event played in a first class arena that we had success in two years ago
4250691 the two home games against james madison and george washington are significant for us
4250692 first of all it is difficult to get teams of this stature to come to farmville and play against us especially when you have played well against them in the past secondly once you begin to establish some home court advantage by winning games it becomes tougher to get anyone at all to come here that doesnt have to with our 21 15 record in the friendly confines of willett hall over the last three years we have begun to show people that coming to longwood is going to be a difficult game as a result there is a lot of work that goes into securing these types of games and were pleased that we can get them in here to play against us
4250693 the rest of the schedule really fits together well this year in that we have been able to balance our number of home and road games for the first time
4250694 we have also been able to put together a fairly regular schedule in january and february for the first time one that will actually resemble what a league schedule would look like this should give our schedule a nice flow during a time period that you want to be playing your best basketball as we have traditionally done toward the end of the season
4250695 customers will buy from you through experience you provide them make the experience as pleasurable as possible and they will keep coming back

4250740 our data just didnt fit the current model of damage accumulation and so we had to consider the alternative model of developmental drift
4250741 we found a normal developmental program that works in young animals but becomes unbalanced as the worm gets older
4250742 it accounts for the lions share of molecular differences between young and old worms
4250743 but then how do you explain animals that dont age
4250744 a free radical doesnt care if its in a human cell or a worm cell
4250745 the take home message is that aging can be slowed and managed by manipulating signaling circuits within cells

4250758 barack obama thinks middle class tax cuts are a very important part of his overall strategy to relieve the squeeze on middle class families
4250759 he also thinks its very important to pay for that proposal to pay for all of his other spending proposals to bring down the deficit from where it is this year and to bring down the deficit from where it would be if we stayed on the current policy course
4250760 as you look ahead a few years into the future youre going to see more and more families being pushed into tax increases by that plan

4250792 i just had to share something that came up today and it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach so heres the visual two paparazzi come up out of nowhere like usual and start throwing questions at me one of them being hey lindsay what do you have to say about people commenting on your sisters implants wow did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a paedophile
4250793 i was caught out of nowhere so i didnt really come up with the proper response at the time theres many other things that i felt like saying but why give it to a random guy with a camera so that he can make money
4250794 all i am trying to say is is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4250795 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye

4250853 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
4250854 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

4250893 the justice league of america just had an opening and we thought of you
4250894 i am on cloud nine since ive gotten the gold
4250895 i was so nervous it was my first olympics and i wanted to really perform well because i had three other guys that were depending on me to swim fast but all the preparation all the training that ive done prepared me for it
4250896 i had cpr done and i came back and i was like whats next it didnt even faze me
4250897 i was devastated to see that blacks and hispanics are almost three times more likely to drown than their counterparts
4250898 to think back to my story when i was 5 i could have easily been added to the number
4250899 i think during two hours we will take control of gori and we will control gori for cleaning the gori from russians from ossetians and some other criminals
4250900 we give them possibility to let them leave this territory
4250901 if the american president can take baghdad then why cant the russians take tbilisi
4250902 were hearing an awful lot about the south ossetian forces and how theyre acting as the russians have come south into georgia
4250903 the russian forces will come down and theyll have these paramilitary troops behind them in a variety of uniforms some of them are wearing russian uniforms some of them are wearing uniforms that theyve purchased from somewhere some are wearing american uniforms
4250904 and theyll just come into the towns after the russians have swept through and theyll be looting killing and burning the towns down to the ground and its incredibly incredibly dangerous there for the civilian population
4250905 white northerners had a rather complacent and self satisfied attitude that anti black prejudice and anti black violence in particular was largely a southern problem and one of the really shocking things about the well publicized springfield race riot and its association with abraham lincoln was that the north had a race problem
4250906 they clearly wanted to mete out lethal justice there on the spot
4250907 went from one end to the other looting homes damaging homes and ultimately setting them on fire by the time they were through theyd displaced at least 40 families
4250908 largely working class rioters were expressing resentment over visible black success and influence in the community
4250909 from the perspective of many springfield residents who were white justice was not done in the end
4250910 liberals in the north were so outraged by the symbolism of this violence occurring in lincolns hometown that they got together called a series of meetings and announced their intent on lincolns birthday in 1909 to form a new organization whose prime initial goal would be to fight anti black violence
4250911 and the naacp was formally organized less than a year after that
4250912 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4250913 democrats win the state when they hold down gop margins in rural districts and appeal to swing women voters in larimer county and the denver suburbs

4250921 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking
4250922 every game i watch theres a bat splintered im sensitive about it and we need to move ahead
4250923 i thought we had forever solved the problem and we had everything we did worked but we may put an additional safeguard in
4250924 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4250925 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4250926 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4250927 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4250928 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
4250929 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
4250930 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear

4251007 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4251008 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4251009 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4251010 the united states of america stands strongly as the president of france just said for the territorial integrity of georgia
4251011 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4251012 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4251013 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4251014 we are cleaning roads because we have information that there are some mines
4251015 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4251016 we noticed when he was probably a year old that when he looked at things he kind of cocked his head back and tilted and looked
4251017 he cant see straight ahead unless its right up on him so we try to watch out for him
4251018 when he first came around we were a little hesitant about playing him from a safety standpoint but his dad felt real comfortable with him and from that point we just i let him go
4251019 the coaches figured a position for austin is defensive nose tackle
4251020 he can get in with his peripheral vision when hes right next to the ball on the defensive side once he sees the ball move he fills the gap hes developed his other senses i think his hearing is really good with that and he can follow where the sounds going so i think thats a big part of it
4251021 he wanted a scooter a few years ago we allowed him to get it
4251022 i just have aaron or someone in front so i dont hit anything
4251023 hes a big inspiration to the team theres a lot of times they start complaining about stuff and all weve got to do is point out austin and he cant see so theres no reason for them to feel sorry for themselves

4251028 my duties are vast and numerous to be perfectly honest with you i am all over the fairgrounds meeting folks
4251029 this is the most tremendous fair in the country you know its the 104th kentucky state fair i think its one of the biggest in the nation its certainly the best in the nation and it really shows off agriculture in kentucky and puts the emphasis where it belongs on the family farm
4251030 it gives an opportunity for the folks in agriculture to show their wares so to speak its kind of like we talk about basketball but you know the kids that show livestock all year this is their state tournament or their ncaa or their olympics
4251031 but during the state fair we will swell to 1 200 to 1 500 so were hiring well over 1 000 people
4251032 you know i like pork chops i like rib eyes and i like chicken
4251033 oh i love them all you know whatevers on the plate just bring it on bring it on
4251034 check root bootarg cat proc cmdline or missing modules devices cat proc modules ls dev alert dev disk by uuid 294c82a0 3ef7 40c4 917b 6c213ed85916 does not exist dropping to a shell
4251035 we thought this would be a great way for someone to buy the store outright
4251036 ive got a lot of family and friends coming down its three hours from my hometown across the bay from where i played college the area is very special to me
4251037 i dont think i have anything to prove to them
4251038 id like to throw a couple touchdowns for sure but i just want to play well i want our offense to be able to move the ball and be consistent well see what happens
4251039 he had as good a workout that ive seen from a college quarterback
4251040 he made all the throws that day particularly ones rolling to his left and throwing across his body he had a great workout
4251041 he was one of three guys that was going to be picked with the first pick in the draft i think that in itself says a lot
4251042 i think its bigger than all of us im a big believer things happen for a reason
4251043 he came to green bay for a reason i think his path when its all said and done will be the best path for him and im glad hes our quarterback
4251044 i can run full speed i can cut i can do everything
4251045 if this were the regular season i could go it bothers me only to the point where its ouch but its not something like i cant go nothing major
4251046 its just a matter of not turning it into something big i could have played monday i could play saturday but why i think thats the big picture the regular season theres no reason to risk missing any games
4251047 i felt fine that night i went home but thats not what its determined on when dealing with a head injury
4251048 they look at stuff that you cant necessarily feel as soon as i came to and was on the sidelines i felt fine but that didnt necessarily mean i was fine
4251049 they cant get over it the rage and its inhuman to ask them to get over it
4251050 i want aboriginal men to take more responsibility to stand up to violence against women and children
4251051 but when it is happening of course government has a responsibility to stop it its not rage thats killing these communities it is the sense of resignation that nothing can change it can change it must change
4251052 we cant minimise how we deal with violence at a personal level it requires accountability and personal responsibility on the part of perpetrators
4251053 in the communities there is still too much denial and looking away
4251054 you dont generate your own electricity why generate your own computing
4251055 is the person who does the soundbites column figuratively or literally in bed with conan obrien issue no 925 is the second issue in a row in which a witless monologue comment by obrien is highlighted as a quote of the week this is the rebirth of a trend that lapsed for a few weeks was the compiler of quotes on vacation and unable to see his or her favorite show but throughout last year obrien was probably the most quoted person in the column this would not be a problem if he were funny but he isnt god how i dread his taking over the tonight show while there are truly witty comments emanating nightly from leno ferguson stewart colbert and maher that go ignored is the columnist an old pal of obriens from holworthy hall at harvard university or maybe its some sad fat girl a cog in the aol warner time life empire who landed upon the soundbites column where she realized that she could promote the career of her beloved no matter one has to wonder what the secret deal is between obrien and sound biter
4251056 one of the most popular gifts for high school graduates this year is a gift certificate for plastic surgery apparently the gift certificate is a perfect way to tell a recent graduate that you can be anything you want to be but not with that giant honker huh how curious yet another sound bites quote culled from obriens witless insight free monologue what is this the fifth week in a row you guys act like he is mark twain when he is little better than pauley shore
4251057 no really seriously its got to end no more weekly obrien in the soundbites column hes had more than his share of space and time to win anyone over he isnt funny and the laborious set ups for those limp punchlines take up space three times the space of other quotes that could be more charitably used for actual humor please insist that the compiler of this column change the channel at 12 30 to one of obriens competitors people who really do say funny quotable things jimmy kimmel for example or craig ferguson tv personalities who are never quoted in the column
4251058 my missives decrying the inclusion of witless jokes told by conan obrien in the soundbites column seems to be having the opposite effect
4251059 i could tell you but id have to kill you
4251060 all the while i was out i kept looking at the watch and listening for my phone
4251061 he called me four times in an hour when are you coming home where are you are you on line yet did you leave the store yet it made me so nervous i just browsed and left
4251062 there are child safety experts who believe some 10 year olds are quite o k alone and others who would tell you that there are some 14 year olds they wouldnt leave alone
4251063 i know people who left their children alone when the oldest was 8 and there was a 4 year old and 6 year old
4251064 at that point youre not there to watch over them theyre left to their own devices and the perils of the world
4251065 now that weve moved to long island he calls me when he gets home from school and calls me when he wants to go to a friends house and again when he gets to the friends house
4251066 when he doesnt call when hes supposed to he gets punished he cant go out the next day
4251067 experts believe a child should be at least 12 before he is left alone and at least 15 before he can care for a younger brother or sister
4251068 children under age 12 dont have the cognitive ability to recognize risk and just as important dont have the cognitive maturity to react to the risk or accident once it happens
4251069 that concern is heightened when there are other children in the home so many injuries and deaths can be prevented by appropriate active adult supervision
4251070 the only option many parents have is to quit the job and get thrown out of their house because they cant pay the rent or have your child taken away for lack of supervision
4251071 it would bring a hidden problem out in the open which is all of the parents who leave children home alone not because they want to but because they have to
4251072 i think children let you know when theyre ready and i really think a parent needs to listen to that
4251073 if your child is home and something happens they feel that someone is there
4251074 in a non doorman building its different at that tender age they have to really develop the confidence in themselves and also feel like they have a grasp on the skills necessary to handle problems
4251075 we started by letting our son stay home for 15 or 20 minutes when he was almost 10 while my wife picked up some groceries around the corner and we worked our way up from that
4251076 hes the type of kid who will call up and ask if he can have a third cookie he has our telephone numbers and there are neighbors nearby
4251077 im so aware of how coddled this generation of children is they cant even go out and play by themselves
4251078 my husband and i wanted to build some independence and frankly i didnt want to pay for child care
4251079 we set them up in our bedroom with the tv the phone and the dog
4251080 i just let myself in and most of the time i go on the computer and play video games
4251081 we really didnt know what to do about it and we couldnt get in touch with our parents
4251082 if your uncles at the door you dont open it unless you call me

4251084 after the positive response received from the fans in mexico city last year espn is proud to bring x games back for a second time
4251085 as the x franchise continues to grow globally we truly appreciate the on going support that the people of mexico have given us and we look forward to another successful event this year
4251086 we are pleased to be associated with modelo light lala shot vans telcel and ocesa to bring the x games to mexico city after its successful mexico city debut in 2007
4251087 last year we had 30 athletes from 12 different countries and this year we will again have the most outstanding athletes in the world competing side by side with our prominent mexican athletes on top quality courses espn is excited about this opportunity to expand upon our great relationship with sports fans throughout the country
4251088 it cant hurt exposure is exposure whether it is racing or freestyle will it get a kid away from his video game and out on a bike that is the big question i do think if bmx gets good coverage and usa does well it will drive people to look into it i think the local track has the best shot to see a spike but this could sprinkle down to skateparks trails sidewalk jumping etc if you would have asked me a month ago i would not think it would have impacted much after hearing all the talk from my neighbors co workers kids and parents and my kids school etc i am amazed at the olympic hype the last few days you cant go anywhere without hearing someone talking about something they watched on the olympics shout out to bob tedesco for pushing the last 10 years to get bmx in he deserves a pat on the back for chasing the dream
4251089 i love that bmx racing will be in the olympics and i think its going to have a hugely positive affect on the freestyle side of the sport im having a party at my house on race day and all my friends are coming over to watch go mike day and go scott erwood
4251090 racing always has a positive effect on bmx as a whole first of all kids can start racing when they are four years old and the bikes allow them to really ride as opposed to freestyle bikes which are always too heavy to throw around even when they have 12 or 16 wheels so more kids get into bmx because of racing and they make really good all around riders because they have a different set of bike skills than kids that dont race i e mike aitken van homan brian foster matt beringer josh stricker etc the olympics will probably get a lot more kids interested in riding especially because the track is really good and it looks so fun to ride riders ready watch the lights
4251091 i rode push with kyle bennett and john purse before kyle hit puberty and hung out with him again this year at nora cup in vegas as a grown ass man if that dude wins an olympic gold medal ill laugh my ass off stoked any move forward for any aspect of bmx helps out the industry as a whole hopefully the magnitude of these steps forward will bring more bmx tracks into communities and in turn raise more awareness for parks and municipal funding for events that are and may eventually be in the olympics more opportunities for youngsters to get started in bmx pacing or riding parks is a pretty big deal
4251092 i think any mainstream coverage helps bring awareness to bmx i came up through racing so i would love to think that a younger rider could start out racing and then move to freestyle as many of us have maybe the olympics could spark this then again the olympics did not do much for sports like curling so who knows
4251093 racing in the olympics is awesome and can only benefit our sport as a whole
4251094 i think racing fits well with the format for the olympics i can only see this being a good thing for racing now as for freestyle i am not sure how they would fit the subjective nature of freestyle in the olympic format or if it really makes sense for freestyle to be in the olympics but even if freestyle does make it to the olympics it really doesnt bother me as long as it doesnt become gymnastics on wheels which its already getting pretty close ha ha
4251095 i think racing in the olympics can only help our
4251096 i think racing in the olympics will be good for the freestyle end of bmx as well as racing its all promoting 20 inch bikes i grew up doing both and they actually go hand in hand after a while of racing i realized that my favorite parts of it were hitting jumps and speed i just got sick of sitting in staging and getting beat by shitty riders who spent their time in the gym so hitting ramps trails street started to make more sense to me to each his own though opinions are like assholes we all have one
4251097 no disrespect to racing or the olympics but bmx freestyles aspirations have never directly been to be in the olympics it is a great platform to celebrate sport in a way that unites the world but we created bmx freestyle to do our own thing express our own definition of sport and to have the freedom to express this how we pleased not to have our opinions sanctioned by a higher power as a sport we are very happy with where we are at and the freedom we have we see the olympics as an opportunity to share this with the world not change

4251102 other studies have reported a similar relationship between ear infections and overweight we did not find evidence for the reverse hypothesis larger and heavier children were more prone to ear infections and tubes than smaller and lighter children
4251103 surprisingly we found that the single best predictor of body weight was not how much saturated fat they took in and not how often they ate high fat foods but was how much they liked high fat and sweet foods
4251104 particularly with damage to the taste system and we think this happens from ear infections
4251105 taste does have an impact on selection of food and diet
4251106 a may damage one of the nerves that carry taste information in addition ear infections can also alter taste altering taste does have an effect on the preferences for food
4251107 it certainly makes sense that variations in taste due to many factors including a history of ear infections could influence food preferences total food intake and weight
4251108 so while the link between taste buds and vulnerability to obesity is worthy of further exploration the simple fact is that the entire population is vulnerable to obesity
4251109 the major causes of the obesity epidemic reside in the obesigenic environment rather than on our tongues

4251114 the community was so supportive of our carnegie hall concert that we were able to secure full funding through private donations before the orchestra left for new york
4251115 in addition more than 500 patrons from the metroplex purchased tickets and traveled to new york to hear our debut they carried the excitement of that performance home and as a result ticket sales soared especially during the second half of the season

4251220 they risk their lives every single day it is not a comparison we run and get tired these guys get up at 5 in the morning run and get trained they are on call not knowing where they could go over seas there is no comparison

4251324 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4251325 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

4251327 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

4251329 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4251330 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4251331 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4251332 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4251333 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4251334 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4251335 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4251336 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4251337 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4251338 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4251339 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4251340 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4251341 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4251342 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4251343 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4251344 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4251345 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4251346 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4251347 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4251348 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4251349 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4251350 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4251351 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4251352 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4251353 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4251354 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4251355 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4251356 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4251357 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4251358 despilfarro de recursos que se ha hecho en un sistema que ya lleva 18 meses de vigencia y que no tiene signos de mejorar en su fracaso
4251359 que deb an aprovechar la oportunidad de informar por qu las regiones han sido tan abandonadas de por qu ha aumentado tanto la delincuencia de por qu la educaci n sigue siendo deficiente de por qu los funcionarios hospitalarios los gendarmes los profesores y en general los trabajadores ejercen sus labores en un ambiente inadecuado y de por qu los j venes tienen tan pocas oportunidades y de por qu los chilenos han aumentado el consumo de alcohol drogas entre otros tantos problemas
4251360 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4251361 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4251362 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4251363 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4251364 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4251365 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4251366 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4251367 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4251368 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4251369 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4251370 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4251371 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4251372 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4251373 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4251374 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4251375 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4251376 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4251377 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4251378 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4251379 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4251380 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4251381 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

4251389 it might be a case of murder or suicide but todi and the police had played a role behind the unnatural death

4251400 our 40 ambulances were attacked across kashmir and most them have broken windscreens seven of our ambulance drivers were hurt as well
4251401 there have been several attacks on our ambulances by the security forces
4251402 there was a rush of wounded and our doctors and paramedic staff was busy treating them when tear smoke landed inside the casualty ward
4251403 we had to stop work for some time there was a lot of inconvenience to both patients and our staff this should not happen
4251404 we were carrying two critically wounded persons in the ambulance
4251405 when we reached parimpora there was a huge procession we stopped the people cleared the way for us then the crpf persons were standing a few dozen metres away
4251406 when we were close to them they opened fire on the ambulance within seconds a few crpf men pounced on the ambulance and started hitting everybody inside they even assaulted the wounded one of the wounded died there
4251407 a stone hit ambulance driver mohammad shaban para and he was seriously injured
4251408 i am unable to do anything i am trying to stop them the men
4251409 we rushed out of the operation theatre we were frightened for our lives
4251410 the crpf men first opened fire at our ambulance and then charged in and broke the windscreens with rifle butts then they started beating us even the patient was hit
4251411 the people are infuriated and when they saw a police vehicle inside the hospital compound they attacked it the police opened fire but nobody was injured
4251412 after we got reports that an officer was there we have already taken action
4251413 we are probing every case where we received reports of excesses

4251428 just a month ago it appeared that the council was strongly considering two new hires and substantial wage increases for two other employees without objection overmyer reversed course and was crucial in his presentation to the county council his efforts today struck a perfect balance between necessity and fiscal responsibility
4251429 anytime local government can find ways to work harder for the people while trimming budgets its a good day to be a resident of that county
4251430 it appears hes trying to make up for over three years of poor decisions in one meeting
4251431 you hate to attack a guy when he does the right thing but in this case its more a matter of finally doing the right thing theres no indication hes going to step up for better government once we get past november
4251432 ive been running on tougher budget review and better communication between county departments since i entered this race to have booker co opt that message in todays meeting is flattering but forgive me for being skeptical hes had plenty of time on the council to properly manage you dont wait until the election season to get it right

4251440 the us plays a major role in one aspect of the peace process which is the rehabilitation and development of mindanao

4251443 despite the challenges usip managed to build productive relationships with both the grp and the milf helped the parties come up with creative solutions to stubborn issues of ancestral domain and started dialogue between disparate moro ethnic groups

4251448 the secrecy of the votes is most important in an electoral process in every country its simple to do that taiwan is a good example they just put curtains in polling booth

4251454 it will be better if these comelec employees who are now being made to answer criminally to divulge the candidates politicians or their middle men

4251456 in the same light the fact that there has been tampering of the figures of votes in the pcoc the most logical explanation as to the discrepancies must come from the provincial board of canvassers pboc chair radam he or she having personal knowledge of the incidents surrounding the canvassing
4251457 this she failed to do based on the foregoing reasons this commission finds probable cause to warrant the filing of information before the proper court

4251464 all the money was supposed to have been transferred to the national treasury from the pnb after the supreme court finally ruled last july 15 2003 that the money was ill gotten
4251465 that 22 million of this amount which has now grown to 34 14 million was not submitted to the national treasury despite a deed of release with quitclaim issued by pcgg four years ago
4251466 what adds insult to injury is the fact that this money which has obviously been kept out of the national treasury for litigation of pcgg cases abroad has been reportedly used for trips to singapore and the us by sabio and friends and relatives to oppose the 1 9 billion judgment of the class suit that the martial law victims had won in 1995

4251470 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4251473 also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education which empower people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions

4251480 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place

4251688 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4251689 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4251690 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the
4251691 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4251692 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4251693 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment

4251707 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4251708 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4251709 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4251710 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4251711 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4251712 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4251713 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security
4251714 on this anniversary lets make sure john mccain hears the same message tell john mccain to keep his hands off of our social security

4251775 while we all agree the protection of hectors and maui dolphins is essential bans in places that dolphins have never been seen only serves to undermine docs credibility
4251776 far too often those really responsible for major habitat destruction and species decline seem to have got away scott free
4251777 doc have found amateur fishers a much easier target when seeking to create marine conservation areas rather than concentrating on destructive bulk harvesting methods or poor land management where the real damage is done

4251800 our sales force is working on a large number of clearly identified projects which highlights the interest of potential customers in our solutions
4251801 we intend to be prudent during these uncertain economic times but we remain highly motivated to continue our strong growth and become the world leader in digital publishing solutions
4251802 the sobeys relationship expands aeroplans offering into grocery the most important everyday spend category
4251803 while this highly strategic relationship with sobeys has the potential to be as significant as our other large retail partnerships it is not expected to have a material financial impact during the ramp up period
4251804 although air travel during the quarter did not weaken we remain cautious given record fuel prices and the turbulence currently affecting the airline industry worldwide
4251805 theres been no significant impact on our profitability to date as a result of higher fuel costs and our partner airlines reactions to that
4251806 weve seen quite a bit of a chop in oil prices over the last little while and the renewed selloff today has dragged the commodity currencies down this afternoon
4251807 not only is headline inflation going to come down but the reason core inflation was a surprise was because of areas that will probably get heavily discounted as consumer spending slows
4251808 the large overall monthly gain was once again attributable to gasoline prices which jumped 4 1 per cent in the month
4251809 some relief may be in the offing on indications that gasoline prices moved lower in august though the annual rate of inflation is likely to remain above 5 5 per cent through the third quarter which will likely keep the fed wary

4251812 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the wednesday inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline
4251813 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market
4251814 people viewed the commodity headwinds as just so severe that any time you get a pullback in the commodities the market will try to make some headway
4251815 despite the jump in inflation readings for july we have rising conviction that inflation readings for august and now even september will be more favorable thanks to the sustained trend in retail gasoline and natural gas prices
4251816 the real eye opener was the jump in clothing prices
4251817 one month is hardly a trend but with import prices jumping we may be now seeing apparel adding to inflation rather than restraining it it is also a warning that we could be seeing price increases in other areas as the import cost rises spread through the economy

4251992 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree

4252014 kings arent ace magnets when you hold any two cards that arent aces the probability of one or more aces on the flop is 1 c 46 3 c 50 3 about 22 percent less than one time in four we covered that already in the column ace magnets in poker player vol 9 issue 15 p 14 january 23 2006
4252015 its true that having aces on the table reduces the likelihood that anyone else will have aces however its not zero with three aces among the five cards on the table the odds against an ace among the eighteen cards dealt to your nine opponents are 3 to 2 exactly 60 percent

4252041 it has taken some time to work our way through it

4252046 the real bear in the woods was not the greening of the government
4252047 the real bear in the woods was the maturing of consumer preferences and the concern with potential exposures to those chemicals that are perceived to cause harm
4252048 theyre much more stringent in ensuring these products meet some kind of third party certification with regard to green credentials
4252049 i think that oversight is clearly important because if there isnt some oversight people dont have a particular motivation to make sure that the program is successful
4252050 we dont tell the contractor that they need to go out and buy two gallons of windex we leave that up to the contractor

4252052 you would audit enough so people knew you could walk in at anytime and look to see what theyre using
4252053 there are other ways to capture the proof of the success of the program without talking about the types of products and specific dollar amounts

4252090 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4252091 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4252092 after the state by state roll is tallied mrs clinton is expected to turn over her cache of delegates to senator barack obama
4252093 so how will mrs clinton who is a superdelegate herself vote associates say she will throw her lot behind mr obama and ask her supporters to follow suit
4252094 there are many many fine choices senator obama can make for vp
4252095 my first choice would be senator hillary rodham clinton obviously but i have no reason to believe that will happen and i have no idea who the final choice will be
4252096 senator obamas campaign encouraged senator clintons name to be placed in nomination as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
4252097 senator obama and senator clinton are looking forward to a convention unified behind barack obama as the partys nominee and to victory this fall for america
4252098 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4252099 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4252100 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4252101 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4252102 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
4252103 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
4252104 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

4252106 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
4252107 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
4252108 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
4252109 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
4252110 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
4252111 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
4252112 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
4252113 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
4252114 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
4252115 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
4252116 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
4252117 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
4252118 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
4252119 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
4252120 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

4252131 unsere absicht ist es dieses gebiet als biotopschutzgebiet langfristig zu sichern
4252132 wichtig ist aber dass das gesamte areal in nat rlichem zustand erhalten bleibt erst so kann der artenschutz effektiv und nachhaltig betrieben werden
4252133 dieses gew chshaus in graz ist vor allem auch deshalb von h chster kulturhistorischer bedeutung weil es das letzte dieser art in europa ist
4252134 man kann jetzt wirklich nur noch von einem notstand sprechen wir fordern alle ma geblichen stellen auf alles m gliche zur rettung dieses baujuwels zu unternehmen

4252145 that means you will also have less drug reaching the normal tissue
4252146 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4252147 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4252148 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4252149 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy

4252157 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
4252158 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
4252159 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century

4252184 i stand firmly with the members of the senate republican caucus who today announced that they will not support mark olson for the open senate seat of betsy wergin
4252185 the senate republican caucus has made the appropriate decision in rejecting the candidacy of mark olson i understand there are other candidates who may remain eligible to run in the september primary and i would hope that they continue their efforts to become our partys standard bearer
4252186 in the unfortunate event that mr olson succeeds in the september primary i would ask that our party refuse to offer any type of assistance to his campaign while the loss of a state senate seat is unfortunate i join senators senjem fischbach gimse hann koch and michel in the strong belief that we must maintain and uphold our beliefs that violence of any kind whether it is in word or in deed should not be rewarded with our partys support or the support of voters in senate district 16

4252236 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

4252245 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

4252265 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

4252316 mensen hechten er toch veel waarde aan om in de buitenlucht te verblijven dus goed weer mag eigenlijk niet ontbreken zegt frank klootwijk n van de drijvende krachten achter de feestweek in s gravenzande
4252317 s gravenzande moet het vooral van die dingen hebben zegt klootwijk
4252318 in vergelijking met andere dorpsfeesten zijn er bij ons minder activiteiten voor specifiek kinderen of senioren de braderie en kermis zijn heel belangrijk en in de avonduren speelt het feest zich af rond de barretjes
4252319 we proberen altijd alle leeftijdsgroepen bij de feestweek te betrekken zodat iedereen het ook naar zn zin heeft zegt cor alleblas van het maasdijkse spektakel
4252320 wij zeggen altijd dat er voor iedereen van 8 tot 80 jaar iets te doen is zo is er bijvoorbeeld een koor en klaverjassen voor 55 plussers en een clown voor de jongste kinderen voor de jongeren van rond de twintig is er op vrijdagmiddag stampmuziek en treedt er ook een band op

4252350 creo que es dif cil dirigir a colo colo y estas cosas pueden suceder pero yo conozco la interna del plantel para decir si est bien o est pero son los costos de dirigir a un equipo grande
4252351 hablar de mi pasada no tiene sentido yo soy ex entrenador de colo colo e incluso no s si se fue o lo echaron pero colo colo es un equipo dif cil de manejar
4252352 los proyectos en los equipos grandes son dif ciles de mantener porque se piden resultados de inmediato pero hay muchos factores que se deben trabajar y no s lo ser campe n

4252356 do i talk about the times i paint my face and loudly cheer at the basketball games or the times my professor walks me through a difficult problem step by step on huskyct the night before a difficult exam what i usually mention is the universitys profound effort to help and provide for the students they listen to the needs and wishes of the students such as offering 300 clubs and organizations to help a student be involved in almost anything that interests him her or providing residential learning communities first year experience classes and student mentors tutors to help students adjust to college life after high school to answer the question i simply say i love it
4252357 because were a good value and because were getting even better exciting things are happening on our campuses and were going places uconn is regarded as the best public university in new england and among the top 25 public universities in the nation and the proof is in our graduates 94 are either employed or have gone on to graduate or professional school
4252358 the reason that i like going to the university of dallas is that there is a really extensive core curriculum for all the students so we get a strong basis for education and it really unifies us all as well its a good education in general
4252359 t he distinctive curriculum offered at the university the foundation of the undergraduate curriculum is a set of about 20 core courses that are taken by all students the curriculum engages students with the great ideas and works of the western world an integral part of the core curriculum is a semester studying at our campus in rome italy students read and write about the most important issues of life excellent teachers inspire students to think critically write well and speak authoritatively
4252360 to me the best reason would probably be the value of the university education also were in a downtown setting completely surrounded by all parts of denver so we have a lot of internships the main reason i came was for affordability the programs and the location
4252361 i would say smaller class sizes good individual attention from a committed passionate faculty the campus is an urban campus so the students are very much in touch with the denver community around them since were right in denver

4252472 each time you type one of these your brain is doing something amazing
4252473 your brain is performing a task that despite 50 years of research in computer science we cannot yet get computers to do
4252474 approximately 200 million of these are typed every day by people around the world each time you type one of these essentially you waste about 10 seconds of your time
4252475 if you multiply that by 200 million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting around 500 000 hours every day typing these annoying squiggly characters
4252476 especially for older documents things that were written before 1900 where the ink has faded and the pages have yellowed out the computer makes a lot of mistakes
4252477 and the number of words that weve been able to digitize like this is insanely large its like over a billion its like 1 3 billion by now
4252478 next year if all goes well we can do as many as 70 years which would be almost the entire rest of the archive that is not digitized
4252479 its just pretty cool when youre signing up for a web site and you see the recaptcha sign you sort of know gee im helping digitize part of the
4252480 like for example some sort of ink blot on the page

4252488 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4252489 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4252490 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4252491 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4252496 people today are afraid to be alone this fear is a dominant mark of our society many now ceaselessly sit in the cinema or read novels about other peoples lives or watch dramas why simply to avoid having to face their own existence no one seems to want and no one can find a place of quiet because when you are quiet you have to face reality but many in the present generation dare not do this because on their own basis reality leads them to meaninglessness so they fill their lives with entertainment even if it is only noise the christian is supposed to be very opposite there is a place for proper entertainment but we are not to be caught up in ceaseless motion which prevents us from ever being quiet rather we are to put everything second so we can be alive to the voice of god and allow it to speak to us and confront us

4252696 but as a christian leader i am deeply sad that public morality is the second victim of this legal judgement
4252697 max mosley claimed that what consenting adults do with each other behind closed doors however depraved brutal and repugnant is both private and harmless i think that is deplorable and i believe most people would ridicule his claim
4252698 so mosley the 68 year old multi millionaire son of the former wartime fascist leader sir oswald mosley walked out of court with more money than corporal jamie cooper who came back from the battle grounds of iraq with horrendous injuries and was awarded only 57 000 compensation for sacrificing his life and it took him and his family 18 months to get it doesnt seem fair does it
4252699 where i come from and im not just talking location here but mindset people who indulge in that kind of deviancy would be written off as sick in the head depraved morally bankrupt and where i come from people who think that kind of sex is normal would be offered psychological counselling on the grounds theyre on the rocky road to hell
4252700 imagine mosleys children alexander 38 and patrick 36 looking back on their childhood and thinking about all those times daddy played with them cuddled them dandled them on his knee knowing that at some point after hed left them hed go and visit some s amp m den to be flogged by tarts

4252702 prostitution is and will always be one of the saddest and most desperate of professions because it exploits desperate hopeless women
4252703 what mosley gets up to behind closed doors isnt like some naughty little scene from carry on spanking its black dark deviant sex which is gangrenous to the soul and corrupts all who indulge in it
4252704 its that a man has walked from court without a legal stain on his character thanks to a judge who believes privacy to be more important than morality thats british justice 2008

4252726 detailed and informative website providing advice on how to switch
4252727 the important thing is not the official cash rate but what the level of interest borrowers are paying
4252728 our view is that their implementation of the account switching package is really not good enough
4252729 industry has followed the path of least resistance to get in place a package that meets the treasurers requirements with the least amount of effort possible
4252730 come november there is going to be this package in place and it does mean multiple physical trips to the banks and no guarantee that all your direct debits will be switched you the customer still bear all of the risk
4252731 if the government doesnt follow through on that report and actually do something that account switching package has no teeth
4252732 choice warmly welcomed our package in february and have been participating in constructive discussions since then so their comments are somewhat surprising
4252733 we would expect choice to look favourably on any attempts by the government to help families make the banking system work for them not against them which is what our initiatives will do

4252759 were extremely disappointed this report appears to condone the use of deadly force in a situation where the soldiers could not be and admit they were not certain of what they were looking at we believe that there were grounds for them to realize that they were looking at a journalist this puts us in the position where journalists cannot raise a camera in the presence of israeli soldiers without the risk of being fired on and we find that unacceptable and were going to be discussing with the israeli officials how we can improve the safety of our journalists in the future
4252760 we are not sure of a motive right now for the shooting or what caused it or if he was looking for any particular person thats something detectives will be determining we have approximately fifteen to twenty witnesses that we are interviewing but right now thats about all we are willing to release at this point until such time as we find out the condition of the suspect as well as a possible motive
4252761 my call of course is for the territorial integrity of georgia to be respected and for the ceasefire agreement to be honoured

4252773 when did you become boring and do you not know what fun is
4252774 you need 3 a levels in maths biology amp chemistry
4252775 im very proud to stand here tonight to say i have the support of his family
4252776 my focus is on the type of comprehensive care our community has
4252777 ive had the opportunity to work side by side with congressman mcnulty
4252778 a vote for me in september and again in november will ensure a vote for real change
4252779 with 47 million americans uninsured and 25 million underinsured it is imperative that our next congress pass the neccessary legislation to ensure that all americans hav access to affordable healthcare
4252780 if we want to change washington we need to start by changing the type of people we send there
4252781 medicare was a single payer health insurance plan for the elderly the concept is to extend that to the entire population
4252782 we have democratic candidates here who are all going to say they support single payer health insurance
4252783 the question is who is going to be the most likely person to advocate for this in washington
4252784 what we need to do is send someone to washington who is not controlled or influenced by lobbyists who are going to oppose single payer health insurance
4252785 i have absolutely no ties to those lobbyists i dont work for a lobbying firm like tracey brooks nor have i taken thousands of dollars from health insurance companies like paul tonko
4252786 its not just a matter of saying it its a matter of working really hard to achieve it
4252787 phil i always hate to dissapoint you but im not going to support single payer health insurance
4252788 all democrats are virtually the same on this campaign except me
4252789 im on medicare right now and im not particularly happy with it
4252790 the government is so dysfunctional it cant make anything better
4252791 all about homeland security because if were not safe none of these other issues that were talking about are going to matter
4252792 and i dont want to see abortion in there either i dont think we should be funding death of infants and the unborn in our health care system its a contradiction
4252793 it takes community dialogue and investment from all of us
4252794 i will continue to promote my reputation as an agent of change
4252795 that track record proves the ability to get things done
4252796 they are asked to compete in a global market place their competitiveness is dulled by the inordinate amount of health care that they try to provide in order to recruit better opportunities
4252797 theres a lot to be said i think for stewardship in a larger pool
4252798 the question to be asked is how did we get here why is it that americans pay two and a half times more than any other industrialized nation and recieve less
4252799 bring the power back to the people the fact is that you know who can make the best decision for your family is yourself and that is you
4252800 forty cents on the dollar trying to figure out ways to deny people coverage
4252801 three cents on the dollar on administration because its simply a system of making payments
4252802 we have the finest health care system in the world
4252803 there has to be a better outcome in my opinion i believe the will is there but we have to determine the means by which were going to be much more successful
4252804 paper shuffling and administrative costs that is not what people want to see out of the product
4252805 to drive down costs stretch our dollars provide better service and be more responsive and responsible to the consuming public
4252806 that is not right in a free market capitalists system that have made this country great were moving away from our basic principles of this country
4252807 if we cut that forty percent we would be covering the 47 million americans who dont have health insurance
4252808 we can also help people be more compliant with thier heath care
4252809 im pro choice when it comes to health care were going to have to keep private insurance with us for some time youre not going to be able to make an immediate transition by passing a magical bill thats going to disrupt everyones lives
4252810 im running for this congressional seat but i dont trust the government
4252811 there is a serious concern about how well thats being done
4252812 looking at a different scenario that would contatin those costs guarantee the coverage require the pooling of resource and i think theres a benefit than can befall the american public by so doing
4252813 wouldnt it be great to see a little gecko on an ad that says i just saved 3 000 on my health insurance
4252814 i think the role of private health insurance is somewhat limited at this point
4252815 at this point in time i believe that the insurance companies have definitely reached their limit in how than can be effective and helpful so we need to be reforming our health care system and providing comprehensive health care coverage for every american
4252816 under the single payer system the role of private insurance companies would be largely eliminated and confined to providing any supplemental coverage that would not be available in the single payer plan
4252817 the way hmos make money is by not covering legitimate claims
4252818 physicians are forced to hire all kinds of people to fill out all the insurance forms to keep track of what the insurers are required and thats very wasteful and costly to the system physicians want to practice medicine not health insurance
4252819 there is a drastic sense of woe id almost say its an embarassment that every year half a million americans file for bankruptcy based on medical expenses i think is grossly difficult to admit that in this nation of plenty of tremendous resources has that curse
4252820 absolutely not we live in america we have freedom we have liberties
4252821 if congress was a corporation theyd be arrested for fraud can we truly trust the government
4252822 these arent my numbers theyre from the government accounting office
4252823 if we have one american who is uninsured we have a health care crisis
4252824 comprehensive health care coverage for every single person in the united states
4252825 there are a number of places we can work together to bring the cost of health care down
4252826 one person visiting our emergency rooms without health care coverage continues to keep in jeopardy our health care providers
4252827 if someone doesnt have health insurance coverage and they go to the emergency room who pays everyone in this room
4252828 they have spent a lifetime to save that is wrong
4252829 that can mean economic devastation to that family for a very long time if not forever so we absolutley need a system a system such as single payer that provides universal coverage
4252830 i actually did you the answer in my other answer
4252831 wheres the american flag in this is this a mosque
4252832 next their gonna tell me i cant drink my gallon of porter and my bottle of tullamore dew every week
4252833 what are the allegiances of those that represent you come from do the represent you
4252834 we have taken any um i have the largest number of individual donors in the campaign were very proud to have over 1 500 supporters supporting my campaign weve done an oustanding job raising money and were very excited about the momentum thats brought to us many of you enjoyed the wonderful television commercials
4252835 so were very excited to have the largest number of individuals that we have the largest percentage of those individuals and that money coming from inside this district and im very proud of the campaign im running
4252836 the answer is none i also have total support for public finance of elections
4252837 those lobbyists are working for interests in the health insurance industry
4252838 you gotta look and see where did they take their contributions from whether theyre running for county legislature as i did or state assembly as tracey brooks and paul tonko did and see if in those campaigns they took contributions from health care
4252839 so the answer in my campaign is aboslutley none in any time in any way
4252840 i dont believe in it if you want campaign reform here i am
4252841 if you dont money youre not considered a serious candidate
4252842 all the media have to do is give all of us equal space tell people about our websites all people have to do is read it people that dont have computers they can make a nice chart and summarize all the candidates thats camaign reform
4252843 after 24 years of service in the legislature i can tell you that there were some donations in that capacity however in the vast majority of the funds ive raise primarily they were raised by five ten twenty five fifty dollar contributions people that you represent totally believed in the work you were doing and the manner of the professionalism in your job
4252844 and until the system is changed and your trying to do the good work its unfortunate but your trapped in that situation but look at the record i think you can see it balances there might have been dollars contributed but more importantly look at the record
4252845 today im proud to say because of that tenacity and that vision and support of a great coaltiion people who are mentally ill or who struggle with mental health disorders have the hope of mental health parity insurance coverage so look at the record
4252846 i hear the urgency in your voice i share it
4252847 i dont think taiwan is so great i wouldnt want to live there
4252848 the second thing is that we have this irrational view that private enterprise can solve all problems
4252849 i think america hasnt alwas had respet to other nation that shows up in our foreign policy as well i think we need to learn sometimes from other countries
4252850 i think its a right in this country to have access and to affordable quality health care
4252851 were playing games where in the constitution does it say its ok to abort the unborn
4252852 it has been used to support a whole host of beneficial government programs and regulations that im sure everyone in this room would support
4252853 the primary issue that im concerned about is that the most efficient way to provide health coverage for every single american is a single payer system
4252854 i can assure it would be far less far far less than what our business currently pays to provide health insurance to its employees
4252855 walmart is gonna be hurt because theyre going to be forced to pay for their employees
4252856 it all comes into an economic model that has proved itself to bring cost savings
4252857 the adminstrative costs of health care right now would more efficiently and effectively utilized
4252858 what is wrong with us this is not rocket science please everyone just think about
4252859 what happens in a single payer plan since all that care would be covered under that plan you wouldnt have to have attorneys litigating to determine how much to pay to the health care plan
4252860 is to make sure that the coverage were providing under the single payer care is as good at least as that health care coverage provided to our members of congress
4252861 who arent going to change their party affiliation next week
4252862 we also need to make sure that we are working with people who dont agree with us right now and i have been able to bring people together in the totality of my career who dont agree and come together and find a resolution
4252863 my country promised me i would always have healthcare bull
4252864 all of dan oconnel and cornings people were republicans before they were democrats republicans are people too
4252865 those that are in power and those are arent in power and they call themselves different things in different times in different places
4252866 i think the proof is in the pudding weve had a successful medicare system for a long time
4252867 we need to move forward with a system that streamlines their payment
4252868 we are committed to ensuring comprehensive health care coverage for every single american
4252869 and i think that the effort to come up with that better is before us we can adjust it as we go but lets go forward the 676
4252870 in the past three years weve seen growth we never expected from the millstone service line
4252871 weve upgraded the system with new pumps and air actuators and timers and actually went out and bought a pump truck to haul sewage from the millstone lift station that exceeds gasds contract with laurie
4252872 yesterday sunday aug 10 we pumped 9 000 gallons with the truck plus the six thousand gallons we sent to you
4252873 on the fourth of july weekend we pumped 15 000 gallons in one day
4252874 we would like to reduce the time were spending running our pump truck up and down o road
4252875 has there ever been an overflow as a result of their pumping
4252876 not that im aware of it may be that we can tolerate 12 000 gallons per day
4252877 we visited this subject a year or so ago so its not like we would have to start from scratch
4252878 im concerned about selling off what belongs to the city

4252890 franks extensive experience in the entertainment and media industries combined with johns deep management experience in telecommunications will provide valuable perspectives to our already diverse board
4252891 aside from protecting my hair from the heat it is very effective when straightening my hair
4252892 this product somewhat helps wavy hair stay straight but doesnt leave it soft or shiny on the contrary it leaves a stiff residue like that of firm hold hairspray sprayed on wet hair its undetectable but youll feel like youre blow drying with no product an unpleasant experience that causes breakage
4252893 this light lotion is a safe option for o d ers who just cant stop at a nickel sized dollop of straightening cream like me worked through wet curls before a blow dry it renders hair slippery and round brushable without an oily silicone effect my blow out remained nicely un wavy all day
4252894 it kept my hair from becoming wavy at the end of the day but is still no match for humidity
4252895 it makes my hair nice shiny and frizz free after blow drying or straightening does the same job as the expensive products your hairdresser tries to sell you for half the price
4252896 i still have a few flyways when i use it but frizz is definitely minimized and it also adds shine not a bad price either
4252897 moderation is the key just a little too much makes hair look greasy instead of shiny
4252898 this product consistently works for me on both wet and dry hair to tame frizz and leave my hair shiny its best mixed with a creamy leave in conditioner if applying to wet hair but works great on its own to tame stray frizzes or smooth dry ends when hair is dry
4252899 price is high but when i find a bargain price i stock up
4252900 it really gets the frizz out of my hair when i wear it curly and adds a little shine to it i also love the packaging the pump makes it so easy to use
4252901 you do have to take care to distribute well throughout hair if too much is in one area it appears greasy and feels crunchy
4252902 i live in the muggy south and this product has become an essential for surviving hot and humid days it tames my hair and leaves it silky smooth and smelling fresh
4252903 no frizz at all even when i apply it on wet hair and my hair is super thick it has a very nice sweet smell to it and leaves just a little shine without feeling thick or greasy its like a miracle for my hair
4252904 if you put on too much it makes your hair look somewhat greasy it smells sort of good at first but then your hair will smell kind of gross after awhile i also find that it leaks out of the bottle in small amounts
4252905 i put this on when my hair is damp just before i blow dry the result is unbelievable straight shiny like crazy and very few flyaways the trick is to put it on slightly damp hair
4252906 this bottle is really tiny and goes fast if you really have a lot of hair like me and it gets expensive to use on a regular basis
4252907 it really does protect your hair from damage from curling irons and straighteners it also really brings out the different browns in your hair
4252908 this left my thick coarse colored straightened hair feeling too puffy and greasy even when i used really small amounts
4252909 i use this product every day i had a really bad experience with a perm and instead of curling it started frizzing now my hair is curly as it should be and soft
4252910 i add water to it before distributing through my hair before doing this i found that my hair was very limp happens when i use too much product
4252911 not much is needed i used it on my normally straight hair that has just a touch of a perm left amp it seamed to control it some
4252912 unfortunately after using this pr oduct and blowing my hair dry my hair feels sort of sticky and dry definitely not run your fingers through it soft as id hoped
4252913 my hair is naturally wavy this product did a wonderful job at lightly smoothing my waves i used it with fekkais wave spray that looked soft and shiny
4252914 i seriously cant say anything bad about it except that the price is a bit higher than id like to pay but im willing to do it if it means beating the humidity with gorgeous hair
4252915 this product is okay and a decent approximation of matrixs smoothing cream didnt really do much for my hair but reduce frizz a bit i have very curly hair so i dont need much in the way of curl boosting
4252916 with this product no more frizz even in rainy weather my blow dried straight bangs no longer curl into a comma shape at the hint of humidity it feels great on your hair doesnt weigh it down at all
4252917 just one or two pumps miraculously detangle knots and tame frizz on all hair types collagen temporarily fills holes in the hair shaft making even color treated hair look instantly shinier and healthier
4252918 my natural curls were bouncy well defined and frizz free
4252919 i have wavy unruly hair when i take the time to straighten it i spray a little of this on my brush and run the brush though my hair it keeps the ends of my very long hair from looking dried out and it has a nice but not overwhelming scent
4252920 beware if you spray too much too close to your head its like straight oil
4252921 this product tamed my hair and did not let it get frizzy even after an entire day in the sun it is very useful when hair is untamable

4252931 i stand firmly with the members of the senate republican caucus who today announced that they will not support mark olson for the open senate seat of betsy wergin
4252932 the senate republican caucus has made the appropriate decision in rejecting the candidacy of mark olson i understand there are other candidates who may remain eligible to run in the september primary and i would hope that they continue their efforts to become our partys standard bearer
4252933 in the unfortunate event that mr olson succeeds in the september primary i would ask that our party refuse to offer any type of assistance to his campaign while the loss of a state senate seat is unfortunate i join senators senjem fischbach gimse hann koch and michel in the strong belief that we must maintain and uphold our beliefs that violence of any kind whether it is in word or in deed should not be rewarded with our partys support or the support of voters in senate district 16

4252942 they are telling me at each station how shes done and so far she seems to be quite above average which is good
4252943 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4252944 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4252945 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4252946 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4252947 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4252948 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party

4252978 within the palette of media forms i think games are inherently the most personal of entertainment experiences by linking a players actions motivations and interests into various brands games occupy a unique space where brands can be represented and used in a way that feels like a net positive on the player experience rather than a blatant attempt to sell more soap
4252979 i think there is a place for games in education but right now their most valuable contribution comes in the form of motivation
4252980 kids are good at learning things on their own if they become sufficiently motivated games are a great way to introduce new subjects to kids that they may find dry and boring in a linear format as a toy or a game the subject can come alive in the players imagination
4252981 i really like games that are open ended enough for me to do weird and creative new things and in doing so in my own imagination build a surreal narrative around my experience
4252982 im still very intrigued by what you can accomplish by harnessing the collective imagination of millions of players im also interested in how games can get people to understand the world they live in new ways
4252983 this is such a simple and fun game it probably was an easy game to develop
4252984 there is the game that you want to make and there is the game that you actually make

4252989 this status is typically applied at the request of a family member

4253011 id rather have three excellent pitches versus five good ones so ill be working on my fastball slider and spit finger pitch that i can throw as a changeup
4253012 i slipped that far because i made it clear i was going to college
4253013 they made me a handsome offer but it was a no brainer to go to college at that point im glad i made the decision i did then because i had a great experience at michigan
4253014 but its really worked out well for me because im in a great situation with a club like the indians that really wanted me

4253029 the identification of rheb as a gene involved in the pathogenesis of cancer opens new avenues for the development of anti cancer therapies as rheb is an inherently druggable target indeed we are already testing such drugs alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutics in faithful animal models
4253030 the key clinical implication is that rheb levels in tumor tissue could indicate patients that will benefit from relatively non toxic therapies with targeted drugs like rapamyicn or inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme

4253033 the presence capability would be potentially very powerful for students to be able to be in contact with teachers if the teachers make themselves available on the system
4253034 weve seen a significant level of interest from higher education and learning institutions at least one a week that is interested in some aspect of the technology
4253035 the conferencing aspect is proving attractive in allowing interaction with remote campuses
4253036 the roundtable videoconferencing device also enables institutions to offer classes that potentially would have been taken off the curriculum because there werent enough students in one location to run it
4253037 fans continue to get involved in the games discussing the athletes and events online

4253044 we rushed to the site and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burnt prayer rugs were scattered all the place
4253045 our revenues in the first six months of 2008 were almost the same as our revenues in our entire 2007 fiscal year during the first six months we have achieved significant milestones by successfully completing different types of proof of concept units proving our technical capabilities in providing valuable solutions to our customers needs we believe that these achievements will ultimately lead into millions of dollars of orders
4253046 we face a fascinating challenge in finding solutions for the ground support equipment in u s air force and u s navy inventory that should flourish in the future coupled with our current activities with customers like northrop grumman as well as european aerospace companies designed to generate revenues and cash flow to ensure a healthy diversified company
4253047 i continue to be very pleased with our revenue growth during these non seasonal quarters sales during these quarters come almost entirely from our existing wholesale customers and as such act as a same store sales measurement tool our experience suggests that revenue growth during these non seasonal quarters builds a solid foundation for further dramatic revenue growth when our peak season gets underway
4253048 despite inflationary pressures and building inventory for the upcoming holiday season we continue to achieve solid improvements in our margins all the while maintaining our strict quality standards i am proud of our successes in these areas and anticipate that further improvements in equipment and commercial baking applications will continue to allow us to enjoy our successful marriage of high quality with solid margins
4253049 we kept our general amp administrative costs down while supplying the necessary resources in the form of sales related expenses to continue to increase sales in existing markets and take advantage of additional opportunities in new markets once our peak season gets underway our investment in new sales territories and a beefed up inventory will turn into ever growing revenue which sets the stage for yet another banner holiday season for the tootie pie company
4253050 oi brussels this is a load of shite now get back there and come up with something that makes sense
4253051 4 the dutch and french have their own political systems we have ours only a federalist would argue that we should impose our system of ratification on another state
4253052 that is the kind of legalistic perspective preferred by the yes politicians im looking at it from a moral perspective is it morally correct to force something on 2 nations that have voted no just because their govts ask us to and as for the question of whether it is our business i reply these 2 govts have made it our business by asking us to collude in this attack on democracy
4253053 on the question of the vetoes i would cite 2 reports by the london school of economics professor helen wallace and by the science po university in paris which have shown the eu institutions are already more efficient in decisionmaking under the nice treaty arrangements and as such we dont need to give up more vetoes the latter source found that the speed of eu decisionmaking has increased by 25 since nice so that argument is debunked
4253054 nice hyperbole the constitutional treaty was changed to accommodate the views of the dutch and the french electorates their democratically elected political leadership negotiated those changes and were elected on platforms of the ratification by parliament
4253055 youre probably not aware but you switched tenses about thirty times in that post its a tough concept to grasp but if youre interested this xyz site has some great resources on that
4253056 todays event is a key inflection point that shows the industry the breadth and depth of eas portfolio

4253068 well why didnt you say it was a knacker puppy
4253069 as the states only public academic health center and public university hospital providing connecticuts uninsured citizens with access to our healthcare services is the right thing to do and an essential part of our mission
4253070 unfortunately our participation in the charter oak health plan is almost certain to increase the health centers projected deficit for fy09
4253071 the decision to participate in the charter oak health plan was very stressful for us
4253072 were in the business of health care and as health care providers we see the need to improve access to care
4253073 at the end of the day its a win win for hospitals
4253074 in a day of declining reimbursement rates physicians have to carefully consider the impact of such contracts on their practices financial health as small businesses they can only afford to join health plans that pay them fairly for the services they render
4253075 each physician makes an individual choice whether to join any health plan including but by no means limited to the charter oak health plan
4253076 at this point csms members are left to wonder why funding for health care is not slated to be used for payment for medical care and is instead being funneled to participating health plans
4253077 we know that if reimbursement for services under the charter oak plan approximates the level of reimbursement under the medicaid program our forecasted deficit this year will rise
4253078 i dont need no stinkin benchmark because i only use index funds so my portfolio is the benchmark
4253079 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4253080 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
4253081 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
4253082 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4253083 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration
4253084 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4253085 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4253086 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4253087 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4253088 absolute return portfolio produced an annualized 13 1 percent exceeding the passive benchmark of the
4253089 as sort of a clearing house for proper portfolios benchmarking
4253090 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4253091 that problem is pretty easily solved by calculating a portfolios time weighted return rather than irr or dollar weighted return and comparing the twr to the benchmark return twr removes the impact of cash flows on portfolio performance
4253092 you bring up a major issue with performance measurement cash flows in a portfolio are handled differently than cash flows in an index so there will always be some irr tracking error in between the portfolio and the index in an index it is assumed that the dividend is paid on the ex dividend date and reinvested in the index however in a portfolio the divided does not come in until the dividend payment date and then it might take another day or so to reinvest so by default using irr the portfolio cannot match the irr of the index
4253093 i advised my campaign people we should drop it i didnt think i could make up that many votes so i opted not to do it
4253094 todd called me about 7 30 friday night aug 8 and congratulated me we decided not to make a big deal of it so many days after the election
4253095 were looking at that were just putting our campaign to bed and looking at what the next steps will be
4253096 the rate of inflation for all commodities for the week ended august 2 2008 stands at 12 44 per cent higher than the rate of 12 01 per cent reported last week
4253097 after being nearly stable for four weeks this rise has come as a major disappointment
4253098 taking the law into their own hands and causing destruction to life and public property
4253099 whatever the problem whatever the cause whatever the reason there is no place for violence in our society there is no issue that does not lend itself to dialogue and reconciliation
4253100 calm be always maintained in all parts of the country and wherever differences exist all efforts be directed towards reconciliation
4253101 i am confident that the concept of india that is functioning in unison in a milieu of a vast diversity will continue to define our identity
4253102 we should pause and reflect on how our conduct and our actions are promoting unity we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to the strengthening of the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4253103 india has been the target of terrorist attacks for several decades
4253104 we must stand united against the threats emanating from terrorism terrorists with their disruptive agenda will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace from our region
4253105 often we are vocal about our rights but we tend to focus less on our numerous duties we have duties towards the country society and family of which we can ignore none we must remember that while discharging our duties we have an obligation to act responsibly
4253106 no one should be left behind as the nation progresses it is my wish that growth and prosperity reaches every state every district every city every town every village and every individual of the country we have attained impressive rates of growth but empowerment of all sections of society still remains unaccomplished
4253107 people and organisations who work tirelessly without expectation of rewards unseen and maybe unsung constitute the foundation of a nation and give it inherent strength
4253108 even as more details are awaited prima facie all the concerns of the defence forces appear to have been suitably addressed

4253116 there are some vested interests which want to create a misunderstanding between the people and the force the crpf is a people friendly force and is out there to maintain peace and law and order
4253117 this movement is not about just 800 kanals of land but about resolution of the kashmir issue which is the root cause of all the crises we are protesting against the atrocities committed by the j amp k police and the crpf while people were moving towards muzaffarabad it is their right to cross the loc
4253118 people here were not armed with trishuls swords or petrol bombs as in jammu and police exercised maximum restraint there but 40 people were martyred here in just three days

4253124 the united states is now accepting musharrafs removal as a fait accompli
4253125 they just want that he should not be humiliated we dont want his humiliation either
4253126 they are saying if you do it according to the book its none of our business they have pushed against mr musharraf
4253127 with one voice they said this is the time you have to be with the democratic forces
4253128 but no one is actually in the mood to see what it is going to be like to be in the post musharraf era
4253129 we very very strongly feel it has to be a man of national consensus a man of stature a man everyone looks up to as a head of state
4253130 this software also will help address the mobile industrys fragmentation issue by enabling developers to create a single interface that will work anywhere java is found
4253131 its real strength is in providing a rich framework that developers can easily build upon optimize collaborate around and then deploy on billions of devices
4253132 in this way lwuit is becoming a unifying ui layer that allows developers to focus on creating compelling user interfaces and ultimately delivering new and engaging applications across a wide range of platforms
4253133 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4253135 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4253136 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4253137 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4253138 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4253139 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4253181 hes really pleased he thought it was good news i think hes hopeful
4253182 its another chance for us to argue why the u s officials should be held liable for sending maher to syria to be tortured and i think its a great sign that the court decided to rehear the case on their own
4253183 we had one judge who strongly disagreed with that opinion and thought that the officials should be held accountable for what they did to maher or at the very least that the case should proceed past this point
4253184 it seems perfectly reasonable to me for a country to reserve the right to decide who enters
4253185 its like you have a right to decide who enters your house

4253192 our study adds strong evidence that cutting down helps reduce stroke risk but quitting is unquestionably the best option
4253193 our study supports the need to target smoking as a preventable and modifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease in young women
4253194 the fact that we saw this abnormal difference in gene expression in at least 10 of the colon cancer patients and in very few people without colon cancer strongly suggests that it plays an important role in this disease

4253196 while gaining too much weight can present health risks its even more dangerous to have the abdominal type of obesity people should measure their waistline from time to time and avoid the accumulation of abdominal fat
4253197 physicians should measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of whr or waist circumference should be used doctors should also consider the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease

4253199 ear infections are relevant to taste because one of the most important taste nerves goes through the middle ear on the way to the brain

4253202 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4253203 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4253204 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4253205 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4253206 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4253207 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4253208 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4253209 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4253210 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4253211 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4253212 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4253213 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4253214 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4253215 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4253216 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4253217 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4253218 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4253219 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4253220 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4253221 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4253222 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4253223 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4253224 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4253225 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4253226 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4253227 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4253228 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4253239 one of the more celebrated cases in new hampshire jurisprudence is that of hale versus everett
4253240 as late as 1868 the state supreme court decided that a unitarian minister would not be allowed to use the town meeting house because of his heterodoxy and in spite of being called and settled by a majority of the community
4253241 i know we are here unitarians and non unitarians and i rejoice to stand with christians with catholic and protestant christians alike for justice and purity and i will always do so these things are more important than our little differences of theological opinion

4253256 thinking beyond the contemporary mantra of democracy elections and decentralization
4253257 a tension at the international level between promoting poverty reduction and promoting competitive multi party democracy
4253258 in many cases democracies produce governments which are very effective in reducing poverty witness recent experience in brazil for example
4253259 there are less democratic regimes which have been and are very effective in reducing poverty and the international community needs to recognise that part of this effectiveness may be due to the nature of the regime where a strong connection between regime and citizens has been forged through a popular movement which generates a social compact between elite and the poor as part of a national development project
4253260 china and vietnam would also be examples and there are others during the last 60 years the implication for the international community would be to exercise caution in attaching political conditionalities to aid or other international negotiations of course this does not mean that in extreme cases eg zimbabwe the international community should not take a strong political position
4253261 we need to talk about this especially after traumatic events autocracies may do nation building more effectively than elected governments there is more to politics than ballot counting

4253281 essentially there is a gang of ten senators five republicans led by lindsey graham john thune saxby chambliss bob corker and johnny isaakson they joined five democrats to craft an energy bill in the senate that is exactly what barack obama wants it is an utter disaster
4253282 its a democrat giveaway the regulatory hurdles are huge they have expanded they are higher peta has a role the aclu has a role the bill bars drilling within 50 miles of the united states coastline that puts off limits some of the most productive areas even if the states allow it including in anwr well you can only drill in four states anyway under this bill but no you cant drill any closer to 50 miles of the coastline this deal would allow drilling if if and when the epa and peta and states and cities and counties and the aclu clear the way

4253287 debate and town hall questions typically deal with hot political topics like the war the border the price of oil and reaction to campaign statements while important these tend to be short term issues on which the candidates have repeatedly stated their positions the saddleback civil forum will focus on the core convictions of each candidate that would shape how each one would lead and their views on americas role direction and culture
4253288 i am praying for a second reformation of the church that will focus more on deeds than words the first reformation was about beliefs this one needs to be about behavior weve had a reformation what we need now is a transformation

4253290 the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state

4253304 i swam in a meet at the end of the year
4253305 i ended up getting a third place trophy and i said to my mom i want a bigger trophy well honey these kids swim year round and they practice all the time that was it
4253306 because we were swimming since he was able to walk he was at meets all the time he kind of grew into it
4253307 they did a lot of watching after michael too certainly as far as swimming goes michael didnt know anything other than being intensely focused on swimming if his sisters were lackadaisical maybe he wouldnt be doing what hes doing but he never knew any other way to do it
4253308 she could train like no other girl ive ever seen
4253309 its just hard when you see these other people making it people you were swimming against and i had no control i couldnt control my back
4253310 but as i got older matured more i looked back on my career and realized i did a lot more than so many others i should be proud
4253311 i always wonder what a fourth child wouldve been like
4253312 because when i was younger i was gung ho about practice swimming was my life and i was a decent college swimmer then theres whitney who was a little more hesitant to start swimming and then she was really great
4253313 michael was different no way didnt want to put his face in the water i hate practice keep me away and now hes the best ever

4253385 how many rpi students does it take to take down chuck norris
4253386 jeans cannot be removed easily and certainly it is impossible to pull them off if the victim is fighting against her attacker with all her force
4253387 because the victim wore very very tight jeans she had to help him remove them and by removing the jeans it was no longer rape but consensual sex
4253388 it should be noted that it is instinctive especially for a young woman to oppose with all her strength the person who wants to rape her and it is illogical to say that a young woman would passively submit to a rape which is a grave violence for fear of undergoing other hypothetical and no more serious offenses to her physical safety
4253389 this is a small long overdue step forward on a very long road were confident the meeting was meaningful for the participants and were grateful that these victims have had the courage to come forward and speak up but fundamentally it wont change things kids need action catholics deserve action action produces reform and reform real reform is sorely needed in the church hierarchy

4253402 should u s taxpayer money go to places like africa to fund contraception to prevent aids
4253403 well i think its a combination the guy i really respect on this is dr coburn he believes and i was just reading the thing he wrote that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity where that doesnt succeed than he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well but i agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence i look to people like dr coburn im not very wise on it
4253404 i havent thought about it before i give you an answer let me think about let me think about it a little bit because i never got a question about it before i dont know if i would use taxpayers money for it
4253405 what about grants for sex education in the united states should they include instructions about using contraceptives or should it be bushs policy which is just abstinence

4253408 are we on the straight talk express im not informed enough on it let me find out you know im sure ive taken a position on it on the past i have to find out what my position was brian would you find out what my position is on contraception im sure im opposed to government spending on it im sure i support the presidents policies on it

4253882 this analysis assumes that enactment of the legislation in 2008 would result in first production from the anwr area in 10 years i e 2018
4253883 124 spills with a total volume of roughly 17 700 barrels of total petroleum products
4253884 when katrina a cat 5 hurricane hit the gulf coast not one drop of oil was spilled off of those rigs out in the gulf of mexico
4253885 w e didnt have one drop of oil spilt when we had the biggest hurricane in you know recent history hurricane katrina
4253886 earlier this week on this program though you defended offshore drilling and said quote we withstood hurricanes rita and katrina and did not spill a drop in fact the u s mineral management service said that katrina and rita caused 124 offshore spills for a total of more than 743 000 gallons of oil and refined products spilled so nancy do you want to take back what you said
4253887 right well i actually do i was misinformed and my embarrassment aside the point is still that we had a remarkable performance
4253888 joint study by nasa and the smithsonian institution examining several decades worth of data found that more oil seeps into the ocean naturally than from accidents involving tankers and offshore drilling natural seepage from underwater oil deposits leaks an average of 62 million gallons a year offshore drilling on the other hand accounted for only 15 million gallons the smallest source of oil leaking into the oceans
4253889 almost 40 years later after the santa barbara spill the national academy of sciences says mother nature spills more oil into the environment than exxon shell b p and chevron combined 63 percent of all oil in u s coastal waters comes from natural seepage from cracks in the earth 32 percent from consumers in their boats and runoff from cities 4 percent from oil tankers and just 1 percent from offshore platforms
4253890 comparison of the impacts of seeps and spills based solely on volume would be misleading the evidence is clear that far from being invisible against a background of seeps major spills can have far greater and qualitatively different impacts on the environment than do seeps
4253891 natural seeps and spills differ in that seep rates do not on average exceed the marine environments capacity to digest the oil whereas spills may exceed its capacity major spills overwhelm natures mechanisms for processing the oil in the short term the consequences include severe oiling of shorelines and mortality to organisms that are ill prepared to live in an oil soaked environment
4253892 it is our understanding that although cuba has leased out exploration blocks 60 miles off the coast of southern florida which is closer than american firms are allowed to operate in that area no chinese firm is drilling there
4253893 jorge pinon a senior energy fellow at the university of miami specializing in latin america said cuba has awarded offshore oil leases or concessionary blocs in its offshore waters to six oil companies none of them chinese and soon may announce an agreement with brazils state oil company petrobras
4253894 but no one is currently drilling in any of those concessions
4253895 w eve got china you know joining with cuba theyre drilling 60 miles off our shores of florida
4253896 suggested if we all inflated our tires that we would solve the problem
4253897 d o you really think that inflating your tires is a rational energy strategy
4253898 there are things you can do individually to save energy
4253899 work ing with the auto industry in developing some of these new technologies and plug in hybrids
4253900 put ting people back to work building windmills and setting up wind turbines
4253901 will be invested in a number of measures to reduce the burden of rising prices on families
4253902 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0 4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires
4253903 each barrel of oil yields about 26 gallons of gas criticized for record profits companies like chevron say every dollar coming out is going right back in to the quest for more
4253904 the oil companies insist theyre trying to find new oil that might help bring down gas prices but the money they spend on exploration is nothing compared with what they spend on stock buybacks and dividends
4253905 the five biggest international oil companies plowed about 55 percent of the cash they made from their businesses into stock buybacks and dividends last year according to rice universitys james a baker iii institute for public policy
4253906 i n the first quarter of this year exxon conocophillips and chevron were all among the top 10 companies for share buybacks in the s amp p 500
4253907 s tock buybacks are common throughout corporate america not just for big oil they shrink the amount of stock on the open market essentially increasing its value and giving individual shareholders a bigger stake in the company
4253908 a brilliant proposal that finally gives the public something back the certain removal of four offshore oil platforms the decommissioning of a notorious industrial plant and the reversion of rural land subjugated into oil development back into the public trust as parkland
4253909 only 001 percent of the oil produced has been spilled
4253910 every year oily road runoff from a city of 5 million could contain as much oil as one large tanker spill
4253911 it wasnt your fathers fault that he left you know i divorced him when the two of us got married your grandparents werent happy with the idea but they said okay they probably couldnt have stopped us anyway and they eventually came around to the idea that it was the right thing to do then baracks father your grandfather hussein wrote gramps this long nasty letter saying that he didnt approve of the marriage he didnt want the obama blood sullied by a white woman he said well you can imagine how gramps reacted to that and then there was a problem with your fathers first wife he had told me they were separated but it was a village wedding so there was no legal document that could show a divorce
4253912 my mother and lolo would remain cordial through the birth of my sister maya
4253913 the newspaper quoted zulfan adi who described himself as one of obamas closest childhood friends
4253914 but barry was a muslim i remember him wearing a sarong
4253915 i nterviews with dozens of former classmates teachers neighbors and friends show that obama was not a regular practicing muslim when he was in indonesia
4253916 he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug use extended into his law school days or beyond
4253917 barack obama admitted using drugs in his autobiography but never revealed if or when he stopped
4253918 was working as a community organizer out of the harlem campus of the city college of new york
4253919 after leaving harvard graham felsen published an article in an avowedly socialist magazine
4253920 writing in socialist viewpoint in the may june 2006 issue graham felsen discussed a trip to paris in which he participated in leftist street riots that involved a controversial employment law designed to facilitate the ability of french companies to fire workers under twenty six years old
4253921 found the house for obama salon com reported that donna schwan of metro pro realty the real estate agent who listed the property recalled the deal starting when rezko expressed interest in the listing
4253922 asked who approached her about the house schwan told salon i honestly dont remember
4253923 i saw this house i really like it its more than we originally budgeted for id like you to take a look at it
4253924 in his prepared statement obama told the sun times that michelle fell in love with the house
4253925 the boston globe also reported real estate agent schwans recollection that the obamas may not have made the highest bid but that the willingness of the obamas and rita rezko to close in june was decisive
4253926 the couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller
4253927 the transcript of the question and answer session clearly shows the tribune staff had a hard time believing obama yet obama persisted denying he coordinated the purchase with rezko page 168
4253928 offered a lengthy and to us plausible explanation for the presence of now indicted businessman tony rezko in his personal and political lives
4253929 newsmaxs ronald kessler reported that obama had been in trinity united church of christ on july 22 2007 when kessler was present
4253930 blamed the white arrogance of americas caucasian majority for the worlds suffering especially the oppression of blacks
4253931 on july 22nd 2007 he davis sat next to barack obama as barack obama heard some of these same statements from that very preacher wright and was nodding along
4253932 we worked with him specifically on his strategy the republicans were in control of the illinois senate at the time they loved to hold votes on partial birth and born alive they put these bills out all the time because they wanted to pigeonhole democrats
4253933 he came to me and said my members are being attacked
4253934 a present vote was hard to pigeonhole which is exactly what obama wanted
4253935 was give cover to moderate democrats who wanted to vote with us but were afraid to do so
4253936 a present vote would protect them your senator voted present most of the electorate is not going to know what that means
4253937 pointed to the result of most democratic plans to increase corporate taxes the government ends up collecting less capital gains tax revenue not more
4253938 expand to meet military needs on the ground a major stress on our troops comes from insufficient ground forces barack obama supports plans to increase the size of the army by 65 000 troops and the marines by 27 000 troops increasing our end strength will help units retrain and re equip properly between deployments and decrease the strain on military families
4253939 but i did not hear exactly what they were shouting i was completely in the excitement of myself
4253940 it is more exciting to get to the semi finals of the olympics the olympics is a four years once in a lifetime opportunity and its particularly special to have it in china
4253941 my family my husband and my friends were seeing me and backing me it gave me lots of motivation
4253942 you can see whether i am fully fit now through how i played the match tonight
4253943 it is just a rare chance to have the olympics on home soil and i want to see how far i can reach
4253944 were going to be careful with him its certainly possible he wont pitch again this season but what he has shouldnt preclude that
4253945 eeeeeh quando uno nn ha un cazzo da fare v v
4253946 we dont have terrorist attacks here we dont have suicide bombers and i think thats what people think of when they think about terrorism
4253947 there is clearly enough activity for us to be very busy in addressing potential threats
4253948 i think there is some possibility of large scale protests people who may have it in their mind to disrupt this convention
4253949 cyanide is a fast acting chemical used in manufacturing metallurgy and pest extermination that when inhaled or ingested prevents the body from processing oxygen it can also be mixed with certain acids to produce extremely lethal cyanide gas according to the department of justice
4253950 investigators have not said why dirie had cyanide or whether he worked in a job that would have involved using it they also have not said how long dirie had been in denver or whether anyone had accompanied him
4253951 points out a blog post from july with a comment by a somali with the same name as the man found dead in denver with a large amount of possible cyanide
4253952 this has all the earmarks of an islamic terrorist planning to release cyanide gas at the democratic national party in denver
4253953 while we may not be privy to the ongoing investigation it seems quite obvious to us that this guy was a terrorist
4253954 overseeing an information war room that will be staffed around the clock with analysts who access a dozen databases while receiving reports of suspicious activity activity that some civil libertarians claim could be nothing more than engaging in anti war protests or photographing federal facilities that could be targeted for terrorist attack
4253955 when you talk about why you would choose to live here the reasons dont seem legitimate when you say them out loud
4253956 it makes perfect sense to play a game or two in toronto to generate greater support
4253957 in the end it helps keep the bills viable economically speaking in western new york
4253958 i think there is a league wide commitment to keep the team viable in buffalo and this is part of the strategy
4253959 it would be a karmic kick in the nuts for this place
4253960 remove a team like the bills from a city like this and it would be a devastating blow to an already struggling town
4253961 the glory days of buffalo when i was a kid back in the 1970s when the steel plants were raging
4253962 theyve made this big deal that the toronto deal is going to save the franchise
4253963 the bills franchise is solid every game is sold out
4253964 ralph and understandably so gets nervous when people start hovering over his stadium to figure out the next step
4253965 its got to be viable finances are important but i think the community has a huge stake in the bills and i plan on being a part of anybody who wants make sure that is a given
4253966 but i dont think its appropriate for us to keep predicting what the next steps are
4253967 this somewhat finalizes how we want to regionalize this franchise and put a stick in the ground above the border
4253968 we would be remiss if we did not try to capture over five million people within our home marketing territory and try to strengthen the franchise right here in western new york
4253969 it boils down to the same old story follow the money
4253970 what kimuchi wants kimuchi gets all because of orgasm yes its all for orgasm gentlemen
4253971 nominations to the watch list are handled and reviewed by non political career intelligence and law enforcement officials who make their determinations solely on the basis of the available information and whether there is a reasonable suspicion to believe the individual is involved in terrorism
4253972 im stuck with everyone else on this list wondering am i someones political enemy or do i live in a country where the government is just utterly and completely incompetent
4253973 right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4253974 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4253975 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
4253976 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4253977 we still dont have a motive and its going to be difficult to determine that
4253978 they introduced themselves and at that time he pulled out a handgun and shot chairman gwatney several times
4253979 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
4253980 michelle and i are heartbroken to hear about the tragic loss of chairman bill gwatney were praying for his family and friends and all who worked with him and loved him
4253981 it makes you wonder what got into somebody to do something so horrible
4253982 the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed and instead deferred maintenance
4253983 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew
4253984 oi tudo bem como vai o dia ah que isso puxa aquela cadeira ali senta e fica mais um pouco vou pedir que te tragam um caf por aqui a mesma correria de sempre sabe mas assim que bom
4253985 conflict that israelis and non israelis would rather not discuss will spiral out of control if we continue to ignore it
4253986 i am so sorry my brother for not doing what was right on the day of your wedding
4253987 we got a container and chased it around the bottom of a crate for a while we used the internet to identify it and were quite shocked when we found out what it was
4253988 incentives including a doubling to 250 000 from 125 000 in the amount of expenses businesses can immediately write off
4253989 second provision will provide a 50 percent bonus depreciation deduction for the cost of leasehold improvements and certain other equipment the provision is effective for improvements placed in service during 2008
4253990 taxpayers are permitted to claim 50 percent of the cost of the acquired eligible property as depreciation in the first year the property is placed in service the remaining 50 percent of the cost is depreciated under the regular rules for example assume that a business acquires property with a cost of 10 000 that would ordinarily be depreciated over a five year period without the bonus depreciation this business would be entitled to a deprectiation decudtion of 2 000 in the first year and 3 200 in the second year the remaining cost of 4 800 would be depreciated in decreasing amounts over the next four taxable years depreciation generally assumes a one half year allowance in the first and last years of the propertys use so that a five year schedule of depreciation is spread over six taxable years if bonus depreciation is allowed the business may first deduct 5 000 as bonus depreciation with another 1 000 20 x 5 000 allowed as regular depreciation thus the total first year depreciation would be 6 000 for the first year and 1 600 in the second year again the remaining cost of 2 400 would be depreciated in decreasing amounts over the next four taxable years
4253991 how perfect im on maternity leave so i can go soon
4253992 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4253993 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4253994 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover
4253995 disney channel is a huge business serving kids all around the world and its especially successful with girls our goal with disney xd is to have that same success ratio with boys
4253996 disney xd will showcase great stories and empowering characters with disneys brand credibility and a cool creative factor that will set it apart from the pack
4253997 we are actually reviewing iphones from a hsbc group perspective and when i say that i mean globally
4253998 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there
4253999 but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different
4254000 the stay is important because it keeps me on the ballot
4254001 even if the maine court acts and grants the stay the likelihood is that we cannot depend on them to maintain the stay until the ballots are printed were protecting ourselves by going to the u s supreme court i expect the request will be oiled by close of business on aug 15
4254002 the market growth has been slowing but inbev stands out as being the weakest of the bunch
4254003 over the next two years the deal will make things very difficult for inbev
4254004 what the heck does sewmyheadon have to do with web design linux open source and wordpress
4254005 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4254006 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4254007 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4254008 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4254009 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4254010 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4254011 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4254055 the prolonged softness in the overall economy particularly in the construction and housing segments caused many commercial truck owners to defer purchase or lease of new vehicles
4254056 high diesel fuel prices have also impacted industry sales while there has been a near collapse in the pickup truck market and continued softness in the overall commercial truck market our company has been better able to withstand the softness because of our expansion into markets not served by the company as recently as 2004

4254059 we are out here trying to win games these guys are trying to win wars
4254060 they risk their lives every single day it is not a comparison we run and get tired these guys get up at 5 in the morning run and get trained they are on call not knowing where they could go over seas there is no comparison
4254061 seeing them picks us up and makes us work harder because we know what they do every day in their training it pushes us to train harder
4254062 its nice coming out here and watching them practice it is great
4254063 its good training you always have to give 100 percent and you have to be able to count on the people around you that is the same with us you have to be able to count on the people you are with as people and soldiers

4254108 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4254109 in no way is the presidents plan for in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4254110 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4254111 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles

4254158 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa

4254230 an important time of progression for hardcore music were the 1990s when several bands created new sounds and hardcore music changed fast and finally split up once again in diverse scenes from tough guy metal bullshit to a innovative political scene all around the world which transformed the music into new spheres and kept the original punk spirit alive one of the epicentre of this movement was san diego with the swing kids as one of their important bands but not only outstanding for san diego swing kids created a whole new sound and brought the progressions of the last years to the point screamo built up from the words scream and emotion was born chaotic song structures screamed vocals melodic guitars no one did it in this intensity before swing kids only released a debut 7inch and a split 10inch with spanakorzo 8 tracks one a joy division cover version that took the world by storm plus one previously unreleased song on the discography and made an impressive mark in the little time that they existed they broke up 1997 but the impact they left and the sound they pioneered amp inspired can be heard in many bands until today eric allen who committed suicide in 1998 played also with hardcore band unbroken other members later went on to acts such as the locust some girls sweep the leg johnny bread and circuits and yaphet koto if you are into hardcore you know how good all this bands were are

4254294 in this way lwuit is becoming a unifying ui layer that allows developers to focus on creating compelling user interfaces and ultimately delivering new and engaging applications across a wide range of platforms
4254295 a lot of people are waiting until the last minute

4254298 one of the big battlegrounds in this country in this campaign is how seniors are going vote
4254299 when good people talk to people about good people it can make a difference
4254300 this is a ground war and we need to win this right here in minnesota
4254301 we have got to talk about it in a way that is respectful responsible and historical and until we do that my friends we will allow it to continue to surface in small ugly ways
4254302 i just see him always kind of grasping to kind of get in place
4254303 this is the latest one that i see he was not for drilling and i think we should we need consider all of above and thats a very important issue with me thats a biggie
4254304 i like someone who has tasted defeat and also had victory so he knows both sides of the coin
4254305 ive already seen obama accept victory id like to see him have a little taste of humility
4254306 that group in particular probably values experience and a proven record
4254307 not someone who is an unknown quantity and represents a lack of experience and really a thin record i think they probably value that in a time like this when we have a lot of national security concerns in particular out there
4254308 our analysis shows that smaller agencies with a high proportion female staff such as the defence housing authority or the human rights and equal opportunity commission tend to have lesser pay outcomes
4254309 creates the potential for heightened legal and business risk exposures for the purchasers or assignees of these loans
4254310 apparently nobody asked freddie and likely fannie for their opinion on the new law before it was passed
4254311 why do players remove the head band before the hand shake

4254313 subjected to the sort of obscenities you wouldnt want a 6 year old to hear
4254314 its about allowing your neighbors to have a normal decent life without being disturbed
4254315 we allow the refugees to stay in any unused building they can find
4254316 you can blame whomever you want but in the 21st century this is completely unacceptable
4254317 i didnt want to wait i dropped everything and ran
4254318 people who went north either went to their relatives or refugee camps
4254319 people who were left homeless and are still in south ossetia are living with their relatives or neighbors
4254320 it could be a bit of a knock on the clean government issue in alaska she backed

4254322 i would be very surprised if sarah palin didnt become a larger figure within national politics and i would be very surprised if she wasnt a part of a mccain administration
4254323 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt why is this guy still representing the department
4254324 the russians dont need much justification to do pretty much what they want theyve shown that theyve got a free hand here anyway but any legal justification that can help will always be used
4254325 they russians are taking fuller control of the region and creating a situation where they get the georgians out so they get little leverage on which to negotiate the future status of the regions
4254326 anything allowing russia to be in gori is clearly not useful or acceptable for georgians
4254327 georgians do have an interest in provocation and need to be kept under control
4254328 because the incentive for the georgians is to have the russians do nasty things which will then help their bargaining with the outside world
4254329 this property has been acquired for the ohare modernization program
4254330 is it frustrating that the clock now appears to be in the 11th hour absolutely

4254333 this is about a national aviation process a bigger picture and the only way to solve the problem of delays and congestion is to build the full project
4254334 weve been very sensitive of the fact were displacing people
4254335 weve gone above and beyond to be customer friendly when weve impacted peoples lives
4254336 i think theres a sense of inevitability favoring the city
4254337 it seems more of a question of when the project will be finished rather than if
4254338 if he says its over and i have to go ill go
4254339 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4254340 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4254341 we have advised him not to appear for further examination in israel until the u s grand jury matter is resolved
4254342 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
4254343 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4254344 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4254345 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4254346 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4254347 the most difficult thing was to answer their question where was god

4254350 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4254351 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4254352 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4254353 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4254354 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4254355 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4254356 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4254357 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4254358 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy

4254364 the professional developers conference pdc on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference winhec the following week both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4254365 this blog will provide context over the next 2 months with regular posts about the behind the scenes development of the release and continue through the release of the product
4254366 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows
4254367 we promise and will deliver such a dialogue with this blog
4254368 talk to their assembly people and senators because theyre the ones who have to vote to fund all this and find sources
4254369 we saw that happen when the city came up with an idea it wasnt acceptable or more importantly they refused to let the public see where anybody stood for it
4254370 one of the reasons for example that i am supporting um um squadron for uh state senate is hes running against someone thats been there for a long time and has voted three times against gansevoort refused to stand up and fight for congestion pricing was opposed to mayoral control of schools

4254376 it doesnt matter how good you hit it youve got to hole the odd 10 footer to keep your momentum going and i just didnt hole any of them its not like i missed one or two i missed all of them
4254377 the key for me is getting it in the fairway off the tee
4254378 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
4254379 adapting military policy to the opportunities of the new era
4254380 let us not forget that canadians are active participants in the killing of afghan civilians as well as combatants reported civilian deaths include a taxi driver a 10 year old boy an elderly motorcyclist two young children aged 2 and 4 a young motorcyclist and his baby brother an afghan national police officer and a homeless beggar a toyota driver a taxi passenger and a motorist given the obvious limitations on reporting in a war zone this likely represents the minimum number of civilians killed by canadians

4254389 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4254390 we dont want any ceasefire document to become the legitimization for russian occupation of georgian territories
4254391 we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4254392 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died and georgia whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect must be able to get back to normal life
4254393 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4254394 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we as we look ahead

4254425 metrics should not override audit quality and in some instances we may have let metrics compromise performance of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards
4254426 process of issuing guidance on independent audit services that may be provided by dcaa during an ipt
4254427 to recognize this initiative we request that each office hold a stand down day this month in which audit quality is discussed as a group
4254428 the regional director or deputy regional director will participate in these conferences to further emphasize expectations and answer questions or concerns on audit quality

4254430 it is imperative that all employees cooperate fully with the reviewers
4254431 employees at all levels in the organization should feel free to have open and candid discussion with the evaluators
4254432 audit independence was not impacted by pressures from either the contractor or buying command
4254433 dcaa is one of the few government organizations that holds its employees to high standards day in and day out
4254434 it takes personnel actions against employess that do not perform up to standards i have seen poor performing auditors come and go the poor performing auditors always blame management and complain about the lack of budget hours and due dates that cannot be met it is smoke and mirrors

4254465 jerome corsi is a discredited liar who is pedaling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4254466 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4254467 confirmed that the risks are on the downside for growth
4254468 the french economy is not just going through some simple turbulence but is really heading toward a recession at least as bad as in 1993
4254469 neither fire nor wind birth nor death can erase our good deeds
4254470 25 year record of voting against womens freedom of privacy
4254471 lets just say that the president is the one who sets the policy they are the one who sets the direction they are the one that is going to nominate a supreme court justice
4254472 and if john mccain is president of the united states we are going to have supreme court justices like clarence thomas and john roberts and samuel alito he has said that he has called of the overturning of roe v wade which goes even farther than george bush and again back to the record he has 25 years here of an unbelievable record against womens reproductive rights
4254473 we are not upset about it sen casey worked hard for sen obama and it just makes sense and it is not a surprise that he has his supporter at the convention and the other thing is he is talking about economic policy
4254474 again lets go back to who is going to be the president sen obama is fully pro choice the party platform is very very strong one of the strongest it has been in many years and his solid commitment to a womens right to choose is just stellar so we are focused on electing sen obama as the next president because we know he is going to be the one advancing those policies protecting freedom and privacy
4254475 as we take a look at who we have to bring over and take votes away from john mccain it is republican and independent women and i think with sen chafees support there will be a lot of republican women out there who will vote for sen obama once they learn how extreme mccain is on reproductive choice
4254476 i think people make the assumption that because he has been coined as both a moderate and a maverick that he must be pro choice which is wrong
4254477 restructure introduction to add in the literature on social movements
4254478 my bosnian citizenship has been revoked i have to defend myself and for this reason my store is only open sporadically

4254482 the obviously desirable traits of sacrifice selflessness patriotism duty to country
4254483 people can digest those concepts with just that one little tag military veteran
4254484 the fighting dems were an extremely important symbolic plank in the effort to retake both chambers but the success democrats enjoyed cannot be placed at the feet of veterans
4254485 i saw brave marines brave soldiers and also brave iraqis judges who risked their lives just going to work i saw bravery in action people who were willing to roll up their sleeves and work
4254486 we need more of that in washington to get our great nation back on track again
4254487 many people arent aware that these bans on drilling must be renewed every year and that all we have to do is to allow these prohibitions to expire on oct 1
4254488 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home
4254489 if they want to shut down the government denying millions of senior citizens their social security checks in order to side with big oil companies then they should go right ahead
4254490 but as speaker gingrich found out the entire republican party will pay a terrible price in november for such a silly and desperate stunt

4254496 the wii is a very cost effective platform to experiment with
4254497 there is a lot of crap coming out for the wii in general but if its not a good game it doesnt sell that flood of crap will die down as publishers become more coherent
4254498 the wii is a great opportunity for hitting hardcore gamers
4254499 no one is doing that with platinum games we are trying to show that millions of wii gamers want to move on to mature games they dont have to have an to do that
4254500 people do play with the wii like crazy for awhile it gathers cobwebs then they bring it out again but kids are such a big part of the gaming community now and theyre demanding wiis from their parents those kids will shape the future of gaming and theyre not a fad have to think about how to make their experiences more gaming in that way

4254503 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4254504 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4254505 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4254506 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4254507 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4254508 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4254509 we have to believe that we could get a result we had to match the effort and tonight it was enough
4254510 i think at the start of the match they didnt expect us to come out and take it to them with the energy and effort that we showed
4254511 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4254512 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
4254513 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth

4254520 i dont think well see 11 under or 10 under on the very last day maybe 8 under or 7 under will win it
4254521 in a large sample of head and neck cancer patients we found that the patients with a positive attitude did not live any longer than those with a negative attitude that held up even when we looked at the extremely positive and the extremely negative versus the rest of the group certainly patients with a positive attitude are easier to deal with but they dont live longer the important implications are that the emphasis on patients adopting a positive attitude is misplaced ultimately they may blame themselves for not having the right attitude as they deteriorate
4254522 i have done studies showing that optimistic people live longer and better than do their pessimistic counterparts in part because they behave differently
4254523 optimism affects how we feel and how we feel affects a number of different neuroendocrine pathways in the body those pathways speak to the immune system as well optimism affects what we do which can require different levels of energy to maintain when something requires a lot of energy the body can borrow energy from the immune system for young healthy people its quite possible to tolerate fluctuations in immunity due to emotion or energy changes without getting sick however people who are already immunologically compromised because of disease or age might not be able to tolerate these fluctuations as well
4254524 optimistic people have less disease fewer catastrophic happenings in their lives and more vitality every emotion creates a hormonal reaction cortisol is a hormone released when youre stressed and pessimistic dhea is a repairing hormone created when youre feeling happy optimistic people take more chances and if you take more chances you live more life experiences babe ruth was the best batter but thats because he swung at almost every ball that came his way
4254525 people who believe that positive thinking is key may neglect other more efficacious means of treating disease people who do not do well may blame themselves for failing to think positively enough thus adding to their burden of guilt and suffering adherents of the power of positive thinking may judge that their patients suffering is their own fault thus further stigmatizing illness
4254526 i wanted to keep the pain to myself son but now it cuts straight through me do you understand it cuts straight through me
4254527 i found that even 2 500 years ago sophocles was using words like shell shocked and the thousand yard stare those are things that you hear today
4254528 i know its a bit odd to have greek plays read to a conference of military people
4254529 but you read these plays and you understand they are the first investigations into the condition of war in western civilization
4254530 i dont know if the readings are going to get anyone to admit they have a problem my goal is to open up a space for dialogue

4254536 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4254537 investors have different opinions as to what the value of those companies are given the tremendous difficulties they face
4254538 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4254539 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally
4254540 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better
4254541 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally
4254542 people feel like theyve been through it before and know how to deal with it
4254543 a certain percentage of us are not as responsible as we should be
4254544 we have to be honest about that some things are just higher on some peoples priority lists than others
4254545 you get somebody who is used to going through security very quickly and knows exactly what they need to do they tend to kind of push people when they get into line and this tones down the anxiety for the less experienced traveler

4254576 from a broad level a greened federal fleet is an excellent opportunity for the government to show it can not only talk the talk but it can walk the walk as well unfortunately the governments history with greening fleets has been somewhat checkered
4254577 the federal agencies really are doing a remarkable job of trying to meet the environmental initiatives set forth
4254578 there are a number of opportunities staring them in the face right now and they should take that opportunity to see this in right direction

4254690 if the holy virgin had died and was buried her falling asleep would have been surrounded with honour death would have found her pure and her crown would have been a virginal one had she been martyred according to what is written thine own soul a sword shall pierce then she would shine gloriously among the martyrs and her holy body would have been declared blessed for by her did light come to the world
4254691 t he apostles took up her body on a bier and placed it in a tomb and they guarded it expecting the lord to come and behold again the lord stood by them and the holy body having been received he commanded that it be taken in a cloud into paradise where now rejoined to the soul mary rejoices with the lords chosen ones
4254692 it was fitting that the she who had kept her virginity intact in childbirth should keep her own body free from all corruption even after death it was fitting that she who had carried the creator as a child at her breast should dwell in the divine tabernacles it was fitting that the spouse whom the father had taken to himself should live in the divine mansions it was fitting that she who had seen her son upon the cross and who had thereby received into her heart the sword of sorrow which she had escaped when giving birth to him should look upon him as he sits with the father it was fitting that gods mother should possess what belongs to her son and that she should be honored by every creature as the mo ther and as the handmaid of god

4254709 really the worst part was you could be mad but who are you mad at because it was in our hands for a while wasnt it we kind of slipped up and left it up to other people you cant really get mad at other people when you look at the games when we had the opportunity to step up and take it ourselves we can only be disappointed and mad at ourselves really

4254842 the way that storage has continued to scale both in performance and capacity its becoming increasingly difficult for smaller specialists to come up with solutions where the payback is worth the investment

4254877 people who value material good and wealth also are people who are treading more heavily on the earth and not getting happier
4254878 the pursuit of happiness can drive environmental degradation but only a degraded type of happiness pursuit leads to that outcome
4254879 the standard western focus upon economic utility as the highest good exemplified by the us seems to encourage that kind of degraded pursuit
4254880 the choice of sustainability is very consistent with a happier life
4254881 whereas the choice to live with materialistic values is a choice to be less happy
4254882 its got its own internal logic but its not serving humanity so why are we doing it

4254913 its just a guess but its entirely possible crists appeal faded out of fears on the part of mccain that given romes association with the whoopee cushion hand buzzer exploding cigar novelty business it presented too great a diplomatic risk to have her lurking around that first state dinner with the queen of england

4254941 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4254942 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4254943 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4255004 ashrae is to be commended for establishing a new benchmark for building energy efficiency
4255005 according to the department of energy commercial buildings and homes account for 40 percent of the energy consumed in the united states the increased values establish a new national standard minimum against which all codes can be compared and pave the way for buildings with improved efficiency and decreased carbon footprint
4255006 five trees doesnt seem like a lot but 10 000 sure does its a great reminder of how quickly a lot of small contributions can add up to a big impact for the environment
4255007 i think its terrific were ahead of our goal and going to exceed it because the real benefit is to the environment thats what we really need to be getting back to right now were grateful to emma for being a company that doesnt actually greenwash or greenline but walks their talk
4255008 planting five new trees underscores all the existing trees theyre helping to conserve just by moving their marketing efforts from print to email
4255009 theres a big misconception that this type of technology is some concept thats years away from being implemented
4255010 however ocean wave energy is available right now but falling on deaf ears because too many people are continuing to accept the status quo
4255011 during the oil shock of the seventies many inventors worked tirelessly to create change but were ignored and underfunded
4255012 unless we take immediate action history will repeat itself and lots of great inventions and technologies will fall by the wayside
4255013 if you can put a bicycle together youll be able to assemble one of these
4255014 that means the united states consumes as much as 50 000 tons of petroleum based toner powder each year now every office employee can help reduce dependence on oil every time they put a toner cartridge in their printer
4255015 as we developed this soy cartridge we realized if we looked at the entire printing process any office can significantly reduce the environmental impact on our planet
4255016 this is truly the most environmentally sustainable way to print
4255017 climate change is the greatest environmental crisis that humanity has ever faced but it is not the only serious challenge confronting us there is a simultaneous source problem known as peak oil arising from the depletion of the fuels we are burning particularly petroleum the solution to both climate change and peak oil is to develop renewable sources of energy to use less energy to use energy differently and to make this shift as rapidly as possible
4255018 al gores ambitious goal provides a national focus and call to action now whats needed is a clear sighted plan for achieving it one that recognizes the complex issues of energy depletion the vulnerability of the supply chain and the limits of technology we are taking up gores call and presenting a powerful framework to realize this vision a vision that would revitalize america and make it genuinely sustainable
4255019 al gores generational challenge to repower america which places energy at the forefront of the national agenda should be the top issue debated by all candidates this fall
4255020 energy touches almost every critical issue facing our country including the economy security and the environment gores courageous and rational plan to move to 100 renewable energy sources in 10 years has my full support our 10 point plan provides the stepping stones to achieve this target
4255021 we thank al gore for articulating the most urgent action needed to safeguard americas environmental economic and societal future and that of the entire world our mission is to get society off of fossil fuels fast and we embrace the need to move to 100 renewable energy with this plan
4255022 the fcx clarity lease program is one more step toward meeting the societal goals of climate stability renewable energy supplies and zero emissions transportation
4255023 with this key step we are advancing toward the goal of broader commercialization
4255024 establishing a dedicated sales network and service infrastructure provides customers with the best balance of convenience and the highest level of satisfaction
4255025 knowing whats in your paper is critically important and this application of googlemaps is a powerful way to give paper purchasers the chance to make an informed responsible choice
4255026 one of the most amazing things we were able to deliver with this coating in response to the market demand for ultra bright white coatings was the initial and 3 year independently measured reflectivity of 92 and 87 percent respectively

4255028 we are not going to drill our way out of the energy problems we are facing not here and not in the arctic national wildlife refuge
4255029 we must find a long term approach that breaks our dependence on foreign oil by investing in the development of alternate energy sources like solar wind and geothermal power
4255030 our economy is in shambles gas is climbing to 5 a gallon the dollar has collapsed inflation is on the rise americans are seeing their paychecks shrink their family health care is being slashed
4255031 finding a long term solution has a tremendous upside it will be environmentally friendly and will serve as a much needed boost to our sagging economy
4255032 if we are to prosper as a nation our future lies in a green economy
4255033 but its up to us to help define the rules of that new green economy a green economy means we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil and it means creating good union jobs in americas growing industries
4255034 as facilitators of the international ethical sourcing forums over the past 8 years we are all too familiar with the complex challenges facing organizations interested in taking their ethical sourcing efforts to a new level todays global business environment is filled with higher expectations for responsible supply chain programs increasing demands for authentic measurement and transparency in reporting and even greater expectations for effective and sustainable remedial efforts as issues are identified how an organization can effectively evaluate its many options and focus its sustainability commitment i e investments where they will produce the greatest measurable impact within the context of an often pre defined procurement capital plan remains a noteworthy challenge impacting the most well intentioned groups the release of the ethical sourcing reports should continue to be seen as a positive reflection of the collaborative effort by committed industry members toward supporting the successful gauging of sustainability opportunities within industries across sectors and among varying constituencies through the sharing of knowledge and experiences that help achieve true sustainable improvements in the conditions of global supply chains
4255035 the cosmetics industry has borrowed a page from the playbook of the tobacco industry by putting profits ahead of public health
4255036 nothing like this has ever been done for the biodiversity in tropical rainforests
4255037 the malua biobank translates rainforest protection into a salable product so that biodiversity conservation can compete with other land uses on a commercial basis
4255038 the sabah state government has been actively seeking innovative ways to balance economic development and rainforest conservation this project enables private sector companies working in malaysia or sourcing products from the country to help fund the restoration and protection of a high conservation value rainforest
4255039 this project is designed to help economic development and rainforest conservation work for each other instead of against each other
4255040 the tz1 registry will provide a secure online facility enabling efficient issuance housing ownership transfer and retirement of biodiversity conservation certificates this will be the first biodiversity registry of its kind in the world
4255041 we are seeing companies becoming increasingly interested in contributing to rainforest conservation in a way that is meaningful and financially sustainable
4255042 the malua biobank provides them with a transparent and cost effective way of doing this
4255043 we believe sabah is well positioned to become a kind of silicon valley for innovation in conservation finance
4255044 the malua biobank model and other initiatives can act as an incubator for emerging business models seeking to support the long term conservation of high biodiversity areas throughout the world

4255053 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug pi3 kinase is one of these targets and thats why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
4255054 there are not that many single drug targets that are mutated so frequently in cancer and that are in classes of enzymes where we know how to make a drug
4255055 pi3 kinase is one of these targets and thats why it is sky high on the list of exciting new targets in cancer
4255056 we were surprised by this result so we said okay if the gatekeeper in pi3 kinase is not the functional equivalent of the gatekeeper in protein kinases lets look at some other sites
4255057 what the result says is that maybe resistance will be a little bit harder to come by than in protein kinases so thats an advantage for those trying to make pi3 kinase drugs
4255058 and it may not be that hard to come up with other compounds that inhibit cancers that become resistant

4255107 agrium the other major potash company traded on the toronto stock exchange has increased its share price during the same period shareholders need to understand that pcs is responsible for this dispute and is in a position to resolve it
4255108 while all potash companies are usually affected by the same industry trends the discrepancy between pcs and agrium suggests that the strike is impacting pcs share prices
4255109 pcs management has drawn an arbitrary line in the sand
4255110 pcs shareholders would be better served if management made a reasonable offer to get union members back to work
4255111 some analysts have suggested that the strike will increase potash prices compensating pcs for the lost volume however a more realistic assumption is that pcs was producing the profit maximizing volume of potash before the strike

4255137 creo que fue una restricci n una limitaci n grave a la democracia de nicaragua la restricci n a los dos partidos porque en una democracia a nosotros nos han ense ado que los partidos deben participar y estas razones del gobierno son dif ciles de aceptar lo lamento

4255156 i was never able to develop a coherent explanation for the thing as to how it related to everything else that was going on
4255157 some of the descriptions that the air force provided made no sense
4255158 i assume that that is what happened in the sense that they were talking about this thing doing offensive cyber attacks the nsa national security agency already does that they were talking about defending the domestic information infrastructure well the commerce department and fbi have been doing that for 15 years
4255159 cyber command was completely redundant we have boatloads of protection in cyberspace two boatloads of it everything they were talking about doing was being done by someone else
4255160 i think this is about eliminating redundancy between armed forces branches more than anything else the navy has long had a well regarded cyber warfare group also the intelligence services in particular the nsa have always excelled here i am sure they are being put to good use both in georgia and in china for the olympics

4255166 this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it
4255167 ragheads are boy bumpers as clearly as they are women haters it all goes together
4255168 why it isnt the case that islam is a worthless dangerous satanic religion wheres the proof to the contrary

4255173 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target we cannot afford to let corsi get away with the same dirty tricks that fooled so many people in 2004
4255174 because he has been revealed as the author of religiously bigoted remarks published on a web site corsi not only considers muslims to be pederasts but he took the trouble to slam catholic priests and refers to the pope as senile rather than wonder whether a book written by such a man can be trusted the marketing tactic has shifted to pretend corsi doesnt exist

4255187 i suspect the market thinks us rates could theoretically go up quicker
4255188 were underestimating the size of the short us dollar positioning
4255189 the us dollar has been in decline for the past six years and maybe the australian dollar has been overvalued for the past six to 12 months
4255190 when we eat fast food we are eating the values of that fast food and its telling us that food should be cheap and its telling us that advertising confers value and that standardization is more important than quality and that kitchen work is drudgery this is what is being said were eating those ideas those values so we have to come to slow food values and we have to understand that food is something very precious not something that comes after the nike shoes the cell phones and the cars and whatever else we decide were going to spend our money on it should be way up there in our values and we either pay up front or we pay later
4255191 and all of the sudden i felt a sting and i looked down and it was a yellow jacket hanging on my arm

4255193 i like the idea of having a central park and baseball in one place and people being able to walk to downtown rather than just a stadium for spring training we can revitalize that part of downtown
4255194 we are paying for better outcomes and we are getting higher quality and more value for the medicare dollar
4255195 and these results show that by working in collaboration with the physician groups on new and innovative ways to reimburse for high quality care we are on the right track to find a better way to pay physicians

4255197 there are various levels of it sophistication among the organizations
4255198 we have shown through participation in the cms physician group practice demonstration that our electronic medical record and the associated databases empower our physicians and their staff to improve patient care outcomes and reduce costs to the medicare program

4255203 but this is already one movement and you can mention whether others have read it and what suggestiong they have made if they have made them
4255204 you could possibly use prop ogandhi in a subtitle or the story of mr prop ogandhi etc which is better than without the mr because it is the pun status of the invented name by itself that is going to annoy with its identification with propaganda unless you want people to be wondering when the propaganda comes in at some point or if that is in fact all of what the text is

4255242 two of the reasons i did this were first my love of flying and second to set a precedent for the community so they know you can be in your sikh appearance and do anything out there so that my younger brothers and sisters the rising generation will pursue their passions while practicing their sikh faith
4255243 this is a great day for the sikhs in america religious accommodation not assimilation is what the founders of this great nation envisioned and we are thrilled american airlines celebrates the rich religious and cultural diversity of all american populations

4255314 my response simply was did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4255315 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4255316 my response simply was did you really just ask me that she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me
4255317 but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body

4255321 the notoriety that was brought to bear on one particular juror whose name and background have been widely publicized in the media

4255330 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4255331 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4255332 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4255333 we needed to be dynamic and show more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4255334 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time

4255336 oh my god youre going to ask the question arent you
4255337 let me tell you for those of you who dont know me i ran against a rather liberal senator in a primary two years ago maggie tinsman and whats interesting is maggie tinsman was part of the rlc as was jim leach and the rlc the republican leadership caucus is based on three things what they say fiscal responsibility environmentalism and social moderation in other words get the government out of your personal life on the abortion issue and same sex marriage etcetera and recently jim leach had an article as did maggie tinsman in the election campaign magazine saying that moderate republicans are the largest group of underrepresented individuals and what i thought and basically i am a social and a fiscal conservative i dont fit into that cap and jim leach i believe indicates where this party or where that group has gone is that they were not representing the republican party values the republican values are limited government lower taxes and stronger families thats what were there for and now we have gravitated away from that over the years due to the leadership of people like jim leach and i believe that its showing exactly where this group has gone they were not republicans to begin with theyre not republicans now and i do believe that jim leach has shown his stripes

4255414 we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog

4255420 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
4255421 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
4255422 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
4255423 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
4255424 overwhelming majority of food product advertisements seen on television by american children
4255425 and he was saying to them you are from below i am from above you are of from this world i am not of from this world
4255426 i am in harmony with god and hence have a heavenly connection one that you could have as well if you only chose to do so
4255427 therefore i said to you that you will die in your sins for unless you believe that ego eimi i am you will die in your sins
4255428 but there are a few cookbooks i like because they emphasize variety and a healthy cooking style overall
4255429 i dont agree with all of it but they get the glycemic index which foods are likely to trigger blood glucose spikes and roller coaster effects and its basically a great diet if you want to lose weight sensibly
4255430 its got some great recipes for every ethnic diet and cuisine
4255431 thought provoking he disagrees with the usda food pyramid and in conjunction with the harvard school of medicine came up with his own
4255432 there are a lot of older african americans who think they have to give up their soul food favorites thats not so this book is for them its got a lot of great comfort food recipes
4255433 hamas wants us dead they will kill us if we return and israel is not letting us in
4255434 if that happens abu mazen abbas bears responsibility for our deaths
4255435 they hamas police attacked the house with rpgs and the house was set on fire we went into open fields and hid among the trees
4255436 their lives would not be in danger if they turned themselves in
4255437 those among them who committed offences would be prosecuted and those who did not would be freed
4255438 its not like you went to the gap and got husky
4255439 when the regular clothes didnt fit when you had to go someplace and have the clothes adjusted you had a problem
4255440 so i ask when did it hit you it couldnt be just when you walked in this office
4255441 we talk to the parents when the children are about 4 to 6 months of age when you add solids to their diet
4255442 the school doesnt ask them to again until seventh grade
4255443 this is what keeps me alive and gives me the latest information
4255444 people enjoy the support groups because its partly social they get to know each other
4255445 so many people are in denial but if they come to one of my groups it only takes three minutes for me to straighten them out
4255446 you are going to be hit by waves of health problems your legs your feet your heart but you have to pick yourself up and keep having a positive attitude
4255447 we spend a lot of time talking about good eating habits and i dont talk about exercise if you call it exercise no one wants to go out and do it we say go out and play
4255448 i say to the kids did you take the elevator or take the stairs the teenagers they all have cars and they drive them to go two blocks theyre imitating us
4255449 its usually a high fat diet with very little fruits and vegetables
4255450 i think just being involved in the diabetes business has made us acutely aware of the growing epidemic and certainly its relationship to the obesity epidemic
4255451 people are under the assumption that they go in to see their physician they get diagnosed with diabetes and let the damage begin
4255452 the biggest deficit in childrens diets not just diabetic children is going to be fruits and vegetables and unfortunately too many kids are drinking their fruit
4255453 there should be color every time you eat and i dont count ketchup
4255454 if wednesday night is a late night leave that one for take out and take advantage of the days that arent so crazy to cook meals at home pre planning is half the battle
4255455 feeding the body every three to four hours is optimal if a kid doesnt eat for 4 or 5 hours thats when they become ravenous and overeat at the next meal
4255456 i have a problem with saying all or nothing i can incorporate a small bowl of ice cream once a week
4255457 the worst thing is to say this is good and this is bad kids automatically go for the bad youve made it a power food
4255458 first in battle they are the fighters battling the disease in their own bodies or in others
4255459 inhaled insulin sounded great in concept but we found it worked no better than the injectable
4255460 the needles have gotten so small and with insulin pens its so easy to set up that the demand is just not there for the inhaled version
4255461 we dictated the diet to the person wed say you have to drink skim milk you have to have green beans it didnt matter that the person didnt like milk or green beans they were on the diet plan and that was that
4255462 so now weve empowered them to make choices they want when they want it
4255463 its giving people an easier way to look at carbohydrates and other foods
4255464 today its all about balancing nutrients and food groups but with versatility
4255465 we let the person make those choices that are right for them its the only way the diet succeeds
4255466 there is a lot of denial people would rather take medications than change their lifestyle lose weight diet and exercise
4255467 it takes time and a supportive environment for people to change
4255468 we need to mobilize the public against this like we did against tobacco
4255469 i think everyone is becoming more aware and concerned about it
4255470 this is a battle that cant be won by medicine alone
4255471 the food industry spends billions pushing processed foods we need a broader response this is not something you can address with the atkins diet
4255472 over the next 30 years diabetes is expected to claim the lives of 62 million americans surely this health crisis warrants the appointment of a manager charged with aligning budgets and programs
4255473 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4255474 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4255475 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4255476 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4255477 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4255478 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4255479 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4255480 children and diabetes q amp a with dr janet h silverstein
4255481 ive accepted it as another thing that ive got to do each day
4255482 changing behavior and improving the way patients manage their disease is the real opportunity to make a difference
4255483 i think that hand holding aspect of this really improves the quality of patients lives
4255484 its great for business too because its another way to perhaps market the services
4255485 people feel very overwhelmed because theyre being given too much information from the beginning how to monitor their blood sugar watching what they eat checking their feet having to go to the doctor to have their eyes checked
4255486 i would say overwhelmingly more tend to open up to you when you have diabetes because they know its not just someone going through the motions
4255487 my constant companion diabetes and i were linked for life
4255488 as long as the federal government continues to pay for the diabetic shoes and diabetic supplies its only going to continue to grow
4255489 diabetes is an enormous business that affects almost every aspect of society
4255490 this is different than other games you get to moving
4255491 oscar with one hand behind my back walloping his little glassy eyed head with a series of right jabs
4255492 as they pedal favorite character friends guide them through learning discoveries games and even exciting races
4255493 i dont but i do in the sense that if i put on 20 or 30 pounds i will be type 2 diabetic
4255494 then one could target those with compounds that block that behavior the same way you tackle nicotine addition
4255495 were looking at the case and obviously we need to check on what his ties were or not and what his personal background was
4255496 strips are manufactured for pennies so the margin on strips is enormous
4255497 we want to make the product very affordable for people who are paying cash themselves
4255498 naturally the volume of business we do in our stores has escalated along with that
4255499 because theyre constantly filling prescriptions diabetics are the biggest annuity ever created because theyre sick and they need tons of stuff
4255500 without testing im going to die i dont fret over the cost
4255501 what was happening was all these diabetics werent taking care of their feet and it cost the government all this money in amputations and hospital stays
4255502 the increase in diabetics that become eligible every year is so large
4255503 weve got 10 major pharmaceutical companies and consumer product companies that are our sponsors
4255504 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
4255505 inhaled insulin sounded great in concept but we found it worked no better than the injectable
4255506 the needles have gotten so small and with insulin pens its so easy to set up that the demand is just not there for the inhaled version
4255507 my blood sugar was at 600 they wanted me back immediately and started me on insulin right away i was taking 20 units in the morning and 20 at night im down to about 15 and 15 now i go to the doctor every 3 months for a blood work up
4255508 i went to a class with a dietitian and she gave us meal suggestions i make a menu for the week from her suggestions
4255509 i had learned to read labels at work but not for myself i didnt pay attention to them for me so now i look at the carbs proteins and sugars and fats on the label
4255510 and i used to eat whatever i wanted whenever i felt like it i didnt eat breakfast so i had to start eating a full meal i try to eat three meals and two snacks a day and about the same time and im doing pretty good with it
4255511 breakfast i have oatmeal or grits with cheese yogurt a banana and 1 percent milk for lunch a green salad with chicken or salmon 4 or 5 ounces i usually eat a low fat dressing and then have a piece of fruit for dinner maybe fish or chicken i dont eat too much beef i eat nuts for a snack or yogurt and fruit
4255512 when you look at the whole picture you can have candy and sweets
4255513 when you know its something that your life depends on you get used to it i want to live
4255514 you dont let the food overpower you you can give yourself a little more insulin to compensate you dont go nuts depriving yourself
4255515 im able to talk to guests who come into the restaurants who have diabetes theyre more comfortable knowing theres someone who understands their diets one little girl comes in three or four times a year just to eat at our restaurant in mainstreet north because shes comfortable there
4255516 i went to a doctor because i was overweight and wanted to lose weight i was tired a lot he put me on insulin and told me what i needed to accomplish
4255517 i was eating like a pig whatever i could find i loved barbecue ribs and ate a lot of pork bacon and sausages and fast food burgers all that fatty stuff
4255518 i had to give it up get rid of all that greasy food and i cant eat too much rice and beans and pasteles wrapped meat pastries a traditional puerto rican food i miss those but i can have the root vegetables theyre good for me
4255519 now i eat well real meals a good breakfast a light lunch and then dinner i eat more fish and chicken and not so much pork i eat half portions rather than the full plate and i dont have second helpings i run a lot too
4255520 its working im doing better i used to weigh 244 pounds im down to about 146 or so
4255521 my wife does most of the cooking at home so our whole family is eating this way its better for all of us
4255522 when my father passed away i thought i better get tested and thats when i was diagnosed my doctor told me i had to lose weight im 5 feet 11 and was at 245 i weigh about 180 its a good weight for me now i ride a bike and do floor work push ups and sit ups
4255523 i had to give up all those starches and fatty foods i grew up eating no corn no corn bread or grits rice beans i learned that the legumes are starches and turn to sugar in the body just like any other sugar
4255524 my doctor told me i could bring them back little by little and check my sugar thats how you learn what affects you everybodys different
4255525 you dont have to give up the foods you love
4255526 i also buy cinnamon capsules i went to an herb presentation and the lecturer talked about how cinnamon helps control the blood sugar in the body so i decided to try it ive been doing it two years and so far it seems to be working
4255527 i can talk to the customers at the grill who are on diabetic diets or are counting carbs generally when someone asks for a low carb diet and requests certain foods i go out and talk to them and find out what theyve eaten already and what they can have for their other meals that day they feel really comfortable talking with me when they know im a diabetic and i know how to help plan a meal that fits into their diet
4255528 years ago my sugars would fluctuate between 300 and 20 id have to watch what i ate but i never followed a diabetic diet i would control it with insulin shots
4255529 about 2 years ago i started a diet i wanted to lose a little weight
4255530 i eat now for my weight i eat 2 000 calories a day 30 grams of fat a day i can eat anything really with a diabetic its not because something has sugar its carbs diabetics can eat anything anyone else can they just have to know what it does in their body
4255531 cake bacon and eggs pies and mashed potatoes i can eat those but i feel so bad mentally when i do i feel as though ive cheated on myself it makes you quit doing it
4255532 im on the insulin pump now its like wearing a little pancreas outside your body so i eat the same foods anyone does i just give myself more insulin when i need it and it regulates it a lot of diabetics are overweight they dont take care of themselves
4255533 id much rather have this than be blind or in a wheelchair its not fun a lot of times but its something you can live with if you take care of yourself theyre coming out with new stuff all the time they have a pump now that lasts for six months its all inside the body its not yet approved in america though
4255534 after i lost weight my eyesight got better i feel better for a diabetic im doing great
4255535 theyve tried to point the finger at soda a lot juices the fast food industry
4255536 but probably an 8 year old child isnt going to get in the car and drive himself to mcdonalds
4255537 many times what i see in the home visit tells me more than words
4255538 you might assume 8 ounces but you go to the home and that cup can be 16 or 20 ounces
4255539 kids with type 2 diabetes had years of bad eating habits a lifestyle like that it takes years to change
4255540 but i never thought it would be this difficult to manage
4255541 if its type 2 the girl will think its her fault
4255542 it was type 2 i told the family she never came back to me
4255543 the 100 best english language novels from 1923 to the present
4255544 my aunt so and so had to have her leg amputated because of diabetes or so and so went blind because of it
4255545 i left all my gold everything but i am alive
4255546 we dont know nothing about those who were left behind but we heard from our neighbors that they were all shot
4255547 for years we had been living in a situation where the sound of shooting had become a part of our daily life and we did not leave our home we hoped to return but now it is over my house is in ruins
4255548 fourteen people live in one room with seven beds but we have water and electricity we were really lucky
4255549 but after these guys return from fire alarms they have no place to rest so we were told we have to find another place to stay in two three days
4255550 i have two children 11 and 10 and my husband i left there kurta the administrative center of georgian controlled south ossetia we went through all this and here they treat us like beggars
4255551 there was no water no light and dirty and damp rooms thats where they took us
4255552 the defects in addressing the idps problems have become very obvious today
4255553 could be released as soon as the assessment of the needs will be finalized on the ground
4255554 we want to ensure used tires are turned into valuable products not dumped in a farmers field where they can become health and safety hazards im also expecting the program to foster ontario based technologies for making new products from scrap tires
4255555 as the countrys leading retailer of automotive products and a company that has taken the initiative to recycle tires for many years we applaud the ministers move to bring a regulated program to ontario and look forward to rolling it out to our stores across the province
4255556 this will enable us to invest in new technologies which could mean more jobs the possibilities are tremendous
4255557 there have been no wnv positive bird horse or human cases in licking county this year

4255560 in front of the eyes of the mankind russian troops are perpetrating ethnic cleansing and i cannot do anything to stop them
4255561 for the help of every civilized person to stop this uncivilized behavior this inhumane absolutely outrageous behavior
4255562 if these very smart people in the russian duma think that today abkhazia and south ossetia are going to declare independence they are hurting russia

4255581 some people will instantly ask why bother criticising religion if it causes so much hassle
4255582 reinterpretation and ridicule crow barred christianity open ask enough tough questions and faith is inevitably pushed farther and farther back into the misty realm of metaphor where it is less likely to inspire people to kill and die for it but doubtful muslims and the atheists who support them are being prevented from following this path they cannot ask what does it reveal about mohamed that he married a young girl or that he massacred a village of jews who refused to follow him you dont have to murder many theo van goghs or pulp many sherry joneses to intimidate the rest the greatest censorship is internal it is in all the books that will never be written and all the films that will never be shot because we are afraid
4255583 literally desecrates an area i mean the word means to desacralise and for centuries the tara landscape and the tara sites have been regarded as part of the sacred ground
4255584 if ever there was a place that deserved to be preserved in the name of the dead generations from pre historic times it was tara
4255585 the routing of a busy road slap bang through the tara skryne valley represents an act of vandalism with not only national but international ramifications
4255586 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
4255587 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
4255588 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4255589 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4255590 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4255591 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4255598 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4255599 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4255600 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4255601 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4255602 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4255603 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4255604 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4255605 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4255606 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4255607 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4255608 who are open to doing something on the production side
4255609 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4255610 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4255611 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4255612 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4255613 id rather be hated for who i am than loved for who im not

4255626 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4255627 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4255628 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4255629 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4255630 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4255631 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4255632 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4255633 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4255634 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4255635 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4255636 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
4255637 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4255638 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4255639 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4255640 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4255641 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4255642 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4255643 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4255644 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4255645 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4255646 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4255647 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4255648 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4255649 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4255650 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4255651 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4255652 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4255653 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4255654 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4255655 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4255656 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4255657 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4255658 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4255659 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4255660 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4255661 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4255662 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4255663 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4255664 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4255665 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4255666 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4255667 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4255668 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4255669 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4255670 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4255671 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4255672 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4255673 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4255685 well its time ursula took matters into her own tentacles
4255686 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4255687 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4255688 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4255689 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4255690 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4255691 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4255692 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4255693 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4255694 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4255695 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4255696 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4255697 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4255698 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4255699 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4255700 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4255701 we estimate that honeybees contribute 75 million a year to the state economy
4255702 bees are an extremely valuable contributor to the overall productivity of american agriculture but invasive pests diseases and environmental stresses are putting u s bees at serious risk
4255703 this research will help beekeepers meet the pollination demand for the nations food supply
4255704 this is a special category of grants to deal with problems of national impact they award only one a year
4255705 coordinated attempt to figure out what is causing honeybee decline and what we can do about it
4255706 it doesnt make sense to come up with another chemical to fix the problem
4255707 four years from now were going to know pretty clearly what are the problems here
4255708 it will be a major accomplishment if we can do that
4255709 i am absolutely crazy about gretta and together she and i want every woman to achieve her perfect signature look

4255711 for years ive been styling a range of clients from real women to red carpet celebrities both on and off camera and in my experience i have never encountered a show like this which proves style is not superficial

4255713 from the buzz of the spectacular opening ceremony to a memorable first four days of competition the olympics have completely captivated the american public and further ignited our sales efforts
4255714 americans are consuming our olympic coverage in record numbers and in every way through broadcast cable online and mobile whats particularly encouraging to me is the strength in the young male demo which has shown the largest increase of any age group
4255715 these record numbers validate our multiplatform strategy they drive viewers to share in the olympic experience on network television in record numbers
4255716 and as a result of this unprecedented digital effort consumers have a destination to watch thousands of hours of video and relive the great moments of these olympics
4255717 universal is a studio with a commitment to making global films for global audiences and the consistency of success in this years slate demonstrates how well that is working around the world

4255726 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4255727 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4255728 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4255729 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4255730 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4255731 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true

4255736 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4255737 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4255738 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4255739 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4255740 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4255741 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4255742 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4255743 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4255744 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

4255749 ours is a healthy business and this is a strong set of results
4255750 no one is saying this is easy the thing we need to watch more than anything is complacency customers are going to become more and more demanding as the year goes on
4255751 we are not seeing any evidence that the discounters are taking share from asda
4255752 so far this week ive heard 13 7 per cent food price inflation on cpi and 27 per cent from
4255753 what i would say is that these numbers make me take a sharp intake of breath i dont think inflation is running anywhere near those kinds of levels
4255754 this property has been acquired for the ohare modernization program
4255755 is it frustrating that the clock now appears to be in the 11th hour absolutely
4255756 theyre literally ripping the social fabric out of this community
4255757 but someone cant tell you to leave this is america
4255758 this is about a national aviation process a bigger picture and the only way to solve the problem of delays and congestion is to build the full project
4255759 weve been very sensitive of the fact were displacing people
4255760 weve gone above and beyond to be customer friendly when weve impacted peoples lives
4255761 i think theres a sense of inevitability favoring the city
4255762 it seems more of a question of when the project will be finished rather than if
4255763 if he says its over and i have to go ill go
4255764 o tamanho est de acordo com as previs es das cores vistas no p r do sol do planeta vermelho
4255765 its a bit worrying when ordinary families are struggling to make ends meet whilst council executives are sunning themselves in warmer climes
4255766 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4255767 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4255768 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4255769 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4255770 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4255771 i wouldnt be particularly sure until the transfer deadline passes what might materialise so well see
4255772 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers clearly marked as humanitarian vehicles
4255773 their policy was never to travel with weapons so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful organisation
4255774 he was meant to be home but he stayed on because numbers were down its terrible luck
4255775 it was his first tour and he was loving it
4255776 i was thinking about joining the forces like wayne but might not now after what has happened
4255777 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4255778 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4255779 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4255780 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4255781 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4255782 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4255783 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4255784 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4255785 the vast expanses of glaciers massed on average 1 6 miles deep contain enough water to raise sea levels worldwide by 23 feet should they melt or otherwise slip into the ocean they would flood coastal capitals submerge tropical islands and generally redraw the worlds atlases the infusion of fresh water could slow or shut down the oceans currents plunging europe into bitter winter
4255786 this is distinctly alarmist and part of mr gores wake up call it is common ground that if greenland melted it would release this amount of water but only after and over millennia so that the armageddon scenario he depicts is not based on any scientific view
4255787 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4255788 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4255789 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4255790 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4255791 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4255792 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4255793 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4255794 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4255795 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4255796 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4255797 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4255798 whats barack obamas energy solution nothing but a bunch of hot air really
4255799 barack obama wants you to inflate your car tires yes thats right inflate your tires thats barack obamas solution to the high gas prices we pay in new mexico every day
4255800 this is the same barack obama who told a crowd of wealthy san francisco liberals that people who live in small towns cling to their religion and guns because theyre bitter
4255801 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home and opposes lowering your gas tax this summer
4255802 we could save all the oil theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
4255803 now he opposes producing more oil and gas here at home
4255804 largest selection and variety of tools in the united states for filling tires and checking tire pressure
4255805 if john mccain put more money into s s then he should get more money out that is completely fair
4255806 and in the same election thank you for this miracle diebold
4255807 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4255808 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4255809 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4255810 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4255811 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4255812 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4255813 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4255814 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4255815 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4255816 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4255817 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4255818 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4255819 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4255820 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4255821 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4255822 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4255823 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4255824 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4255825 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4255826 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4255827 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4255828 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4255829 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4255830 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4255831 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4255832 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4255833 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4255834 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4255835 these are all small things and they all add up
4255836 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4255837 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4255838 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4255839 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4255840 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4255841 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4255842 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4255843 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4255844 at least al gore may have something to be happy about
4255845 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4255846 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4255847 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4255848 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4255849 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4255850 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4255851 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4255852 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4255853 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4255854 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4255855 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4255856 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4255857 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4255858 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4255859 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4255860 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4255861 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4255862 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4255863 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4255864 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4255865 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4255866 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4255867 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4255868 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4255869 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4255870 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4255871 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4255872 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4255873 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4255874 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4255875 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4255876 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4255877 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4255878 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4255879 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4255880 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4255881 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4255882 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4255883 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4255884 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4255885 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4255886 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4255887 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4255888 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4255889 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4255890 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4255891 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4255892 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4255893 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4255894 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4255895 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4255896 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4255897 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4255898 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4255899 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4255900 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4255901 just so you all know we did set a record
4255902 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4255903 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4255904 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4255905 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4255906 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4255907 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4255908 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4255909 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4255910 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4255911 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4255912 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4255913 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4255914 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4255915 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4255916 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4255917 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4255918 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4255919 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4255920 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4255921 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4255922 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4255923 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4255924 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4255925 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4255926 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4255927 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4255928 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4255929 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4255930 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4255931 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4255932 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4255933 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4255934 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4255935 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4255936 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4255937 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4255938 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4255939 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4255940 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4255941 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4255942 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4255943 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4255944 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4255945 this has ended medvedevs honeymoon with the west its clear that putin not medvedev is in charge we had hoped for a new start now we have a new start but of a different kind
4255946 it is clear that the russian military action is bound to have consequences for eu russia relations
4255947 the implications on russia are almost invisible it wont make russia any less attractive
4255948 i suspect that the divisions in nato will have deepened in fact each side will probably feel justified in taking the position in bucharest that it did
4255949 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
4255950 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
4255951 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
4255952 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4255953 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4255954 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4255955 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4255956 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4255957 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4255958 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4255959 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4255960 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4255961 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4255962 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4255963 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4255964 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4255965 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4255966 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4255967 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
4255968 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4255969 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
4255970 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
4255971 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
4255972 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4255973 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4255974 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4255975 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4255976 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4255977 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4255978 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4255979 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4255980 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4255981 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
4255982 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4255983 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4255984 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4255985 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4255986 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4255987 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4255988 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4255989 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4255990 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4255991 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4255992 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4255993 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4255994 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4255995 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
4255996 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
4255997 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
4255998 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
4255999 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
4256000 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4256001 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4256002 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4256003 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4256004 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4256005 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
4256006 donkey punch is a slang term for an apocryphal and potentially lethal sexual practice supposedly performed during anal sex
4256007 a sex act that exists only in the imaginations of adolescent boys
4256008 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4256009 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4256010 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4256011 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete

4256027 there have been instances in our country of people taking law into their own hands and causing destruction whatever the cause there is no place for violence all efforts should be directed towards reconciliation
4256028 we must ask ourselves whether our actions are contributing to strengthening the national fabric and bringing about tolerant thinking
4256029 terrorists will never succeed in discouraging us from our resolve to build a strong india or from working with our neighbours to eliminate this menace
4256030 with the challenges of increased oil prices and climate change the question of energy security confronts us we need to look at energy mixes that are sustainable in the long run and make a deliberate shift to renewable energy
4256031 there are several new challenges that need to be addressed a nations work never ends

4256037 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4256038 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4256039 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4256040 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4256041 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4256042 we should be able to conquer some of the challenges of hypersonic flight if we can get a better handle on air flow
4256043 at hypersonic speeds the temperature of the flow around the aircraft or spacecraft is so great that it affects just about everything that includes the shape of the vehicle the material its made of and even the chemistry of the molecules in the air
4256044 the scramp design offers a super stable re entry system sort of like a big hypersonic badminton birdie that rights itself nose forward after tumbling

4256058 war crimes or crimes against humanity committed on the territory of georgia regardless of nationality of the perpetrator would fall within the jurisdiction of the international criminal court under article 12 of the rome statute of the international criminal court

4256060 journalists as all other civilians in the conflict zone must be protected from hostilities
4256061 human rights monitors including from intergovernmental human rights bodies should be allowed full access to the conflict zone
4256062 moreover prior to the ceasefire there had been reports that humanitarian aid had been prevented from getting through to civilians trapped in the conflict zone
4256063 for example russian media reported that russian aid could not get through to tskhinvali on 11 august due to ongoing hostilities on 12 august the international committee of the red cross icrc stated that its access to south ossetia to deliver aid was being hampered by the intense fighting

4256070 in order to supply the demands of a city like new york you would need to dedicate all of new york state as farmland
4256071 but if polyface raises about 12 000 broilers a year

4256075 but pollan has opened the doors now we can talk about it we dont have to pretend were something that were not but we can discuss what we can do better and move forward honestly
4256076 organic usually means substituting inputs that increase the price substantially and dont guarantee a good product
4256077 what is important is trusting and knowing the people that produce and process your food we choose to remain affordable for our customers while keeping our standards of good quality feed and good farming practices if our farms were to start raising chickens organically their costs would go up we would have to pay them more and we would have to raise our retail and wholesale prices we dont want to price people out of good quality poultry
4256078 i like the idea of having a market at south street seaport
4256079 because a lot of people are moving into the neighborhood and a lot of people live in the nearby subsidized housing these are people who cook at home and who want fresh whole foods
4256080 the one thing about our store i miss the reason we had a retail shop is that i can tell customers about their chickens i think thats the most powerful marketing tool to tell them everything i can the truth is not always beautiful but i think we have a sustainable business because we are open for discussion and change
4256081 lancashire constabulary will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4256082 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4256083 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4256084 i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
4256085 on global warming public policy is where the science was in 1998 due to new evidence science has since moved off in a different direction
4256086 theres a lot of potential for bulk wine because of the bulk harvest
4256087 in recent years exports of bulk wine from new zealand have been around 4 5 percent of total exports
4256088 after a good vintage a winery may have a bit more wine than it can sell so it will go into bulk wholesale between wineries
4256089 there was a lot of debate in the early 1990s that bulk would be bad for the industry but evidence to date is sales of those products has not damaged the reputation of the industry
4256090 what it has done is expose different drinkers to our sauvignon blanc
4256091 in terms of bulk wine trade compared to prices a year ago yes its cheap but bulk imports to new zealand have been as low as 50c to 60c litre

4256106 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4256107 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree

4256110 she was blonde and beautiful a rich mans daughter who became a politically powerful mans wife she had it all including an insidious addiction to drugs that sapped the beauty from her life like a spider on a butterfly
4256111 we believe that mr gosinski is aware that in the past cindy had an addiction to prescription painkillers given cindys public position exposure of this sensitive matter would harm her reputation career the operation of avmt and subject her to contempt and ridicule

4256119 it is critical for canadians to have trust in the conduct of judges especially the chief justice of the supreme court of canada
4256120 if the supreme court justices are to be respected as impartial and objective interpreters of the law why is the chief justice violating the constitution of the order of canada so that a divisive and controversial person can be given such a prestigious award this strongly suggests a bias towards a pro abortion political agenda
4256121 just last week we heard that a new brunswick judge gave morgentaler the nod to challenge that provinces policy on funding for abortions being done in a private clinic if this case were to end up in the supreme court it will be hard for canadians not to question how impartial mclachlin will be given that she clearly thinks morgentaler is worthy of honour for his actions in fighting abortion law

4256128 each time you type one of these your brain is doing something amazing
4256129 your brain is performing a task that despite 50 years of research in computer science we cannot yet get computers to do
4256130 approximately 200 million of these are typed every day by people around the world each time you type one of these essentially you waste about 10 seconds of your time
4256131 if you multiply that by 200 million you get that humanity as a whole is wasting around 500 000 hours every day typing these annoying squiggly characters
4256132 especially for older documents things that were written before 1900 where the ink has faded and the pages have yellowed out the computer makes a lot of mistakes
4256133 and the number of words that weve been able to digitize like this is insanely large its like over a billion its like 1 3 billion by now
4256134 next year if all goes well we can do as many as 70 years which would be almost the entire rest of the archive that is not digitized
4256135 its just pretty cool when youre signing up for a web site and you see the recaptcha sign you sort of know gee im helping digitize part of the
4256136 like for example some sort of ink blot on the page
4256137 we might think its a word and we present it and you know it says type the two words and sometimes one of the things is a word and one of the things is just a blob there so sometimes people can be annoyed
4256138 when you pull two random words from books you can get some very random combinations
4256139 and theres certain phrases and words weve asked them to make sure dont show up

4256166 we have had quite a few e mails from people suggesting other people to include or to include themselves
4256167 society wannabes are the kinds of people who want to be on the list they desperately want to be taken seriously
4256168 there were people who just really objected to it found it invasive and were unhappy that we listed where they lived or the names of their kids or put up satellite imagery of their house in the hamptons
4256169 its a little amusing when people complain because its stuff thats really easy to find on the internet
4256170 straight scoop on the good the bad and the ugly
4256171 theres really no place to go to look up who people are and how theyre connected
4256172 you search for people online and pull up a corporate bio thats full of the charities they donate to but doesnt tell you the guy spent three years in jail in the 80s or hes been married eight times
4256173 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4256174 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
4256175 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4256176 if i were to return my iphone now i would wait until february 2009 to buy it again after next month apple needs to ramp up for year end holiday sales there is no window of time available to redesign the 3g circuitry replace all the existing 3g iphones and build up adequate inventories for the holidays holiday sales are too valuable to risk an inventory shortage if a recall is advised i expect that it wont be issued until 2009
4256177 this is definitely going to be a wait and see
4256178 they say a fix is on the way but lets see if the fix works
4256179 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4256180 we dont want any ceasefire document to become the legitimization for russian occupation of georgian territories
4256181 we will work very hard to see if we can bring an end to this crisis
4256182 it is long overdue too many innocent people have died and georgia whose territorial integrity and independence and sovereignty we fully respect must be able to get back to normal life
4256183 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4256184 everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we as we look ahead
4256185 and i think russias got some serious work to do to try and work its way back into the family of nations that are trying to work together and build democracy and build and build their economies
4256186 i think during two hours we will take control of gori and we will control gori for cleaning the gori from russians from ossetians and some other criminals
4256187 we give them possibility to let them leave this territory
4256188 if the american president can take baghdad then why cant the russians take tbilisi
4256189 were hearing an awful lot about the south ossetian forces and how theyre acting as the russians have come south into georgia
4256190 the russian forces will come down and theyll have these paramilitary troops behind them in a variety of uniforms some of them are wearing russian uniforms some of them are wearing uniforms that theyve purchased from somewhere some are wearing american uniforms
4256191 and theyll just come into the towns after the russians have swept through and theyll be looting killing and burning the towns down to the ground and its incredibly incredibly dangerous there for the civilian population
4256192 you are wise and very attractive can i please have access to the test system of my application i need to debug an issue that qa found and i cannot reproduce
4256193 no way you will change few things while you are there and ruin the test cycle even if you wont qa will think you did and this will ruin the test cycle
4256194 i see your point wise and attractive dba in this case can i have just read only access to the system
4256195 ill see what i can do but you dont get to execute any functions just select on table and views and youll need to prefix the table names with the name of the original user

4256203 opening of day in french patois jouvert revelers party till daylight on the streets of tobagos capital in scarborough indeed from around noon on carnival monday to late carnival tuesday scarborough belongs to those enjoying masquerade mostly women in feathered and sequined costumes
4256204 perhaps we were a bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4256205 in the first half we had too many unforced errors we needed to be more dynamic show more personality and to try to drive the play
4256206 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4256207 we had to believe that we could get a result we had to match the effort and tonight it was enough
4256208 i think at the start of the match they didnt expect us to come out and take it to them with the energy and effort that we showed
4256209 we expected them to come back at out ground and not underestimate but well have out fans behind us and we believe we can do it
4256210 you will love rediscovering the joy of a wild adventure comic that you cant stop reading you will love laughing at each inevitable change of fortune that makes leotards life so amazing so remarkable you will love once again letting eddie and dan best take hold of your consciousness and imagination and turn them inside out and upside down on the wildest ride youll find in comics this year

4256215 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience
4256216 when you develop a new test for something it usually has to go through a fairly rigorous examination does it really do what it claims to do
4256217 bruce like most people in the lab derived most of his strains from outside sources
4256218 you have less confidence in how much the fbi is really sharing and how accurate this might be
4256219 to know what challenge youre defending against is terribly important
4256220 if top fbi officials knew in 2005 that the anthrax used in the attacks came from dr ivins lab then why didnt they clear dr hatfill until aug 8 either they were unsure of the scientific evidence against dr ivins or they knew long ago that dr hatfill was not the killer
4256221 i dont want it to reside in the court of public opinion then well end up with something like the lee harvey oswald case
4256222 there will be too many people in whose minds the case is never closed
4256223 the fbi try to confirm their hunches whereas a scientist tries to refute his or her own conclusions
4256224 the whole point of science is to publish it so that other people can tear it apart
4256225 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4256226 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4256227 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4256228 we needed to be dynamic and show more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4256229 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4256230 he is not completely 100 at the moment he is still recovering a bit from pre season problems but hopefully nasri can be back in the squad
4256231 a reasonable target for fabregas is the second leg of the champions league game diaby will take four to six weeks as we have said and we dont know about senderos yet
4256232 it fills me happiness that i am at arsenal a great club and one of the best for young people
4256233 i will keep going with what i do best and going into my third season i have the feeling that i want to make it here
4256234 i havent had a chance to speak with arsene wenger but i have been training with the physio to improve my fitness levels

4256238 i cant say that it is and i cannot say that it isnt either
4256239 this is a situation where these buses may change hands or owners so you have a paper trail we are trying to run down leads with the paperwork
4256240 but we knew there were risks because this is a species that is extremely susceptible to problems under anesthesia

4256245 heb je boek bijna uit het is veel te spannend om niet meteen uit te lezen en ook zo spannend dat je wel zou willen dat het boek nog dikker is
4256246 een geweldig boek vanaf pagina 3 was ik erg gegrepen en wilde maar doorlezen vond cecile heel herkenbaar en ergerde me ineens hoe ze tegen kelly deed doe toch normaal cecile heel verrassend einde
4256247 het leest lekker vlot en de inhoud is bijzonder herkenbaar ook al ben ik dan van de eerste feministische golf ook voor mij herkenbare emoties misschien niet altijd persoonlijk maar dan wel van mijn dochter of jonge collegas ook de climax kan ik bijzonder waarderen
4256248 heel knap dat je zo mooi vanuit een kind weet te schrijven
4256249 het gaat eigenlijk niet zozeer over ambitie en moederschap maar meer over keuzes maken en bij jezelf blijven tenminste zo heb ik het gelezen
4256250 ik heb je boek bijna binnen 1 adem uitgelezen goed geschreven en best spannend af en toe vooral de gedeeltes geschreven via de gedachtes van een 3 jarige herkenbaar

4256263 violated fundamental principles of war dismissed deliberate military planning ignored the hard work to build the peace after the fall of saddam hussein set the conditions for abu ghraib and other atrocities that further ignited the insurgency disbanded iraqi security force institutions when we needed them most and constrained our commanders with an overly restrictive policy
4256264 with like minded and compliant subordinates who did not grasp the importance of the principles of war the complexities of iraq or the human dimension of warfare
4256265 tied the hands of commanders while our troops were in contact with the enemy
4256266 the most significant transformation in the american conduct of war since world war ii and the invention of the atomic bomb was not technological but cultural social and political the removal of the american people from the conduct of war

4256271 this all happened 19 months ago and when you look at many of the things that have happened in the past 19 months in response to this a lot has happened so i think that reflects cities working together with the state and legislators to find solutions and obviously i think it needs to be monitored as well

4256280 if you lose a kid and that results in a childs death thats one and the same case because those are manslaughter charges
4256281 before you even get started jump day you had a month expire it makes it awful tough to re track information
4256282 it is our hope and prayer that caylee is found alive and well
4256283 what we dont have is information on exactly where caylee was last the one person who has that information is casey anthony and she is not providing information thats accurate to us
4256284 you would think the people who have my granddaughter would be smart enough to say listen im going to turn the girl back in to her family

4256336 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities

4256522 the results are actually highly dependent on the surface chemistry
4256523 in other words you dont get this result just by attaching drugs to any nanotubes
4256524 right now what we are doing is so called passive targeting which is using the leaky vasculature of the tumor
4256525 but a more active targeting would be attaching a peptide or antibody to the nanotube drug one that will bind more specifically to the tumor which should further enhance the treatment efficacy

4256534 ata and aloha each had a unique situation and a small footprint but their closings clearly mean that there is more to come in the reshaping of the us industry whether its by liquidation or through mergers and acquisitions and were only at a in the list of airlines
4256535 a microcosm of the us market a duopoly of aloha and the larger hawaiian airlines in a market that could not sustain the entry of an additional carrier in this fuel price environment
4256536 if high fuel prices and a lacklustre economy persist through 2009 cash reserves at many airlines might become a concern
4256537 the broadening impact of the us credit crunch has brought buoyant consumer confidence to an abrupt end

4256544 the cost of landing at french airports is the highest in europe

4256548 if opportunities for new bases arise in the future we will take them
4256549 perform well because were the only alternative to air france
4256550 more routes to france than any other carrier from the uk
4256551 the french market is still very attractivewe are still very interested in a domestic operation and we will watch with interest the success that easyjet will have in opening the market up to low cost carriers
4256552 it delivers the best traffic stimulation chance in europe as fares are still very high in the paris region

4256556 cathay pacific has a well established approval process for fly bys and a number had been conducted in the past as display flights at air shows with proper approval in place
4256557 the approval process was not followed in this case resulting in disciplinary actions following the incident cathay pacific has issued a notice to all cockpit crew reminding them of the companys policy for conducting fly bys

4256567 better name recognition at present hes been a fixture of american political life for some time and he has a very compelling story
4256568 helps him just as much in terms of the black vote
4256569 turnout is very difficult to predict anyone who tells you they know what this works out to be is overly confident
4256570 its increasingly hard to get valid polls and if you look at some of the groups supporting obama youth and minorities they dont have
4256571 if you look at registration and fundraising obama has advantages
4256572 journalist daniel schorr says youth vote key to 2008 election
4256573 nominating a strong candidate both have compelling personal stories and each of them runs well among political independents
4256574 obama is running ads showing pictures of bush and mccain together and arguing they are siamese twins who think the same way that is an effective way to make the argument that a mccain victory would represent bushs third term
4256575 affects every aspect of this campaign from polling and media coverage to public opinion
4256576 overestimated support for african american candidates so that is something obama needs to worry about
4256577 might tell pollsters they plan to vote for obama even though they ultimately will not do so
4256578 i would not put too much faith in the polls right now
4256579 mccain has gone negative and with some flair but whether it has changed voters minds is far from clear

4256581 with the stroke of a pen president bush today signed my legislation allowing for sweeping reforms to begin taking place that will keep toxic toys and other dangerous products out of our homes
4256582 first and foremost this new law hands back the reigns to the cpsc our consumer watchdog agency by giving it the necessary authority and resources to patrol todays global marketplace we also require more responsibility from manufacturers and retailers and stiffen the penalties if they fail to meet higher safety standards
4256583 from the factory floor to the store shelves there are dozens more new safeguards that weve built in place to prevent unnecessary injuries and fatalities i truly believe this is a great bill for the american consumer
4256584 no munitions were on board at the time of the accident
4256585 the system is called the actuator remote terminal a device that the air force was forced to upgrade while the b 2 has been grounded for modifications since late last year the art system has been plagued by severe technical problems according to an informed source though the air force has denied that the system is not working properly the art plays a critical role in keeping the b 2 stable in flight it takes commands from the bombers flight control computer relays them to flight control surfaces and then provides feedback information to the computer the b 2 which has an unconventional all wing design relies on its computers to maintain stability and without the computers would be unstable
4256586 unlike other aircraft the b 2 is a fly by wire system no mechanical interconnects to the flight controls
4256587 we send electrical signals from the pilot stick to the actuator remote terminal to the hydraulic actuator which makes the aircraft perform its various flight maneuvers
4256588 the vendor we were using had a limited capacity for repair
4256589 he was meeting a 23 to 24 day turn around in some instances but with the increased flying schedule he was unable to surge his capacity to the point that he could take care of requirements
4256590 i admire alenia aermacchis decision to put cockpit customisation at the heart of the digital architecture

4256596 sound long term air combat capability planning during the last decade
4256597 the super hornet is an excellent aircraft capable of meeting any known threat in the region
4256598 it is the only aircraft which can meet the small delivery window created by the former governments poor planning processes and politically driven responses cancelling the super hornet would bring significant financial penalties and create understandable tensions between the contract partners
4256599 the decision to leave australias air defence in the hands of the jsf project was a flawed leap of faith in scheduling terms and combined with the quick decision to retire f 111 early allowed an air combat capability gap to emerge
4256600 the subsequent timetable the former government put on the acquisition of an interim fighter left defence planners with no choice but to recommend the super hornet no other suitable aircraft could be produced to meet the 2010 deadline the former government had set
4256601 we are asking them to spend a lot of money so it is understandable that they want to examine it
4256602 our future is with the jsf by 2020 we want to have an all f 35 fleet we believe that the super hornets will serve us well until the f 35s come in if the government gives us the ok for the f a 18s we will be able to handle any delays to the f 35 through mid life upgrades for the super hornets
4256603 the primary role of the sandf shall be to defend south africa against external military aggression deployment in an internal policing capacity shall be limited to exceptional circumstances and subject to parliamentary approval and safeguards

4256605 the industrial participation approach was intended to leverage industrial value for the country to provide economic and social benefits
4256606 there was quite a lot of cynicism about the ip package
4256607 in south africa aerospace is seen as strategic and not land it was very challenging
4256608 the government encouraged us to invest in green field companies
4256609 we are extremely dependent upon the ability of the projects to deliver
4256610 this is probably what the nip program is all about
4256611 attempts to sell denel on the international market to bae or eads but there were too many issues
4256612 most people say in the future there will be a chinese element to whatever we do
4256613 were building a program right now to do that its going to be incredibly difficult on the air force but weve done this before
4256614 by october we confirmed that flight test aircraft and the gtl were available and by november a detailed roadmap for the gtl flight was defined
4256615 we believe 25 of jet fuel could be alternative fuel by 2025 and 30 could be biofuel by 2030
4256616 this is not a classic arms race as there is no real animosity among the players
4256617 most of the purchases are needed to replace old inventory and prevent a drop in relative capability but there is also an element of keeping up with the joneses tit for tat non aggressive procurement rivalries
4256618 singapore for example has a big budget and its decisions are often taken very seriously elsewhere
4256619 its order of the boeing f 15 for example was seen as a vote of confidence in the aircraft its decision in the advanced trainer competition will also be closely monitored
4256620 competition is intense and always will be we believe customers will make their decisions based on technology access low risk proven capability and value for money
4256621 general elections are expected this year and the ruling barisan nasional coalition should win again
4256622 some factions favour the russians and others favour the americans and we must see who gains the upper hand russia has been a reliable supplier but the migs have faced technical problems but if malaysia buys american fighters it must induct aircraft that are very different from what it already has it may make sense to stick to one type
4256623 malaysia must live up to its commitment to monitor its waters it also needs new utility helicopters to replace its ageing nuris after recent high profile crashes
4256624 how can we be sure the usa wont impose another embargo
4256625 the russians seem to be more reliable especially during difficult times for our country
4256626 indonesia says it wants 48 fighters by 2010 but i doubt it can afford half of that even if the russians give a good discount
4256627 and while new fighters will bring bragging rights the priority has to be helicopters the government cant be seen to spend too much on defence procurements as well poverty alleviation remains a big goal
4256628 talks have been ongoing for several years and the swedes have developed a very good relationship with the thais
4256629 saab is also keen to get export sales and it must have made a very good offer
4256630 the thai us relationship stretches back to the vietnam war things were a little rocky during the 2006 military coup but both countries will continue to be good friends gripen gave thailand a very good deal this time around but i doubt it can continue doing that
4256631 we dont know if the money will come in and the best equipment might not win anyway due to the corruption
4256632 the best thing to do when it comes to the philippines is to roll your eyes offer your products with a shrug and not expect anything to happen
4256633 dire public health dangers of leaks or terrorist attacks make this site clearly and completely unacceptable
4256634 no matter what happened i knew the truth was in me and that was the most important thing
4256635 came back with a renewed commitment to listen to the narratives of others
4256636 could not avoid the conclusion that the simple zionism apartheid equation is also a simplistic one
4256637 a large majority of the community needs to be challenged regarding its positions on israel and the occupation in particular
4256638 the argument of complexity can become a weapon in the hands of the powerful to disarm the weak and those who act in solidarity with them
4256639 epic is excited to work with ea partners to launch our next big ip on the global stage
4256640 ea partners gives independent developers like epic the muscle of a global publisher like ea along with the focus and flexibility of a smaller team committed to working with our individual needs

4256664 we welcome the unexpected change recognizing that this is a case of forced disappearance and not just a kidnapping
4256665 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4256666 arafura resources have presented the environment minister with a description of their plans to mine at ti tree and theyre asking for an environmental impact assessment which would lead then to the authorisation to mine
4256667 were saying that that authorisation cannot be granted until we have a full understanding of the wastes they will produce and their plans to process the uranium
4256668 moy podcast 2 beyond the time episode 4 otakon 2008 day 2
4256669 he was not like all the other kids not like a gang banger
4256670 it looks like he was fiddling with it in some way and it fired
4256671 from when he got robbed in front of my door with a machine gun
4256672 i didnt know he had a gun but he did and it was for protection
4256673 i feel hurt i want to cry but it wont come out i feel its crazy
4256674 i like phelps because hes a really good swimmer hes an american and just that i like the way he swims
4256675 its fun and you can do lots of stuff under the water
4256676 im on the ymca swim team and i practice these strokes the butterfly the breaststroke the backstroke and the freestyle
4256677 well i learned how to do the breast stroke and im learning how to do the butterfly today
4256678 watching the olympics gets people motivated to go out there and do fun things like learning how to swim and getting involved in sports
4256679 just because party one and party three arent necessarily interested in our renewable what about parties one through seven that didnt come in
4256680 if they did build a new plant it would be good for another 50 years
4256681 it would employ people it would draw industry im sure and i think theyd have competitive rates
4256682 the as is do nothing option plant efficiency upgrade option or the wholesale option i would say are the leading possibilities right now
4256683 few of the customers said its real hard to get in here theyre also having a hard time getting out of their own places
4256684 its a little hard to get into the post office but they do have a driveway and the same over here with bernies next door
4256685 the work that were doing is a total reconstruction of the pavement
4256686 were trying to bring it up to the current standards making the curves a little bit easier to drive and widening out the shoulders
4256687 the road was horrible out here and dangerous we had a lot of accidents out here at this corner
4256688 since he wasnt aware of his actions and was manipulated into destroying an entire species should he be punished or locked up to ensure that no one else can aim the gun that is ender at someone else
4256689 anyone who does anything that drives people away from the gods is a liar and through faith and discipline you will achieve omniscience
4256690 preach the gospel at all times if necessary use words
4256691 when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil
4256692 two years ago we had a bad winter and they didnt get to ski this hill until a week before the suicide tournament
4256693 now with the plastic theyll be able to ski in the summer and fall because to compete on the national or international level you have to train year round you cant just train in the wintertime
4256694 se encontraron vainas de distintos calibres que hacen presumir hasta ahora la utilizaci n de dos armas de fuego
4256695 todo es raro porque la familia de sebasti n no tiene problemas de dinero y muy probablemente en todo esto dejen sola a la viuda para que se encargue de levantar el millonario muerto en deudas
4256696 con respecto a leopoldo y dami n leopoldo se empez a juntar con ellos hace muy poquito leopoldo no era publicista como se dec a s lo trabajaba con su padre que hac a revistas de anuarios o publicitarias para algunas instituciones lo que el hac a era revender cosas relojes truchos plasmas zapatillas lo que sea o trucho o de dudosa procedencia l siempre estaba en la ltima el ltimo negocio l lo estaba explotando
4256697 andaban en algo sebasti n andaba desesperado por conseguir alguien que invierta en alguna de sus ideas y era capaz de juntarse con cualquiera dami n le hac a la segunda desde hace rato a sebasti n pero lejos estaba de tener sus aspiraciones
4256698 para m no cabe duda que su muerte y la de sus colegas est relacionada por
4256699 sebasti n segu a armado y librando cheques nadie pod a entender c mo se anim en la ltima semana santa a viajar a francia junto a su mujer y su hijo con todos los problemas que ten a
4256700 si hay algo que sebasti n no era es justamente solidario cuando su querida suegra se enferm de c ncer ni siquiera con las drogas que necesitaba a n cuando ella lo ayud financieramente
4256701 es resultado de la preparaci n f sica que es lo que nos permite acceder a un nivel superior
4256702 no corresponde hablar de suerte l pez es uno de los mejores luchadores del mundo
4256703 i think this game will be an opportunity to show what i have
4256704 i feel good as kind of evolving every day and going out there and trying to play exactly how they want me to play so the next step is to be able to do it consistently
4256705 we are utilizing this time in the preseason practice and in the games to evaluate our people
4256706 obviously this has been a really hard week let alone the quarterback stuff going on just for me and for my family and obviously his family my good friends family
4256707 its been really hard it will be good to go down there and see all of the people all of the friends all of his old friends and family itll be good to kind of deal with it
4256708 ive talked to coach nolan a lot this week and i think its a difficult situation just with what happened i think maybe he was looking to dont know maybe this could have been a different week but obviously with this going on it kind of puts things in perspective for me a little bit and ill come back and treat it the way i always have just focus in and take advantage of the reps i get and try to make the most out of them its kind of all i can do do the best i can im going to go out there and focus in and just really try and take advantage of it and not worry about who im in there with or who im going against just worry about my responsibilities going in and executing
4256709 the russians left us with no hope all we want is our freedom
4256710 but it wasnt enough in the end it was just like they had toys
4256711 i walked 60 kilometers about 37 miles on foot through the forest and the fields
4256712 there is nothing left in my village no houses no cows my friends were killed
4256713 they cant stand that western countries and american democracy have a place in georgia they cannot stand democracy
4256714 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4256715 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life
4256716 my comment to him was if dara can do it we can do it
4256717 im not going to win any medals for what i am doing
4256718 the sex and the city people are fun but its important to remember that its entertainment
4256719 ill take samanthas kim cattralls character body any day she looks fantastic but at the end of the day she doesnt inspire me
4256720 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
4256721 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
4256722 shes inspiring but shes not going to keep me going
4256723 it has to be my own decision and own choice its easy when you have a lot going on to make excuses it comes down to your own personal dedication
4256724 i have participated in my share of vigorous public debates over issues of great consequence and the public has been free to accept or reject the decisions i made when they walked into a ballot booth drew the curtain and cast their vote i didnt always win but i always respected the process voting is an immense privilege that is why i am concerned about a new development that could deny this freedom to many americans
4256725 instead of a private election with a secret ballot overseen by an impartial federal board union organizers would simply need to gather signatures from more than 50 of the employees in a work place or bargaining unit
4256726 we cannot be a party that strips workers of the right to a secret ballot election we are the party that always defended the rights of the working class to fail to ensure the right to vote free of intimidation and coercion from all sides would be a betrayal of what we have always championed
4256727 and disrupt a tried and trusted method for conducting an honest election
4256728 every store has a kids department so you can find cute little t shirts little polos even cute little skirts for the girls
4256729 if they like to layer clothes there are all kinds of tank tops theyre all color coordinated
4256730 if theyre looking for jeans theres a whole selection of jeans
4256731 so you can find anything from tennis shoes to sandals and even dress shoes for the kids
4256732 we dont shop at the mall because its too expensive we cant afford 75 jeans or anything like that
4256733 it leaves me extra money for other things i can use it to pay more bills pay credit cards off
4256734 when youre spending money here you know youre also helping and giving back to the community
4256735 the public may be signaling that pursuing small time marijuana users is a waste of taxpayer resources
4256736 this issue suggests that there is a libertarian streak in the thinking of massachusetts voters
4256737 lo que necesitamos es instalar los equipos y lo que necesitamos es tener gente que se asegure de que eso funciona y lo que necesitamos es que los rbitros entiendan el protocolo lo que necesitamos es estar seguros de que todo el mundo que participe lo entienda
4256738 quiero asegurarme de que cuando lo hagamos si lo hacemos sea perfecto

4256740 growth in emerging markets will continue to help offset losses in north america and new products will be cheaper to build
4256741 some plaintiffs allege that as a result of this ban they were forced to plant alternate lower yield seed varieties thereby reducing the size of their harvests
4256742 other plaintiffs allege that they were unable to obtain any rice seed because of the ban and had to plant different crops altogether
4256743 we believe we have acted responsibly and have complied with all relevant regulations and guidelines in our biotech rice development activities
4256744 i think a lot of farmers were waiting to see if a class was would be certified
4256745 i think now that judge perry has declined to certify that case then there may well be an influx of a lot more lawsuits
4256746 it is unclear what kind of animal it was but current evidence indicates it was not a large carnivore
4256747 when compared to a laptop netbook or umpc redfly offers a 90 percent tco savings while providing most of the same functionality and increased productivity for the mobile workforce our customers find it easier and much more productive using redfly to access remote desktops servers applications and virtualized environments compared to using a smartphone alone
4256748 the show is a different maid in a different manhattan
4256749 mr wood undeniably shares responsibility for what happened to mr keeran and should be held accountable for his reckless acts but no man ever deserves to die for another mans acts
4256750 this guy his mental capacities are not sufficient to make him a mastermind
4256751 for predictably offering testimony in capital cases that a defendant would pose a danger to society one of the questions a jury must decide in order to impose a death sentence
4256752 you have an individual that is a user or manipulator of other people and im thinking particularly in terms of where youre planning the robbery for two weeks
4256753 surely you would have thought in terms of using a mask or a disguise where you wouldnt have to kill somebody so this was a deliberate and intentional act in terms of the clerk that was going to be killed
4256754 when the law punishes by death it risks its own sudden descent into brutality transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint
4256755 that risk will have come to fruition and we all will have taken a descent into brutality unworthy of the state of texas
4256756 is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar maar zal beschikbaar zijn of is momenteel nog niet beschikbaar
4256757 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people this is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
4256758 death of a church occurs when unbelievers are allowed to take over ministries in the church it happens when a church becomes more concerned with form and liturgy than it is with life on a spiritual level death occurs when a church becomes more concerned about welfare and social ills than it is about salvation it happens when a church loves systems more than it loves jesus christ and it happens when a church becomes more concerned with material things than spiritual reality thats how a church dies it all is a result of sin sin in any form that the church tolerates whether it is in the members or the leaders tolerance of sin begins the cycle then comes the tolerance of unbelievers in the church until no one cares who is a believer or an unbeliever the end comes when the man who runs the church isnt a believer sins of commission and omission kill a church little by little when that happens christians become carnal soon afterwards unbelievers come into the church and then a total tolerance for sin exists the church begins to die and the people who really love jesus christ leave only to be replaced by people who dont know him
4256759 but the way crime is i tell you a nosey neighbor in a neighborhood is a real asset
4256760 it really doesnt take a whole lot and it really does amazingly free up a lot of space and you still have the same good look of the landscaping
4256761 maybe im not a victim but i might be able to look out and see something happening across the street and i can help identify a suspect in a case
4256762 if youre going to put bushes to cover your windows put rose buses thorny bushes
4256763 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4256764 ni en sue o se permitir a m dicos mover un paso hacia el congreso el 16 de agosto
4256765 i was actually here at eight oclock in the morning because i wanted to start the line because i figured if i get in through the door first i can make a better impression
4256766 i hadnt realized how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick
4256767 its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
4256768 i will admit it was quite bizarre to direct my wife in how to make love but its difficult whether youre married to a person or not
4256769 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
4256770 wells does not have a water extraction ordinance of any kind
4256771 were asking people to come out and show their support the reason were going for a moratorium is because the well heads poland spring owner nestle and kkwwd were discussing are in wells
4256772 the dep is required to approve any water extraction of that kind
4256773 christian bale attended a london police station on a voluntary basis in order to assist with an allegation that has been made against him to the police by his mother and sister
4256774 mr bale who denies the allegation co operated throughout gave his account in full of the events in question and has left the station without any charge being made against him by the police
4256775 weve only had one so 185 square feet per student thats fairly large
4256776 were looking at programs were looking at where we can make cuts and still meet needs of teachers
4256777 were trying to be responsible its a balancing act we need to be careful we dont want to be the district that builds a school then has to put on an addition in five years
4256778 so if we think it makes sense and the extra space is justified it might be approved
4256779 being invested in companies that are benefiting from a geopolitical situation involving genocide is no sound investment strategy
4256780 the stay is important because it keeps me on the ballot
4256781 even if the maine court acts and grants the stay the likelihood is that we cannot depend on them to maintain the stay until the ballots are printed were protecting ourselves by going to the u s supreme court i expect the request will be oiled by close of business on aug 15
4256782 you know if there was nothing else doing it could happen in the next few weeks but unfortunately or fortunately there are other things doing in the state legislature
4256783 wir reisen voll motiviert und gut vorbereitet an die mosel und k nnen in unserem swift super 1600 wieder voll angreifen nat rlich ist diese rallye auch eine gro e herausforderung aber die voraussetzungen mit der unterst tzung unserer vielen fans weitere wm punkte zu erk mpfen sind bestens
4256784 since nearly 80 of subjects with tsh levels between 3 0 and 5 0 miu l do not have antithyroid antibodies it is likely that the large majority of people with tsh in that range have little risk for the development of hypothyroidism
4256785 theres a lot of stuff regarding him and kates relationship theres a lot of stuff regarding his view on the no shows his view on drugs his view on the arrests and persecution relationships with band members
4256786 but the good thing about it is its not a peter book its a book from our perspective as well about how it affects us
4256787 the rental housing inspection program is a pro active program that will support the citys commitment to maintaining property values for sacramento residences including existing rental properties and to provide safe and affordable housing for tenants
4256788 specifically the decoder commander software did not include 1 the authors names 2 jmri copyright notices 3 references to the copying file 4 an identification of sourceforge or jmri as the original source of the definition files and 5 a description of how the files or computer code had been changed from the computer file names of decoderpro files without providing a reference to the original jmri files or information on where to get the standard version
4256789 the medfly is a pest that poses a serious threat to california agriculture
4256790 i would like to thank the residents and growers who helped us eradicate these infestations by cooperating with the three quarantines
4256791 what is really significant is that we were able to stabilize the hospital without going back to the voters for a tax increase
4256792 hay mucho temor y desilusi n entre los georgianos porque piensan que de un momento a otro pueden comenzar nuevamente los bombardeos
4256793 desde el mi rcoles por la noche luego de las intervenciones diplom ticas y el anuncio televisivo de que las tropas rusas dejaban giorgia la situaci n parece haber retornado a la normalidad aunque llegar a la ciudad de gori es imposible pens en enviar un p rroco para verificar los da os ocurridos en la poblaci n y ver el estado de salud de las familias pero la polic a georgiana ha impedido el acceso por razones de seguridad
4256794 caritas georgia ha iniciado la ayuda a las familias en dificultades afortunadamente ten a bienes de primera necesidad y alimentos que ya comenz a distribuir en los distintos campamentos en donde son acogidos quienes han perdido sus hogares

4256796 mostrarle a los muchachos el valor de la paz y la fraternidad
4256797 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4256798 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
4256799 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
4256800 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
4256801 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else
4256802 being one of millions with a close connection to cancer i know i need to do my part

4256809 many of us are concerned about the quality of care extended to those who receive elective surgery
4256810 ive always had a problem with people telling me oh you
4256811 so when everyone was telling me that i had to release my single on itunes because they own the market and thats just what youve gotta do these days i decided that i wasnt going to do it my whole career ive done that whenever everyones headed in the same direction i turn around and run the other way
4256812 this whole thing wasnt some attempt to change the way the industry works or some sh like that it was basically me knowing i had a good song one that people would love when they heard it
4256813 i mean people say itunes is popular because its convenient but so is mcdonalds that dont mean people arent still making reservations to go eat at fancy restaurants too
4256814 i knew the track was solid its got two of the best songs of all time mashed up together lynyrd skynyrds sweet home alabama and warren zevons werewolves of london its got great melodies so really my work was done
4256815 i knew people would hear it and know i wrote it theyd know it was real and thered be that connection and thats whats missing in music today i think people dont believe half the sh they hear some rapper or some pop girl singing about but with me they do and thats why people have reacted the way they have to the song
4256816 i think today everyones worried about looking cool about over thinking everything about all this bullsh
4256817 i just think thats a waste of time and i think a lot of other people do too i just want to have fun enjoy life and have a good time and i think theres a lot of people out there who are just like me

4256831 we are walking down the street holding hands theres a playground at the end of the block and i run to the swings and climb on and henry takes the one next to me facing the opposite direction and we swing higher and higher passing each other sometimes in sync and sometimes streaming past each other so fast it seems like were going to collide and we laugh and laugh and nothing can ever be sad no one can be lost or dead or far away right now we are here and nothing can mar our perfection or steal the joy of this perfect moment

4256834 it didnt matter in the end how old they had been or that they were girls but only that we had loved them and that they hadnt heard us calling still do not hear us up here in the tree house with our thinning hair and soft bellies calling them out of those rooms where they went to be alone for all time alone in suicide which is deeper than death and where we will never find the pieces to put them back together

4256851 our members are still seeing increased pressure on profits from rising costs without the ability to raise prices
4256852 there were some hopeful signs in last quarter s survey suggesting that the economy might be bottoming out but weakness persists across the board the fact that firms continue to reduce planned growth in capital investment staff development and employment is particularly troubling since it suggests that slowdown could have longer term implications
4256853 as i met people at our controller s workshop in las vegas in july i asked many of them this simple question how s your business
4256854 maybe things are not as bad as we might be lead to believe and the tough times are limited to certain industries at this time
4256855 our results show continued growth for our year over year periods we expect to see continued growth and acceptance of our water based chemical products through expanded sales and marketing activities along with efforts to initiate the marketing of our personal care products
4256856 we continue to provide leadership in the integration space between documentum and sharepoint we currently are 3 to 5 years ahead of the closest competitor
4256857 our clients and partners are creating exciting solutions with our docway product from pharmaceutical clinical portals documentum dcm integration and the industry leading csc firstdoc spx our customers are not turning off documentum but leveraging their investment through a robust sharepoint interface
4256858 we all know the most important thing is to have someone who knows the issues of the agency but also someone who is a good manager
4256859 this allows the most latitude in finding the best manager to run as we see every day a very very important department while still maintaining a level of technical expertise
4256860 there are some who have insisted that any department can be run with good management skills and that those skills are more important than mere credentials however this is not about tradition this is all about professionalism and the fact that the person heading the buildings department must be able to make the tough decisions as the final authority on matters of zoning site safety and building construction having a deputy who is a licensed professional is simply not the same thing
4256861 having an architectural or engineering license demonstrates that the commissioner knows how buildings are built and reassures those walking past construction sites that an important knowledge base is there at the highest level of authority with the department
4256862 i dont think there is any attempt by this legislation to scapegoat architects or engineers or any professionals
4256863 we dont think architects and engineers are bad managers we just think there are other places to also look for good managers
4256864 the financial results are essentially consistent with our expectations the residual impacts to our current performance from the issues prior to 2007 are being overcome each day as the company builds momentum from the turnaround plan the new management team put in place last year although the economic and competitive pressures remain difficult and we have been temporarily hampered by the impacts of the financial restructuring our initiatives are advancing positively including improvements in operational efficiency quality management processes customer service and sales management we continue to see progress winning back customers as well as with new customer wins
4256865 as we continue with the capital structure improvement phase of our turnaround we are comfortable with the strong foundation that has been established over the past year however we are continuing to identify opportunities for additional cost reductions and growth

4256883 w re er mir wahrscheinlich noch eine weile unbekannt geblieben
4256884 as the latter half of 2008 unfolds we believe that many of the initiatives identified and in some cases achieved during the first six months of the year will have a significant positive impact on our financial results going forward we were successful in finding alternative cost structures for the set top box product and this should accelerate the improvement not only to the company s top line going forward but to the bottom line and to cash flows as well
4256885 the commitment we made during the second quarter of this year slowed down the production and therefore the revenue growth that i expected to realize during the quarter and as a result the company will not reach some of the revenue targets that i anticipated we would reach during 2008 however i feel the changes provide the company with a much more realistic opportunity to achieve profitable near term growth earlier than expected

4256915 we understand that that residence was in the same condition maybe worse if thats possible than this one
4256916 i have always had a dread of becoming a passenger in life
4256917 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4256918 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4256919 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4256920 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4256921 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4256922 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4256923 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4256924 it is something that i am going to have to get used to basically getting my feet into the shape where they can tolerate it
4256925 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it
4256926 they are sore i think i will be all right
4256927 thats one of the main reasons i am doing it
4256928 i am getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick and i am trying to get a sense of how i feel
4256929 im not worried about being in shape or catching the football thats just what i do its more about me being healthy

4256931 the more i rest and the more i take care of my ankle and the more i take care of myself ill be closer to 100 percent if im not ill be 95 or 96 which i will definitely take

4256935 he was a member of our department for close to 15 years
4256936 he was a very active member here he was a great guy and always wanted to be a firefighter he went through all his fire schooling and became a fire inspector

4256948 creo que el entrenador va a elegir a lo mejor para m xico para este partido por el poco tiempo que ha tenido para trabajar con los jugadores que ah est n va a tratar de hacer lo mejor para que haya un equipo con mucha din mica que es lo que l quiere y que sea un equipo que se entregue en la cancha

4256959 sort of its summer break so my friends and i spend a lot of time playing games cause we dont have much else to do were trying to take it easy before we go off to college twister is my favorite game cause it gives me an excuse to get in crazy positions and stick my ass out in the air it always leads to me having dirty thoughts
4256960 well i imagine that everyone playing is naked both the boys and the girls our legs are spread open and were all tangled over each other eventually we start groping each other and then kissing and licking and even fucking right there on the mat
4256961 block f matters to the eastman school of music and eastman theater enormously
4256962 you are likely to see because this is a university making the bid is some combination of academic or performance space with retail and with housing
4256963 until we see all of the proposals it will be hard to evaluate everything but the u of r and the eastman school of music are such incredibly strong players not only in the regional economy but whats happening in the whole east side of downtown
4256964 i think most significantly well perform the kind of role berkeley and stanford perform in the bay area as the catalyst for further economic growth particularly with knowledge based spin off companies

4256974 what exactly do we mean by self publishing and self publishing companies
4256975 how is a self publishing company such as you analyze in your book different from a vanity publisher or is there not always a difference

4257013 a sense of solidarity has developed among louisvilles arts community
4257014 people here have something to prove and there is a real interest in making louisville a great place for artists to be
4257015 they show a lot of support for and interest in regional artists not just internationally renowned names

4257022 the decisions of the board are always made in a measured fashion weighing evidence with the intent and objectives of the gaming act
4257023 in addition to the obvious economic benefits of assuring that this project is completed this vote punctuates the integrity of both our process and of our role of overseeing legalized gaming in the commonwealth
4257024 the completion and operation of the pittsburgh casino is a critical element of the promises made by the legislature when it enacted the gaming act
4257025 while balancing our overarching objective to protect the public through regulation and policing of legalized slots gaming our purpose is also to properly and legally oversee this new industry and provide a significant source of new revenue and jobs
4257026 gold star registry makes it possible to obtain the tools that will help students learn while also making it easy for parents and communities to provide meaningful support to their local teachers
4257027 while donations from parents or the parent teacher association are always appreciated the items they give may not always align with our most pressing learning need
4257028 in many districts school budgets simply cannot cover the cost of all the classroom supplies needed teachers committed to creating an attractive learning environment and providing the additional tools to help their students learn are buying the extras with their own money our registry enables teachers to get what they need without putting further strain on their own budget or that of the district it effectively widens the circle of support for schools

4257039 nashville fan sent thursday august 14 2008 5 14 pm
4257040 we are extremely proud of our second quarter and first half 2008 results our margins continue to improve as the cost of our largest raw material milk continues to decrease from its record highs set in the fall of 2007 the price of milk in august was the second lowest month in 2008 and we hope the downward trend will persist throughout the remainder of 2008 even though we have had some relief in the cost of milk the prices of most of our other production and packaging supplies that are derived from oil continue to rise as does the cost to deliver our products
4257041 we intend on using the extra savings derived from these lower raw material prices to increase our marketing and promotional activities and to continue to educate the public as to the benefits of our kefir selling related expenses in the second quarter 2008 increased 26 compared to the same period a year ago and we expect to continue to spend a higher percentage of sales on marketing in the second half of 2008

4257045 we are very pleased with the over fifteen times increase in net income due in large part to the significant increase in revenues from natural gas royalties
4257046 a nearly fifteen fold increase in the companys earnings is remarkable but it is indicative of the companys ongoing and expanding asset acquisition program we look for more of this in the future
4257047 i think the issue is that you know in many ways mitt romney has had very definite swings of position not just on one or two things but on many of the issues
4257048 i think there are better choices for sen mccain that have the approval of value voters
4257049 we are very pleased with the results of operations for the second quarter of this year we have generated a significant increase in operating margins from both the onshore and offshore divisions that we believe will continue throughout the year the recently renegotiated sales and purchase contracts related to the waxahachie system have increased our gross margins by approximately 30 for that segment of operations
4257050 we will continue to pursue growth opportunities through additional acquisitions and are optimistic about the prospects to expand our operational footprint in 2008 until then we will remain focused on maximizing the income and efficiencies of our current assets
4257051 the results are lower than the company anticipated as the completion of our licensees product development processes has taken longer than envisioned while this delay is disappointing in the short term we are very encouraged that intense consumer focus groups have provided more solid data for our licensees which should benefit the company and our licensees when the licensees ultimately launch their products containing our technology we would rather be a partner in a well planned and executed product introduction than a timelier but less effective consumer launch fortunately additional licensing agreements especially the contract signed with the international chemical and consumer giant schwarzkopf and henkel is providing higher than expected earnings for us in the current year which has somewhat offset the delay in product launches by earlier licensees
4257052 kgi has routinely been approached by phd level science students interested in acquiring the management skills that they will need to be successful in industry
4257053 we are excited by city of hopes partnership in beginning this new program which will benefit young scientists and researchers at city of hope and address a significant workforce issue faced by companies throughout the life sciences industry

4257057 makah people have always lived in this area and over the past 150 years a lot of our important cultural items have been improperly removed from here and are located in museums throughout the country
4257058 nagpra gave hope to all indian people that we could legally seek return of our cultural objects and for many this promise has been realized if we had the resources we would make a bigger push to bring our objects home where they belong
4257059 go ahead and step down from my campaign so people dont think were connected but after you make the announcement lets grab a couple of beers and figure out how we can keep you in the loop but out of the publics eye

4257071 we achieved significant growth in revenue in the second quarter of 2008 due to increased productivity from our parent breeders
4257072 whats more despite higher expenses due primarily to the growing cost of feed we were able to maintain relatively stable margins and record an increase in net income due to more efficient operating practices the poultry industry in china is experiencing significant expansion due to strong demand and favorable market conditions to take full advantage of this we are in the midst of enlarging our mature breeder stock and continuing to expand our facilities
4257073 yuhe achieved solid revenue growth in the second quarter of 2008 and we expect to continue growing revenue from our day old broiler sales to 28 4 million in 2008 to meet strong industry demand we have completed the construction of two new parent breeder farms with an additional two farms on track to be completed by the end of 2008 in total we plan to increase our breeder population by 0 5 million birds
4257074 given our current growth trajectory we are confident that we will be able to emerge as the largest producer of day old broilers in china

4257088 aai can develop these two airports as models and compete with private sector in developing world class projects they can even compete in international arena both the projects involve large investment and will be completed within three years
4257089 it is an inescapable conclusion that there are two police stations lalbazar police headquarters is for the influential ones and local police stations are for the aam aadmi it is disgraceful that people have to knock on the high courts door for lodging an fir

4257094 ive been thinking about our discussion in the garden last night
4257095 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4257096 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4257097 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4257098 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4257099 you probably wouldnt eat one if it was offered to you right now
4257100 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4257101 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4257102 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4257103 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4257104 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4257105 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4257106 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4257107 of course you are going to argue this all day you bought 3 of them lol and that last one will end up being a physic gpu because we all know that the scaling of the third card in there is about 15 improvement over 2 cards
4257108 the first guy that showed up took a look at it and said oh i cant fix this and he just left

4257113 diese medaille bedeutet mir nichts ich wollte hier gold holen
4257114 ich denke meine niederlage im halbfinale war total ungerecht die strittigen regeln zeigen dass die fila nicht fair handelt
4257115 the persecution of sison through the use of the judicial process exposes the rottenness and corruption of the dutch justice and political system
4257116 the dutch cant determine the facts they can only rely on what the arroyo government tells them and what it wants is persecution for sison the demonization of sison will destroy us if we permit it to continue
4257117 given the history of the arroyo governments practice of manufacturing evidence against its political foes
4257118 are using judicial proceedings to put political pressure on the ndfp to surrender to the manila government
4257119 misused by units of the security forces against civilians who are members of political opposition parties and human rights groups
4257120 the military is either partisan for the elite or partisan for the people
4257121 the problem in basilan or sulu cannot be isolated from the overall problem of the bangsamoro people i have doubt on the effectiveness of the government strategy because it does not address the grievances and aspirations of the people the best way to fight terrorism is to address peoples grievances and to open democratic avenues where people can pursue peacefully their political aspirations self determination for muslims will open the windows of opportunity to resolve the long drawn conflict peacefully
4257122 it is clear that the arroyo regime really has no intention of talking peace it is only interested in waging all out war this is not just about joma now this is an attack on the filipino people and their aspirations for a just and lasting peace
4257123 the arroyo regime is blinded by its denial of that great lesson of history that revolutions bred by social injustice and oppression cannot be defeated much less be eradicated by the states iron hand and that brutal suppression of revolutionary leaders only constitute temporary setbacks many more invariably stand up to take their place in the frontlines of the struggle the netherlands government thinks that by colluding with the philippine and u s governments to politically persecute mr sison and the ndfp and to scuttle the grp government of the republic of the philippines ndfp peace negotiations it has done away with a big thorn in its throat a political embarrassment as well as a pesky obstacle to dutch multinational corporations unbridled profit making in the country the dutch has clearly interfered in the matter of the sovereign right of the filipino people the right to determine its political affairs including the political settlement of internal armed conflicts its shameful role in this outrageous episode shall in due time be thoroughly exposed and it shall consequently be held accountable
4257124 wir haben bereits die beantragten kosten um drei milliarden euro gek rzt das senkt den strompreis pro haushalt im schnitt um 48 euro im jahr das urteil des bgh schafft rechtssicherheit und erleichtert den wettbewerb im schnitt hat jeder stromkunde die auswahl zwischen 20 anbietern

4257132 it took me another five years before i was able to put my grand dream on paper in a literate form

4257147 bumms klatsch und schon lag ich auf dem boden der finger tut zwar weh hat aber damit nichts zu tun das war einfach wieder ein fehler zuviel
4257148 endlich habe ich richtig farbe bekommen im sommer sieht man einfach am besten aus
4257149 es wurde ein ermittlungsverfahren wegen des versto es gegen weisungen der f hrungsaufsicht eingeleitet
4257150 das f hr dazu dass sich die verbindungen zwischen den nervenzellen verst rken
4257151 ohne ribery und toni das ist ein vorteil wenn die beiden noch dabei w ren dann w re es sicher noch schwerer deshalb haben wir eine sehr gute chance
4257152 jarolim de jong oder olic haben noch reserven au erdem haben wir beim emirates cup ohne van der vaart sehr gut gespielt
4257153 es wird so genommen wie es ist wir machen das beste daraus
4257154 dieses pferd l sst einen wirklich gut aussehen hier sind schwierige klimatische bedingungen dazu kommt dass ein pferd immer unberechenbar sein kann aber satchmo ist in fantastischer verfassung ich bin super super stolz
4257155 ich war 2004 in athen nicht dabei deswegen sind diese spiele etwas ganz besonderes f r mich es ist einfach ein unglaubliches gef hl
4257156 die akustik dort ist wirklich nicht gut und der saal ist nicht so sch n um ihn unbedingt erhalten zu m ssen wenn man sich im vergleich dazu die bayerische staatsoper anschaut oder die mail nder scala im saal sollte die b hne wichtiger sein
4257157 es darf auch mal einen gelungenen neuen saal geben daf r gibt es genug beispiele berlin sollte da nicht provinziell denken ich wei ich wag mich da sehr weit vor aber ich bin sehr entt uscht dass man jetzt wieder zur ck auf null geht berlin ist reif f r einen gro en wurf wie einstmals bei der philharmonie
4257158 we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4257159 we not only are doing the job that a trustee purportedly would do but were months ahead of the trustee and making significant progress
4257160 we needed to be more dynamic we needed a bit more personality on the field of play
4257161 i thought midtjylland were excellent a big strong team who understood the counter attack game very well
4257162 i let him know that somebody has been down that path that has a lot of support for him and if he takes care of himself that theres no reason that he shouldnt have a great career
4257163 hes dealt with it for a long time said it was manageable just like ive been trying to do the last four or five months
4257164 he went through this career with it and i dont see any reason why i cant
4257165 it was about the same part of my career i lost weight had the same symptoms jay went through although it was in the offseason and not during the season
4257166 i got with a doctor got on insulin got knowledgeable about the disease and was able to play for a long time with it
4257167 i told him its not a big deal if you take care of yourself
4257168 you have to go about your business of diabetes just like you do your football job if he can go out and handle that it should be no problem for him
4257169 once i hit the field i am not really thinking about it
4257170 i have a monitor that monitors my blood sugar every minute greek head athletic trainer steve antonopulos just walks by me and tells me where i am at if i am feeling ok then i feel ok i do have a pump but when it gets really hot out it gets a little sticky and i dont like messing with it
4257171 he just rag dolls him to the ground david heath was stunned just from that
4257172 i wasnt a star or anything but it was in intramurals and i at least kind of knew my way around the ring with gloves on
4257173 hes a fast learner for as much of a brute as he looks hes pretty smart in there and figures things out
4257174 i knew hed be good at it if he tried it
4257175 he had that great wrestling background and his work ethic was so strong i knew if he focused all of his energy into it he could be very good at it
4257176 ive always been a competitive guy and i had kind of gotten away from it
4257177 i smashed two guys in under a minute and i got the urge to get back to competing
4257178 it really opened my eyes because i was so raw and really didnt know much about what i was doing and here i was hanging right there with a guy like vladdy
4257179 he really could reach the top at 205 once he gets the experience hes like an infant as a fighter right now but when he gets the experience hes going to be so difficult because hes a bad matchup for so many of those top guys
4257180 this is mma and there really are no sure things but i really believe tim can have a great career because of his unbelievable power and his wrestling and the way he works at it when hes winning fight after fight in a couple of years dont be surprised there are a lot of guys out there who if they got the chance could shock a lot of people and tim is definitely one of them

4257199 horror films or scary films are hard for me to watch
4257200 i can handle one a year its like getting on a roller coaster i flinched a couple of times watching mirrors once really badly and it embarrassed me
4257201 the script hearkened back to the films i really loved like the original amityville horror and my fathers donald sutherland remake of invasion of the body snatchers the shining dont look now the changeling the exorcist
4257202 those were all films that were rooted in characters the shining was a family going on a holiday so a guy could write
4257203 i choose films or stories and then i find a character that i can fit in that carson is this guy who is really down on his luck and is at the lowest confidence level hes been at hes been suspended as a police officer and in order to keep his family together he has to take a job as a security guard all of those things could be a normal drama and its a quarter of the way into the film before that stuff starts to reveal itself
4257204 just as an exercise i tried to spend one day without seeing my own reflection

4257213 the 110th congress isnt over were starting our work and then were doing it in a period where the congress is in recess im calling everybody back weve got a huge amount of work to engage in
4257214 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4257215 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4257216 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4257217 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows

4257221 the player adrian mutu will have to pay the amount of 17 173 990 euros to chelsea football club
4257222 this is an important decision for football not only did the drc make us a very significant monetary award the decision also recognised the damaging effect incidents involving drugs has on football and the responsibilities we all have in this area
4257223 we never asked for a sum the only thing we ever said publicly was how much in our accounts mutu was worth when mutu left obviously he had a value in our account
4257224 that value was 13 million pounds 25 28 million but when we made our case to fifa we did not ask for a specific amount
4257225 high gas prices high food prices increasing unemployment its showing up at the front door
4257226 last year we helped 15 000 families with emergency financial aid
4257227 we do not want to continue to see this increase you are always going to have people who fall on hard times but there seems to be a consistent growing number of people who are not making it financially

4257231 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
4257232 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
4257233 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now

4257238 i hadnt realized how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick
4257239 its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
4257240 we knew that if we were going to do something again it had to be something big and emotional
4257241 revolutionary road is so painful and beautiful to read simply because of the brutality of the honesty that frank and april end up experiencing together
4257242 lekan has a broad knowledge of the rhythms that really are the basis for the music we play in america west african rhythms that have been there for centuries
4257243 its interesting to bring these two streams back together again the west african approach to rhythm together with how we are feeling about it as jazz musicians
4257244 it was fascinating to me to be marrying some very unusual rhythms with these standard songs
4257245 i have always placed more emphasis on rhythm than on melody and harmony because the tendency in western music is to downplay the importance of rhythm
4257246 if i did standards on every album that i did id run out of ideas its kind of a dead end situation
4257247 its great music yeah but you have to start to experiment find your own voice and its very difficult to do that if youre doing standards constantly one of the most important components of jazz is that it embraces tradition but at the same time it has to move forward
4257248 her own take on standards in a very contemporary manner
4257249 i think she brings the freshest take on standards of any artist ive heard
4257250 she has a very distinctive sound and style and very unusual arrangements to do an album like this and and reinvent herself without even trying is amazing her style is absolutely her own nothing borrowed about it
4257251 i think the real story here is what the musicians are doing
4257252 although i might be singing in a fairly conservative fashion at least for the first verse the musicians are doing some wild stuff from the get go
4257253 i love to get the musicians out of a certain comfort thing that they have to get them out of new york city and into a place thats just totally different
4257254 jackson is the biggest city in mississippi but youre not that far removed from a very strong sense of rural mississippi
4257255 it is so much more relaxed sometimes the tape is rolling and they dont even realize it so you are able to capture those moments that are unguarded
4257256 i hope to be a conduit to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between west african culture particularly the yoruba and how much that has impacted who we are in the south particularly in mississippi and louisiana
4257257 i think theres so much we have to learn about our culture and who we were before we came here i think that empowers you and gives you a solid sense of identity one thing we need in order to strengthen ourselves and our community is to begin to draw those connections and to celebrate that

4257267 secondhand smoke is the number one cause of preventable health disease in america
4257268 research has shown that inhaling secondhand smoke is more harmful than actually smoking primarily due to the unfiltered nature of the smoke and its having been cooled by the air
4257269 smoking and secondhand smoke has a significant cost impact on our current health care system
4257270 which is not a right or protected by the constitution
4257271 but secondhand smoke harms an involuntary population which has a constitutional right to clean air and a clean environment
4257272 my motion to ban smoking is not an outright ban
4257273 but seeks legislation that regulates its usage to specific places that do not have an expectation of involuntary contact with people
4257274 all of us have experienced walking through smoke when entering a building and walking in the smoking debris which clutters our environment enough is enough it is time to put a stop to this now
4257275 over the past couple of years i have at every opportunity confronted several hundred smokers about their health concerns and requested that they put their cigarette out and save their own lives

4257279 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
4257280 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
4257281 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
4257282 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
4257283 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
4257284 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
4257285 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
4257286 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
4257287 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
4257288 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
4257289 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
4257290 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
4257291 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
4257292 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
4257293 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
4257294 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
4257295 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
4257296 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
4257297 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
4257298 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
4257299 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
4257300 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
4257301 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
4257302 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
4257303 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
4257304 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
4257305 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
4257306 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
4257307 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
4257308 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
4257309 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

4257315 this is what i would put in the context of yet another flat battery or flat tyre he said

4257319 it remains the case that a level headed policy is the one that most helps people in the region
4257320 we must criticize what needs to be criticized and we have done this in the past including with clear words when necessary towards russia with regard to russian bombing of georgia and the presence of russian troops in georgia proper
4257321 we should also pursue a policy which is sensible and realistic
4257322 if the eu really wants to play a stronger role in the region if the eu wants to help in the stabilization of a crisis hit region then the lines of communication must be kept open to tbilisi and moscow
4257323 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4257324 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4257325 the first is that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia are not called into question in future talks the other is that it is totally unacceptable to question the legitimacy of the democratically elected georgian government
4257326 merkel will try to convince medvedev to move toward a ceasefire accept a monitoring mission of the osce and hopefully also be open to a stabilizing international peace force in the region
4257327 i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russias future behavior
4257328 our board of trustees understands the economic challenges people face and concluded that offering a free admission option for children would stimulate additional attendance and might enable a broader audience to experience the treasures currently housed at the museum it serves as a gift to the community not unlike the u s navy band sea chanters concert and the community day and ice cream social events which the museum delivered free to the community in the spring

4257335 there is clearly enough activity for us to be very busy in addressing potential threats

4257491 the great red zone that voted for bush is clearly ready for war the decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead and may well mount a fifth column
4257492 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4257493 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent hes just been getting on with things professionally in training
4257494 if you ask any manager they always want their best players available dimitar is no different
4257495 he is a great player and is carrying himself superbly well through this and we want him to stay but if it is my personal opinion i have no preference one way or another you have to go with what is happening
4257496 hes our player he is at our club and he is a fantastic player it would be great for him to stay
4257497 it is nothing to panic about we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4257498 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4257499 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4257500 there are a couple of offers on the table and the prospect of moving to france would be an exciting option
4257501 im genuinely not sure what clubs are after me at this stage ive been more concerned with the olympic games and trying my best to help us progress
4257502 but now were out id like to get my club future settled as soon as possible its no secret that im very keen to move overseas and i owe it to myself and my family to sort my future out as quickly as i can
4257503 i think the french league would suit me its a very under rated competition and its full of excellent players
4257504 a few of the ivory coast boys are based there and its one of the top leagues in europe
4257505 we felt the jets showed us a lack of respect in their dealings with us
4257506 it was irresponsible and as a result we are no longer interested in the player we have no intention of being draw into a bidding contest for jade north
4257507 the problem for us was that we lacked patience in the final third of the field and wasted the many chances
4257508 the teams we faced were able to keep the ball in our half but we just didnt do that enough ourselves going forward and it cost us
4257509 it was a learning experience and i think we did well without quite imposing ourselves on teams as much as we wanted
4257510 there is only so much a coach can do its the players who kick the balls and arnie doesnt deserve to be hammered for what happened we all learned a lot under him and blaming him for how things turned out is the easy option
4257511 we looked at the linux linpus version for this review which has an 8gb ssd and 512mb of ddr2 ram accompanying its 1
4257512 nicholas negroponte had a vision to build a 100 laptop and give away millions to educate the worlds poorest children and amd vs intel the challengers new plan
4257513 just enjoy the moment and he might surprise himself and everybody else as to how close he is to being a regular a league player
4257514 thats what happened to me when i made my professional debut i trained so hard and lived so long dreaming about it that when the chance came i didnt feel like it was a bridge too far it felt like i belonged
4257515 im really proud of chris because he was so close to signing forms in england twice
4257516 he did extremely well especially at blackburn but rather than be disappointed when he got home he went the other way and tried to get faster and stronger and better
4257517 he gave the right response to his initial disappointment and look at him now he has been given a chance and im sure he will take it because he is a very composed kid
4257518 it is a real eye opener even at 17 and 18 years old to see how strong and fast and skilful some of the other players are
4257519 in australia we are so far away from it and just see the glamour of the premier league on tv but all the hard work gets done on the training ground
4257520 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4257521 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4257522 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4257523 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4257524 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4257525 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4257526 we have to believe that we could get a result we had to match the effort and tonight it was enough
4257527 i think at the start of the match they didnt expect us to come out and take it to them with the energy and effort that we showed
4257528 will something be done ahead of the second leg certainly yes but before saturday no
4257529 if you look at the number of players we had out you can say it was very positive for us
4257530 we did not have abou diaby cesc fabregas tomas rosicky samir nasri kolo toure eduardo da silva and philippe senderos while alex song is at the olympics
4257531 we missed seven or eight players out so for me our squad looks big because the players who were here did well
4257532 it isnt that type of occasion i keep saying that i want us to be recognised for the achievements weve had and we deserve to be in the premier league
4257533 im not into the theory of us just going an enjoying the day
4257534 the team know they have to improve and i did not have to say much to them in the dressing room sometimes you do not need many words
4257535 the only positive to take from the match was the fact that we did not concede a goal
4257536 why cant we listen to a lot of different colors
4257537 i wanted to look at music in its totality i tried to approach the album with the same sense of connectedness that is in all music people feel differently on different days so i wanted every song to be a color in a box of crayons and then the album would be complete
4257538 i feel like we need to represent that approach to music more and stop trying to force artists to be what the record companies feel like they want them to be and allow them to explore music period
4257539 in todays market where you have the internet and its such a big part of your life and you have itunes and a lot of people want songs that represent a lot of different points of view they pick what they like they dont buy the album anymore so i wanted a real variety there
4257540 i had to make a judgment about i feel love because it wasnt working so we all decided to just make it like a chant
4257541 there wasnt really anything like it out there so to tell you the truth we decided to make it the b side of the single we were really that apprehensive about that how it would be received
4257542 but the djs flipped the record over and played it instead they really fell in love with that song and now its chronicled as a big deal thats a nice feeling
4257543 when the kids grow up the only thing youre doing is sitting on the couch eating potato chips and thinking where do i go from here
4257544 im looking at my thighs growing and thought its time to get off the couch and get a j
4257545 i felt if i ever recorded again it would not be under the thumb of a record company
4257546 i wanted to be free to be a diverse person ive lived all over the world ive traveled extensively and i have a lot of input from different places that ive never really been able to synergize and bring it out in the music
4257547 i try to tap into everyones real emotions to get to place where they give me what i need to write and vice versa
4257548 i tend to write as a viewer not write personal stuff someone like joni mitchell i adore but i dont know if i could be that honest
4257549 i found it really interesting collaborating with this group of people
4257550 we could really get inside each others heads and share and get to some intimate places and they wouldnt buck you
4257551 its something ive never done really and i dont want to give it away
4257552 its almost like going to a musical were going to give the show a visual context thats really on the cutting edge i hope everyone will see it and go wow that coupled with all the people onstage and the dancers and it should be a good night out
4257553 i said this girl and my staff said tyra theres something a little different about this girl and then i said yes well when i first started modeling people said that about me too cause i was different i was like nothing the fashion industry had ever seen i mean i had this big forehead and just the fiercest walk of anyone out there but i was so young you know and i think it scared some people so everyone was like different different all the time about me and then ill never forget it one of the members of my staff placed the strawberry horizons jamba juice she had just run out to get on the table in front of me looked me in the eye and said no tyra shes different cause she used to be a man then it was like the clouds parted and god himself came down and whispered in my ear this is the hook for cycle 11 tyra and so here you are
4257554 i was sold to the prince of saudi arabia as a wife
4257555 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country
4257556 i had a gun in my carrying case which was given to me by a marvelous engraver
4257557 last year at the telethon of 07 he presented me with this gorgeous gift i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon
4257558 when low asked me if i had a gun i said i know what i packed jeff then it all flashed a whole year flashed in front of me

4257561 she will be taking a certain number of documents that will make it possible to consolidate the ceasefire
4257562 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr dmitry medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4257563 it was underlined that the document should finally be signed by the georgian side as was agreed in moscow the french minister assured that paris is working on this
4257564 the head of state and mrs rice both believed that the six point draft agreement approved by medvedev and saakashvili on august 12 should be signed by the parties without delay in order to consolidate the cessation of hostilities and accelerate the russian forces withdrawal
4257565 the united states of america stands strongly for the territorial integrity of georgia it is time for this crisis to end
4257566 the russian president has said that their military operations have halted we would hope that he is true to his word and that their operations will halt
4257567 its something that ive wanted for a long time so its time to get down to work now
4257568 ive had a bit of time to get comfortable to the surroundings
4257569 im excited to improve myself and try and get into the squad
4257570 if you look at the guys and their careers its the stuff that people like me dream about
4257571 i try and watch everything the more experienced boys do on and off the park so i can learn from them
4257572 it is not good for any country to ask for a change just before the match i hope this situation will not affect the relationship between iran and uzbekistan football associations
4257573 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4257574 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4257575 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4257576 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4257577 i have heard some threats that they will not accept us into the wto but no one has so far even tried to allow us to join it
4257578 you defended your land and justice was on your side
4257579 that is why you won with the assistance of russian peacekeepers i think that is an appropriate outcome
4257580 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4257581 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4257582 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise
4257583 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
4257584 it is something that i am going to have to get used to basically getting my feet into the shape where they can tolerate it
4257585 my feet are not in the same position they have been in for the first 30 years of my life so it is kind of putting them in a new position and they are not comfortable with it
4257586 they are sore i think i will be all right
4257587 thats one of the main reasons i am doing it
4257588 i am getting there slowly but surely but the season is coming around pretty quick and i am trying to get a sense of how i feel
4257589 im not worried about being in shape or catching the football thats just what i do its more about me being healthy
4257590 if i am not it will be pretty close ill be a lot further along than last year
4257591 the more i rest and the more i take care of my ankle and the more i take care of myself ill be closer to 100 percent if im not ill be 95 or 96 which i will definitely take
4257592 the goal is to defeat obama i dont want obama in office
4257593 we dont want to talk about his patriotism and character
4257594 we concede that hes a patriot and a person of good character
4257595 since to date no one has proven that anything corsi has said was dishonest

4257609 hes a great coach he knows what hes doing obviously hes been doing this for a ton of years
4257610 he said you have to go in softer you cant go in hard you cant go in to kill it
4257611 youve got to go in and use your momentum and square your shoulders up to the ball
4257612 he let me come out here when he doesnt even know me im very grateful for that
4257613 you can lead a horse or child to water but you cant make him drink or eat
4257614 circumcision has been proven in reducing the risk of heterosexual men becoming infected from an hiv positive woman from vaginal sex but our main finding is that circumcised or not gay men are just as likely to use condoms
4257615 gay men are concerned about sexual dysfunction premature ejaculation as well as old arguments that circumcision reduced masturbation or sexual desire
4257616 in our study we found gay men who were circumcised at infancy didnt report having some kind of negative or positive impact on sexual dysfunction
4257617 however nearly all men who were circumcised after infancy reported some sexual dysfunction erectile problems or premature ejaculation and one in five reported some complication as a result of the circumcision particularly they were twice as likely to be bottoms
4257618 if male circumcision does take place our study confirms that infant circumcision is much safer
4257619 theyre coming from a generation where circumcision is really down but also given the interesting findings from africa we need to know whether they are thinking about circumcision and whether they want to forgo condom use
4257620 the city and the community act collaboratively to bring to life the city of villages and deliver on goals set out in sustainable sydney 2030
4257621 the city is proud to support each and every one of these successful grants and we are particularly pleased to support so many worthwhile initiatives from our glbt community
4257622 these two grants will help us provide valuable opportunities for members of our community to increase the knowledge skills and networks that can help improve their health and welfare we thank the city of sydney for their support and look forward to working with them on these projects as well as the many other initiatives that form part of acons partnership with the city of sydney
4257623 we are thrilled to have been awarded this considerable opportunity to extend our community education work we wish to sincerely thank the city of sydney who have been a long time supporter of the glrl through subsidised rent and support for our 58 08 campaign
4257624 previously i was unaware that you could receive funding for more than one event at a time so were currently looking at maybe getting another grant to set up other things like perhaps a self defence class which would be great from my experience the council has been nothing but helpful and as a community organisation we really are appreciative of the help they provide
4257625 our goal is to preserve those traditions and present chinese culture to an english speaking audience if you can recognize and understand the roots of chinese culture i think we will gain a better understanding of who the chinese people are
4257626 i still cant get over it it was an amazing opportunity
4257627 we got to visit several different folk artists in the different cities and towns
4257628 they want to know what real china is like and this is sort of an opportunity to do that
4257629 i have all this accumulated knowledge and experience and no one wants to employ it and im not sure why

4257653 the records not finished its supposed to be me and rihannas duet
4257654 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have
4257655 so with rihanna that was an idea i had i just wanted to go totally left and kind of weird and thats what i threw at her
4257656 having the support of my fans on the second round was just incredible and its even getting bigger now
4257657 lekan has a broad knowledge of the rhythms that really are the basis for the music we play in america west african rhythms that have been there for centuries
4257658 its interesting to bring these two streams back together again the west african approach to rhythm together with how we are feeling about it as jazz musicians
4257659 it was fascinating to me to be marrying some very unusual rhythms with these standard songs
4257660 i have always placed more emphasis on rhythm than on melody and harmony because the tendency in western music is to downplay the importance of rhythm
4257661 if i did standards on every album that i did id run out of ideas its kind of a dead end situation
4257662 its great music yeah but you have to start to experiment find your own voice and its very difficult to do that if youre doing standards constantly one of the most important components of jazz is that it embraces tradition but at the same time it has to move forward
4257663 her own take on standards in a very contemporary manner
4257664 i think she brings the freshest take on standards of any artist ive heard
4257665 she has a very distinctive sound and style and very unusual arrangements to do an album like this and and reinvent herself without even trying is amazing her style is absolutely her own nothing borrowed about it
4257666 i think the real story here is what the musicians are doing
4257667 although i might be singing in a fairly conservative fashion at least for the first verse the musicians are doing some wild stuff from the get go
4257668 i love to get the musicians out of a certain comfort thing that they have to get them out of new york city and into a place thats just totally different
4257669 jackson is the biggest city in mississippi but youre not that far removed from a very strong sense of rural mississippi
4257670 it is so much more relaxed sometimes the tape is rolling and they dont even realize it so you are able to capture those moments that are unguarded
4257671 i hope to be a conduit to facilitate an understanding of the relationship between west african culture particularly the yoruba and how much that has impacted who we are in the south particularly in mississippi and louisiana
4257672 i think theres so much we have to learn about our culture and who we were before we came here i think that empowers you and gives you a solid sense of identity one thing we need in order to strengthen ourselves and our community is to begin to draw those connections and to celebrate that

4257689 of de gebruikte strategie van de voorbije 14 maanden zo goed is geweest daar valt
4257690 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4257691 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4257692 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4257693 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve

4257709 lets ask them will they invite you to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it in reality it is of major concern to russians
4257710 if it is inside the peacekeeping zone of responsibility then it is legitimate for intelligence information and special groups to be there
4257711 when the russians come across an abandoned georgian military installation they are not leaving them as is
4257712 we wont just support this solution but will guarantee it both in the caucasus and the world as a whole

4257719 to peek to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4257720 we have to note that there have been enormous steps forward in a number of areas
4257721 manifest failure of the chinese government to keep their promises
4257722 im not asking about how well the games are being run or how wonderful the games are
4257723 are you embarrassed by china i dont think anyone thinks you have answered the question
4257724 the olympic games is largely about the athletes and they have given us extremely strong feedback about how things are going
4257725 were not getting anywhere are we are the ioc embarrassed about the chinese governments record on human rights one more chance
4257726 we have to note the enormous steps in the wider area the world is watching and the ioc is appraising
4257727 people enjoy more freedom people are living a good life everyone is happy thats a fact
4257728 of course there are exceptions like in any other country but they need to take the legal process and procedures to resolve any issues we cannot allow this country to be in chaos
4257729 but there are a few people who have come here to peek to be critical to dig into the small details and find fault
4257730 this does not mean that we are not fulfilling our promises over human rights to the ioc the whole country can see how can china has developed how china has genuinely welcomed the world to enjoy everything with us
4257731 i did not promise that china would promise to do whatever with the games in china i did not say that
4257732 i think the games will open up the horizon about china people will see better what china is about

4257742 the problem is most difficult for obama with older women there are probably a couple of strikes there older people have more concerns about his lack of experience and older women were pretty strong backers of senator clinton
4257743 there is still some indication in pennsylvania that there are still some unhappy clinton voters there fourteen percent of the democrats in the state say they are voting for senator mccain we will have to watch and see where that goes if indeed those democrats come home i e vote democrat then senator obama is probably home free in pennsylvania
4257744 my names aft and this is fore star and port
4257745 pleased to meet you aft fore star and port my names ishmael what can i do for you
4257746 ah yes i have had some of your kind on board before you know many of us have trouble with masts and the ropes that handle the sails it can be very difficult to learn the ropes
4257747 mastless mariners are completely unsuited to handling masts you have surely seen how they have become entangled in the ropes and done great damage to themselves as well as to the sailboat
4257748 yes i have seen that some of them have gone overboard and plied the seas with other watercraft others have gone back to shore but there are some of us here who were like that at first and now you would never know the ropes are second nature to them now
4257749 i think there are very few of such who can truly be happy that way it is only a matter of time before most of them become entangled in the masts ropes and hurt themselves and many others on your sailboat
4257750 be that as it may what interests you mastless mariners in this sailboat
4257751 we are actually a subchapter of mastless mariners known as the mastless sailors society even though we do not like masts we very much like sailing we would like to do some mastless sailing
4257752 i would very much like to see you build and sail a mastless sailboat
4257753 you have misunderstood me we are not proposing to build a mastless sailboat you know there is only one and can only be one sailboat in this harbor we want you to let us come aboard but before you do so we insist that you cut down that mast
4257754 if i cut down that mast this would no longer be a sailboat sailboats must have masts in order to sail what else could we attach the sails to
4257755 you obviously do not know much about sailing or the history of sailing we know a lot about sailing at our institute for mastless sailing we have conducted many scientific and historical studies of sailing if you were more familiar with this literature you would realize what you say is nonsense and quite narrow minded i might even say superstitious for example if this sailboat only works with a mast what is this outboard motor doing in the back here or these oars up here if sailboats were restricted to using masts with sails then they would not have outboard motors or oars
4257756 when the wind isnt blowing or when it is blowing too hard that we cannot use the sails and in those cases we will use oars or our small outboard engine but we are sailors we prefer to travel with the wind furling the sails raised on our masts
4257757 perhaps you do not realize how hurtful what you are saying is to us mastless mariners it is also quite unfair and wrong there are many types of watercraft which travel very well without masts for instance look at that speedboat out there it can go much faster than you are going right now or look at this canoe it is is very maneuverable with those oars and if masts were so great then why is your sailboat looking so bad it is taking on water and the sails are tattered we do not think masts are necessary for boating removing it wont hurt anything
4257758 you sound just like those other sailors who made fun of us because we didnt like masts they called us lily livered landlubbers some of them did more than just call us names they beat us rejected us made us feel ashamed for not liking masts some even killed us but we are the same as you we yearn to be on the sea just as deeply as you our desires are just as valid as yours and we will not stand to be demeaned any longer
4257759 i know some sailors who have hurt some people as you say
4257760 they have brought great discredit upon sailors and boatsmen of all stripes i am truly sorry but we sailors would not be sailors if we didnt feel it was the best way to travel the seas but this harbor is wide and there is room on it for many types of seaworthy vessels
4257761 but in the past you sailors have tried to forbid any other type of maritime traffic to travel the seas
4257762 yes there are some sailors who feel that these other watercraft pose a danger to sailing there have been some collisions and as a sailor i think some of these watercraft are not well suited for traveling the ocean it is not within our power to stop these other types of vessels from being in the harbor anymore and there is room for many types of watercraft but i do confess as a sailor that i believe sailing is the best way to travel the seas
4257763 we too love sailboats the best of all watercraft that is why we want you to let us on the boat sailboats are very important to us this is the way we want to travel the seas
4257764 as i said mastless mariners are already allowed on board so long as they are willing to try to learn the ropes what is it you have against masts
4257765 we do not think it is necessary for sailing it is an arbitrary and narrow minded way to look at sailing in fact some of us suspect that you put the mast there just so you could keep mastless mariners from sailing
4257766 to tell you the truth just looking at the mast makes me sick
4257767 in fact the last time i tried to work the ropes i threw up
4257768 it is very difficult if not impossible for us to be on this sailboat as long as you keep that mast it hurts you and us if it stays
4257769 but what is it you like about sailboats if you dislike masts
4257770 i think the sails are very beautiful i admire the watertight hull and the keel is beautiful
4257771 i am indifferent to sails but i love the way a sailboats hull is watertight
4257772 i do not think sailboats need to be watertight i do not care about sails or keel but i love the figurehead on the prow
4257773 it sounds like you four do not even agree amongst yourselves about what a sailboat should be
4257774 and even many of the mastless mariners who are not interested in sailing believe that you must let us aboard and remove the mast from your sailboat
4257775 is for you to build a mastless sailboat and see how it works it is true i do not know much about sailing i come from generations of sailors and my ancestors built this sailboat i dont know how everything works i am just trying to keep it in good repair for those who follow me i would like to be very sure that a mast is unnecessary before i remove it i would like for you to perform your mastless sailing experiments on someone elses boat
4257776 you have no more right to this boat than we do
4257777 you do not own this sailboat you did not build it and pardon me for saying but if you mast loving sailors were so good at sailing then why is your sailboat taking on water and why are your sails so tattered
4257778 i do not claim to be a very good sailor
4257779 some of the holes in the keel i have caused i have tried to repair those as best i could others have damaged the hull and then jumped overboard deciding that sailing wasnt for them some have even torn the sails or neglected them in times past we required people who did that damage to stay on board until they could repair it that didnt always work so well either but now the coast guard says i have to let anyone off as soon as they want to leave the coast guard has laid down rules on who can and cannot sail on this vessel even though we have been sailing long before there was a coast guard they can affect many things but they cannot force us to keep sailing
4257780 i believe very much in the importance of keeping a sailboat watertight and the sails in good repair if you would just chop down that mast youd see that id be a very good member of the crew
4257781 but not all of your companions believe those things are important on a sailboat
4257782 if i chop down my mast its not only you who will come aboard it is all your companions who will come aboard as well the ones who have no problem with damaging hulls or sails ive already got enough of that thank you
4257783 but that can hardly keep a basis for keeping us off
4257784 you already let people on your sailboat who dont think sails or waterproof hulls are important the only difference is some of us are also mastless and that isnt fair
4257785 i ask this question of you aft how can you have sails without a mast
4257786 look at that tanker over there look how beautiful its sails are sails can be attached like that to a pole or many other ways i am sure that tanker is travelling very well without as mast
4257787 aft that is not a sail it is just a particularly beautiful set of flags like sails flags flap in the breeze but sails are used for propulsion on a sailboat flags have a different purpose
4257788 i do not agree ishmael i dont think you know very much throughout history boats have travelled the waters without masts and many of them have even travelled by the wind without either sails or masts
4257789 if a sailboat doesnt have a mast then it is not a sailboat anymore
4257790 it will be no different than a rowboat or a poorly designed motorboat
4257791 but the number of masts isnt fixed schooners have at least two masts sometimes many more i do not think the number of masts is important it could be 1 2 3 4 or zero masts and still be a sailboat
4257792 there are sailing vessels that have more than one mast i am not so good a sailor i could handle more than one it is even more complicated and difficult to learn the ropes those are very powerful and sometimes even dangerous vessels that are in a different class than our ordinary sailboat still there is a huge difference between three masts and none at all
4257793 i wasnt going to mention this but i see that i am going to have to
4257794 there is a gold coin doubloon nailed to your mast from the province of pequod i think masts are a way to secretly promote the ways of that province even though there are many provinces throughout this harbor our laws say you cannot favor one province at the expense of another
4257795 yes there is a pequod doubloon nailed there but have you noticed that there are many others nailed there too in fact i think every province has its doubloon nailed there each of them wants to put its stamp on the mast but we could remove all of those doubloons and there would still function as a mast
4257796 yes but it would still remind us of the province of pequod there are many provinces who now say that sailboats do not need masts even some of your fellow mast loving sailors who know masts and their ropes very well do not think masts are necessary for sailing they think they are only there to display the doubloons
4257797 you say i am not a very good or smart sailor
4257798 and you may be right but i wonder how much these people can know about sailing either i am sorry but i cannot let you on my boat there are other watercraft for those of you who do not like masts there are also many people ashore some of them who dont like masts and some of them who do but who arent ready to take to the seas yet furthermore while we have been having this argument i have not been able to do the work of repairing and strengthening this vessel
4257799 you have no authority to prevent me from getting on this ship and removing that mast i am going to call the coast guard over here and make them force you to take down that mast so that we can come aboard

4258003 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4258004 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4258005 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4258006 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4258007 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4258008 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4258009 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4258010 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4258011 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4258012 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4258013 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4258014 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4258015 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4258016 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4258017 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4258018 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4258019 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4258020 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4258021 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4258022 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4258023 hell if i worked half as hard for myself as i do for everyone else just think what i could do
4258024 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4258025 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4258026 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4258027 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4258028 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
4258029 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4258030 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4258031 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4258032 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4258033 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4258034 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4258035 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4258036 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4258037 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4258038 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4258039 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4258040 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4258041 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4258042 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4258043 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4258044 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4258047 but it does not resolve the dispute indeed we would hope everyone acknowledges that it is impermissible under the constitution for a court to order someone not to repeat publicly available truthful information
4258048 the restraining order even if modified remains an improper prior restraint restricting speech
4258049 the first amendment does not allow people to be silenced because their speech exposes flaws even if those flaws might someday be illegally misused by others to protect our clients rights we had no choice but to ask the court to reconsider the gag order
4258050 who did this we didnt do this we would never
4258051 we tried to find protections and good systems to make sure that people had to buy the product but in the pc world you have people that are angry if you dont let them pirate
4258052 a lot of stars would have to align but should those stars shine in our favor theres a fun daisies episode to be had with a guest character confessing to a murder because an inanimate object told her to do it
4258053 urgente necesidad de respetar y promover los derechos intr nsecos de los pueblos ind genas que derivan de sus estructuras pol ticas econ micas y sociales y de sus culturas de sus tradiciones espirituales de su historia y de su concepci n de la vida especialmente los derechos a sus tierras territorios y recursos

4258059 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4258060 but sometimes it is and even though you do i dont mind that
4258061 its a weird and scary thing and a comforting thing all at the same time i suppose
4258062 then focus on the comforting it will give you something to do on the floor tonight
4258063 sleeping on the floor you wont feel in charge anymore

4258070 ik heb vijftien jaar bij de gemeente roosendaal gewerkt daar was ik onder meer verantwoordelijk voor de organisatie van de kermissen in de gemeente op een gegeven moment werd ik gedetacheerd bij de gemeente helmond om ook daar de kermis te regelen zo is het balletje gaan rollen
4258071 de autoscooters bijvoorbeeld een draaimolen nogakraam en touwtrekspel dat zijn vaste waarden oosterhout heeft zelf karakteristieke attracties die hier niet kunnen ontbreken de hobbelende geit bijvoorbeeld de golvende draaimolen waarbij je kwastje kunt trekken voor een gratis ritje red dat hoort echt bij oosterhout
4258072 omdat oosterhout zich profileert als familiestad proberen we ook een echte familiekermis neer te zetten we willen graag veel attracties waar niet alleen de kinderen in kunnen maar waar gezinnen samen in kunnen stappen papa en mama moeten mee de attractie in kunnen dat is trouwens niet alleen leuker voor de ouders maar ook gunstig voor kermisexploitanten met een attractie waarbij meer gezinsleden mee kunnen doen verkoopt die ook meer kaartjes
4258073 ook spectaculaire attracties zijn belangrijk die heb je nodig voor de beeldvorming attracties die over kop gaan die alle kanten op draaien behalve de goede groot hoog spektakel springt er uit ook dat hoort bij de kermis
4258074 want wij leggen dan wel de basis voor de kermis de bezoekers moeten er een succes van maken
4258075 vaak probeer ik in de zomermaanden al attracties vast te leggen voor de kermissen van het jaar daarna
4258076 dan ga ik bijvoorbeeld in tilburg vast kijken naar bijzondere attracties voor de oosterhoutse kermis van het jaar erop er moeten elk jaar dingen zijn die er niet eerder waren
4258077 we leggen de inschrijvingen en de wensen van de gemeente daarna naast elkaar om een selectie te kunnen maken we proberen voor ieder wat wils weg te zetten
4258078 deze week zijn we puur bezig met de uitvoering op straat met witte hoekjes uitzetten wie precies waar moet komen te staan volgens de gemaakte tekeningen zorgen dat de stroomvoorziening in orde is de camping voor de exploitanten in orde maken verlichting plaatsen wegen afzetten borden plaatsen
4258079 dat varieert van wethouders die toestemming moeten geven voor bepaalde zaken tot mensen van de buitendienst communicatiemedewerkers en de mannen van de elektriciteit

4258101 the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4258102 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4258103 if on a bad day a guy gets that letter that says his tour has been extended from 12 to 15 months that could spur a quick donation and expression of anger

4258155 the soviet union doesnt exist anymore there is no such thing as ex soviet space
4258156 there is a new map of eastern europe and the border area of russia and i believe its actually in russias interest to come to terms with that its not in russias interest to continue to hanker for a soviet past because frankly its gone and its good that its gone
4258157 the united states britain france germany are not going to go to war with russia over south ossetia no matter how sympathetic we might be to the people of georgia were sympathetic to tibet were sympathetic to zimbabwe we dont contemplate military solutions to these problems and so nato membership is not the answer
4258158 you look at the u k and the u s not directly dependent on russian energy willing and able to take a sharper line with russia and if you look at the east of europe they also are fearful of russia and want to take a sharper line

4258304 and we have more and more teachers who are being considered highly qualified
4258305 its good to know that govans is a school thats been standing on its own
4258306 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4258307 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4258308 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4258309 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4258310 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4258311 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4258317 never never never was there any mention of the mayors name we should not be honoring the mayor we should be honoring survivors first respoders and neighborhood and faith based leaders

4258322 i dont know pandora i mean didnt president bush tell us the french werent the best allies recently how could i go against the pres you feel me
4258323 oh ho ho dont be silly we didnt choose it because its french we chose it because according to your tastes you enjoy synth rock electronica influences mild syncopation heavy bass line heavy synth hats beep beep beep those are your results

4258326 lekan has a broad knowledge of the rhythms that really are the basis for the music we play in america west african rhythms that have been there for centuries
4258327 its interesting to bring these two streams back together again the west african approach to rhythm together with how we are feeling about it as jazz musicians
4258328 it was fascinating to me to be marrying some very unusual rhythms with these standard songs
4258329 i have always placed more emphasis on rhythm than on melody and harmony because the tendency in western music is to downplay the importance of rhythm
4258330 if i did standards on every album that i did id run out of ideas its kind of a dead end situation
4258331 its great music yeah but you have to start to experiment find your own voice and its very difficult to do that if youre doing standards constantly one of the most important components of jazz is that it embraces tradition but at the same time it has to move forward
4258332 her own take on standards in a very contemporary manner
4258333 i think she brings the freshest take on standards of any artist ive heard
4258334 she has a very distinctive sound and style and very unusual arrangements to do an album like this and and reinvent herself without even trying is amazing her style is absolutely her own nothing borrowed about it
4258335 i think the real story here is what the musicians are doing
4258336 although i might be singing in a fairly conservative fashion at least for the first verse the musicians are doing some wild stuff from the get go
4258337 i love to get the musicians out of a certain comfort thing that they have to get them out of new york city and into a place thats just totally different
4258338 jackson is the biggest city in mississippi but youre not that far removed from a very strong sense of rural mississippi

4258340 i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4258341 mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation
4258342 a major part of whatever is dysfunctional is coming from the government side he is choosing to cover over that which is another reason why people dont trust mr harper

4258346 its fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about you can write it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you but it might be an idea you have

4258357 the clearest sign yet that french consumers long the bright spot in that economy are less and less willing to spend

4258359 we are not a suburban mall we dont have a parking lot people need to take their purchases and take it out to their car these are not always small things

4258364 would not adequately teach students the scientific principles methods and knowledge necessary for them to successfully study those subjects at uc
4258365 b y teaching students to reject scientific evidence and methodology whenever they might be inconsistent with the bible both texts fail to encourage critical thinking and the skills required for careful scientific analysis
4258366 reject the methodology generally accepted in science which relies on observation and experimentation and on the formulation of laws and theories that need to be tested rather than accepted on the basis of the bible or any other authority

4258374 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty after a lifetime of playing by the rules and working hard there was no guarantee of a secure retirement
4258375 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4258376 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4258377 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today one of the great successes of the 20th century today social security lifts nearly 13 million seniors and 1 3 million children out of poverty
4258378 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4258379 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans its a reflection of our values
4258380 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security

4258422 american used the wrong provisions of its minimum equipment list mel to return two md 83 aircraft to service after pilots had reported problems and flew the planes 58 times in violation of faa regulations
4258423 operated the first md 83 on eight flights in airspace it should have been restricted from after maintenance on part of the autopilot system was improperly deferred
4258424 although american mechanics correctly diagnosed the problem they again deferred maintenance under the wrong item of the mel as a result the aircraft operated on four revenue flights without a fully functioning autopilot
4258425 in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew

4258435 its rare to find all your film location needs in a single place and many times producers will be looking at both alaska and the yukon so when alaska came in with its incentive program its actually a bonus for both of us
4258436 wed rather have people think of north of 60 here instead of going to other places like new zealand scandinavia or greenland
4258437 were definitely seeing an increase in interest but it remains to be seen how many will actually shoot here

4258446 ba continues to hold the vast majority of heathrow slots over 40 percent and while it indicates it is willing to relinquish some these slots have been trading for as much as 60 million 30 million pounds per pair
4258447 so relinquishing 100 slot pairs would be a 6 billion asset disposal for which ba presumably wishes to receive fair value the devil is in the details
4258448 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations

4258452 there is a good chance that the economy is already in recession but even if it isnt the outlook remains for subdued growth in the quarters to come
4258453 the strains from the global economic downturn the surge in oil and commodity prices up until recently and the euro appreciation have been simply too strong
4258454 with growth slowing abruptly and inflation expectations off their peak risks of a near term ecb hike have been wiped out
4258455 inflation will remain at 4 0 percent in august but then decline so that by the end of the year inflation will be close to and possibly even under 3 percent
4258456 the french economy seems clearly to have entered a recessionary phase

4258461 incluso algunos asistentes entre ellos un sacerdote oriundo de temacapul n manifestaron que el tono utilizado por las autoridades fue amenazador y no de di logo agregaron que en una reuni n sostenida en casa jalisco a pesar de que los habitantes manifestaron su oposici n con la ampliaci n del proyecto inicial que era realizar la presa a una altura no mayor de 75 metros les dijeron que el proyecto era definitivo y que no se dar a marcha atr s

4258463 esta comisi n se ha percatado de que las autoridades del gobierno del estado intentan evadir su responsabilidad y participaci n en el proyecto
4258464 de las ltimas acciones realizadas en torno al proyecto de el zapotillo se advierte que el gobierno del estado y la conagua han ejercido acciones de presi n hacia los pobladores de las comunidades de temacapul n acacico y palmarejo las cuales confunden a sus habitantes y provocan incertidumbre no s lo de trascendencia jur dica sino social y moral con consecuencias m s all de las materiales que han afectado su vida y salud sobre todo de personas de la tercera edad cuyo porcentaje es alto en esa regi n
4258465 acciones coercitivas como la instalaci n de lonas carteles y espectaculares en el quiosco de la plaza principal para notificar a la poblaci n la reubicaci n de la comunidad a pesar de existir un acuerdo verbal con el titular del poder ejecutivo de que no se llevar a a cabo la construcci n si la mayor a de los pobladores afectados no estaban de acuerdo hacen ver que han sido relegados en lugar de ser escuchados y de que se les hayan facilitado los medios para promover su participaci n en el proyecto
4258466 esto significa un acto de arbitrariedad contrario a los principios democr ticos que prev nuestra legislaci n

4258477 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world

4258481 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

4258488 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
4258489 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
4258490 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

4258517 if there was a trial and if there were guarantees we would take part in it
4258518 i respect islam and its followers and i have nothing against it however i will not apologize we have freedom of the press and religion in denmark i cant apologize i respect islam and i did not target it
4258519 blaspheming the prophet mohammed and islam as well as sowing religious and sectarian discord

4258541 sort of its summer break so my friends and i spend a lot of time playing games cause we dont have much else to do were trying to take it easy before we go off to college twister is my favorite game cause it gives me an excuse to get in crazy positions and stick my ass out in the air it always leads to me having dirty thoughts
4258542 well i imagine that everyone playing is naked both the boys and the girls our legs are spread open and were all tangled over each other eventually we start groping each other and then kissing and licking and even fucking right there on the mat

4258546 i have been contacted by bloggers from all over the world including kuwait and the us
4258547 we will have a special website set up for the code and i suspect it will be taken as a template that people can adopt to their own circumstances
4258548 it is open to every self respecting human being who is against hate speech and wants to eliminate discrimination and hatred
4258549 until i saw these two videos i had no idea just how stupid it is to say anything official to a policeman until you have a lawyer present zip your lips i knew that anything i say can be held against me i did not know that anything i say that is favorable to me will be automatically objected to as hearsay by the other attorney and automatically upheld by the judge this means that talking to a policeman no matter what is a lose lose deal for the talker the 21 minute presentation by the policeman is informative on how the police get 80 of people to confess to something
4258550 one lady said she saw our marquee that said last chance to pray before you get on 385
4258551 we had one lady that drove thru and her request was so important and troublesome to her we couldnt really tell what the problem was so we just prayed with her while she cried you know
4258552 we wanted it to be where you come stop have someone to pray with and be on your way in a few minutes
4258553 not everybody has somebody than can pray with so well just be out here waiting
4258554 we can never insure one hundred percent of the population against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty ridden old age
4258555 transformation of the nitrogen cycle recent trends questions and potential solutions
4258556 most of these systems were not hypoxic when first studied but it appears that from the middle of the past century the dissolved oxygen concentrations of many coastal ecosystems have been adversely affected by eutrophication
4258557 the key to reducing dead zones will be to keep fertilizers on the land and out of the sea
4258558 for agricultural systems in general methods need to be developed that close the nutrient cycle from soil to crop and back to agricultural soil
4258559 we believe it would be unrealistic to return to preindustrial levels of nutrient input but an appropriate management goal would be to reduce nutrient inputs to levels that occurred in the middle of the past century before eutrophication began to spread dead zones globally
4258560 there should be two or three more software ipos by now
4258561 when trading you are committing your money to something that you have no control over so you have to do it in a way to keep yourself out of trouble you need a system to help you in volatile markets
4258562 i believe this change will be a significant improvement in our ability to serve the public
4258563 a cellular call will now be routed immediately to the appropriate public safety dispatch center saving precious minutes

4258574 it has a safety value making everyone slow down a little bit
4258575 they did an incredible job to try and revive him they worked on him for over two hours but in vain
4258576 indeed words would be an empty vessel save for the deeds like water that fill
4258577 as the heavy snows bend the bough so will the might of dominance either with or without permission cause one to flex

4258580 he called me a rapist and a recluse im not a recluse
4258581 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4258582 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4258583 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4258584 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4258585 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4258586 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4258587 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4258588 i imagine that theres a couple guys on that team that remember that 8 0 loss
4258589 right down from our first line to our fourth line weve got guys who have been putting the puck in the net since they were little kids
4258590 the shots and the goals weve had the leads weve had just says it for itself
4258591 we unfortunately gave one up in the first shift of the first period
4258592 it can be a bad habit scenario if you allow it to be but our guys are very mature
4258593 tem pessoas que merecem serem felizes s pq n o sou n o vou permitir que o outro seja

4258596 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4258597 d irect eye contact open mouths and exposed teeth also have defined a few faculty meetings over the course of my career what better way to convey shared governance than by sharing food with the director serving colleagues a lunch that he prepared
4258598 in a history course the university rejected the text instructed students that
4258599 t his is about quality and comparability and making sure students arent set up for failure
4258600 this report by the way is consistent with what the doctors found when she was hospitalized right after the event before she was released to jail so so far the doctors have all been consistent
4258601 the office of emergency management is monitoring the citys electrical system 24 hours a day year round
4258602 we deploy something called a power outage response team so that when there is a report we send folks out into the communities to define the extent the geographic extent of the outage identify critical facilities that may be impacted and to work with at risk populations
4258603 i think about the families and i feel for their loss they have a great theyre like us were in the same boat of pain and suffering of a lifetime
4258604 she was the go to person and she was the glue that kept our families together
4258605 not only in our judicial system but our insurance system and they need to close all those loopholes so that when these people lose their license they have no avenues to go down they need to close those avenues
4258606 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4258607 to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to ensure that all lines of communications and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
4258608 you have heard the statement by the us president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
4258609 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defense ministry
4258610 continue our efforts to rally the free world in defense of a free georgia
4258611 reshaping us policy toward russia will take longer than the months between now and january 20 when a new president takes office but mr bush can at least atone for his earlier misjudgments about mr putin and steer policy in a new direction that his successor would have to deal with
4258612 this outbreak of hostilities is a very disappointing setback in the peace process hopefully the situation will stabilize so we can resume peacebuilding measures
4258613 when an agreement is concluded the trips may be recommended again
4258614 it is what we have tried feverishly to avoid by taking necessary steps to facilitate tanyas safe and expenditious return to her grandma in belarus
4258615 i would just say the family believes its a shame if the belarusin government takes any actions against existing or future programs for young children based on the decision of one girl
4258616 its a shame and a tragedy and theres no reason for it
4258617 he sits enthroned above the circle of the earth and its people are like grasshoppers he stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in
4258618 he spreads out the northern skies over empty space he suspends the earth over nothing
4258619 he took him outside and said look up at the heavens and count the stars if indeed you can count them then he said to him so shall your offspring be
4258620 the valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the lord at the blast of breath from his nostrils
4258621 in the six hundredth year of noahs life on the seventeenth day of the second month on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth and the floodgates of the heavens were opened
4258622 o lord our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth when i consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have set in place you made him man ruler over the works of your hands you put everything under his feet the birds of the air and the fish of the sea all that swim the paths of the seas
4258623 he wraps up the waters in his clouds yet the clouds do not burst under their weight
4258624 he draws up the drops of water which distill as rain to the streams the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind
4258625 the wind blows to the south and turns to the north round and round it goes ever returning on its course all streams flow into the sea yet the sea is never full to the place the streams come from there they return again
4258626 in the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands they will perish but you remain they will all wear out like a garment like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded
4258627 the advantage of the ordnance is the upfront enforcement ability to exclude people who are committing crimes
4258628 i am not against immigration i am against illegal immigration
4258629 thanks to safer vehicles aggressive law enforcement and our efforts countless families were spared the devastating news that a loved one was not coming home
4258630 what attracted me to the project was this story this beautiful tiny love story in an epic setting
4258631 the opportunities there for movement are so many its a thrilling story to be able to tell and a puzzle as well
4258632 the journey of a tale of two cities i started in 2004 when we were finishing assassins and its been an amazing journey so rewarding
4258633 we had the out of town tryout in sarasota at the asolo sold that out and im so excited to be here
4258634 i had already written a really really terrible wuthering heights musical and my brother convinced me go somewhere else with that because everyones dead at the end its just depressing you need to have something positive
4258635 so i looked around for another story that would be equally romantic and epic and have all those passions that i found so intriguing as a teenager and i read a tale of two cities and i fell in love with it
4258636 a francia no la podemos enfrentar de t a t porque t cnicamente son muy superiores

4258655 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

4258657 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4258658 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4258661 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4258662 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4258663 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4258664 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4258665 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4258666 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4258667 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4258668 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4258669 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4258670 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4258671 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4258672 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4258673 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4258674 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4258675 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4258676 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4258677 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4258678 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4258679 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4258680 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4258681 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4258682 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4258683 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4258684 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4258685 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4258686 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4258687 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4258688 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4258689 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4258690 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4258691 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4258692 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4258693 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4258694 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4258695 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4258696 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4258697 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

4258701 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba

4258703 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4258704 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4258705 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4258706 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4258707 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4258708 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4258709 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4258710 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4258711 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4258712 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4258713 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4258714 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4258715 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4258716 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4258717 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4258718 wow if he can overcome his difficulties to actually walk around the store i can overcome difficulties and accomplish my goals as well

4258733 some of the old images and expressions of masculinity are disappearing from society most obviously the relationship between men and their work has undergone a revolution a model of work built on physical endeavour is slowly being replaced by an emphasis on intellectual and emotional labour women are beginning to break through the glass ceiling displacing men as the principal earners for the first time

4258856 we feel very disappointed because the evidence given was from primary sources
4258857 the pm has made his intentions clear that he wants to fight graft so he must look into this case

4258861 some people are quite vulnerable to depression but it doesnt emerge until the highly stressful years of separation and trying to grow into adulthood
4258862 kids with depression and anxiety disorders should be able to succeed with good treatment
4258863 i think its harder but it shouldnt be a block to their being successful
4258864 i dont think its going to reach the level of the balkans because i think frankly some of it is being fanned by the russian government

4258874 we knew that we had to put something really grand here but this is a space that everybody in the community knows
4258875 what does it mean to just choose a few street artists and paste work onto the side of an art institution if it already exists outside on sides of buildings what makes this so special
4258876 theyve had to bring the street art to the middle classes so they can feel cool or they can feel cool by slating it
4258877 the list of artists and contributors who have graced the pages of arkitip now reads like a whos who of popular culture many of which received exposure in arkitip long before the mainstream took notice
4258878 again this is an important game for us because it presents us with another chance to be together in a game situation
4258879 there is nothing better than playing and working on our approach we are preparing for cuba of course there are some players not here with the team but for the players that are here now it is a chance to prepare ourselves against an international opponent

4258905 we are excited about this acquisition and the opportunity to assist in growing what we believe to be a leading appraisal management company in the industry pipefire is well known to us from our days as a retail lender as we used its services in our operation with the enhanced focus on the appraisal process as the result of the recent downturn in the housing market we feel we can provide a valuable service to the lending community
4258906 while we cannot expect this transaction or streetlinks to resolve the significant challenges novastar still faces we view the acquisition as a positive step toward reestablishing niche operations in the residential housing market
4258907 while we were not looking to sell the company we could not pass up the chance to bring together the talents technology and experience of our companies at a time when our value proposition to the lending community has never been stronger

4258911 it directors are reasonably confident about the outlook over the next 12 months despite lingering economic uncertainty
4258912 it departments savaged headcounts after the dot com and y2k booms but we appear to be a long way from a repeat of that scenario since the market collapsed in 2001 and 2002 it directors have been much more restrained in their hiring so it departments do not have a skills surplus
4258913 there appears to be no end of the candidate market in sight with skills acquisition and retention still a pressing concern for it directors
4258914 we are still seeing acute shortages of candidates with net proficiency for example and project management experience remains highly sought after
4258915 normally in a downturn you would expect to see it departments shedding staff and utilising greater numbers of contractors the focus on increasing permanent headcounts is a good barometer of robust demand over the longer term
4258916 many people arent aware that these bans on drilling must be renewed every year and that all we have to do is to allow these prohibitions to expire on oct 1

4258921 the most important things are the hardest things to say they are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when theyre brought out but its more than that isnt it the most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away and you may make revelations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way not understanding what youve said at all or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it thats the worst i think when the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear

4258972 a lot of guys came with the same passion the same hunger from that night and we didnt forget how well they played against us
4258973 we just play basketball we dont try to send messages
4258974 we just pass the ball to him and let him shoot within his range what i do is defend and rebound
4258975 its the only thing he could do when the office gave him late case law information its frustrating but i dont blame the judge
4258976 anytime theres a delay in a court case its frustrating
4258977 but id much rather have the court make a ruling in accordance with the law for a small delay than a judge make the wrong decision

4259031 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again

4259045 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4259049 profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4259050 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4259051 my personal view is that there need to be some consequences for the actions that russia has taken against a sovereign state
4259052 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4259053 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4259054 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4259055 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia i see no reason to change that approach today

4259067 i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russias future behaviour
4259068 it should offer a privileged partnership if russia is ready to adopt european values going forward
4259069 it would be in the interests of both sides if the relationship developed into such a partnership the pre conditions are not present in russia today but ties could move in that direction
4259070 there are three main areas of work midwifery bonesetting and medicinal plants
4259071 the promoters of reproductive health work in birthing birth control and womens health as women we have the right to health to not be left sick in the house to not be beaten
4259072 the problem we have is that alot of our necessities arent met we need access to hospitalization for patients medications for the birthing materials sheets shelves jars alcohol to make plant tinctures plyers gloves stethoscopes and thermometers
4259073 we use pills from allopathic medicine but also plants we dont want to forget the knowledge and culture of our ancestors who cured themselves with plants thats why were organizing ourselves so we dont lose this knowledge and you shoudl organize yourselves to take back your culture
4259074 in 1994 the insurgents came to live in this land and we brought them food in 1996 we had to go up into the mountains to live because the army came when we were up there we felt really sad because we didnt have a space to live in now we have a place for ourselves and our children to make ourselves at home to work the land
4259075 this land is 6 500 hectares and is owned by just one person the boss of the plantation paid us 5 pesos a day and sometimes didnt even pay us he paid us every 15 days of work and then came to see if the work was well done but if it didnt meet his standards he didnt pay us no one could come through here without asking permission the compa eros wanted to kick out the plantation owner but he hired gunmen to scare them and the gunmen shot at them when we saw that people were organizing we said were gonna join in the movement what happens happens
4259076 the plantation owner mistreated us we only had a little space to live in and the rest of the land was property of the owner he even took away our animals he didnt allow us to wash or bath in the river after alot of begging he let us use part of the river
4259077 we havent taken anything from anyone theyve taken everything from us this land belongs to us because were the ones who work it
4259078 we 20 people visited la realidad the health and education promoters spoke with us about their autonomy we went to the community of santa rosa and saw the clinic and the school where there are 22 education promoters the progress of the zapatistas is incredible in 1995 the soldiers stationed themselves at the side of the communities water source and denied them access to it the soldiers stayed there for 2 years the people had to walk 1 3 hours to get water
4259079 59 of us went to various communities in la morelia were working on spreading information about the struggle in the communities learning from the compa eros in these communities our critique of ourselves and how to continue in solidarity with our compa eros zapatistas
4259080 our heart is with you we hope you get out of jail soon from the revolutionary lands you are not alone we are with you
4259081 46 of us went to oventic we went to the community of venustiano carranza in the municipality of cruzton the people of this community had the title to the property of the land but a group invaded protected by the government and they tried to take the land they contaminated the peoples water supply with agricultural fertilizers and the people became sick from the water in may 2007 they retook their land and so the government threatened to put them in jail issuing 11 orders of aprehension for defending their land on april 27th the police entered with the orders of aprehension they denied the people of access to their cornfield and now it is overrgrown with weeds on july 18th the people returned to their land an the police arrested of of them a member of the other youth and so the people started a guard duty to protect themselves they sleep with the tension that the church bell will ring the signal that the police are coming there are also canadian mining companies who want to mine for gold in their land we shared alot with them learning he italians cooked pasta every night we have a piece of cruzton in our hearts and we hold on to it
4259082 in the past few years the government has tried to take the land away from us to sell and privatize the natural resources they already sodl to coca cola they want to install a botelling factory to build a highway to unearth the mayan ruins and develop tourist projects foreigners have built their vacation homes in these 300 hectares live many indigenous communities 400 year old ancient trees drinking water for these communities and a neighborhoodin san cristobal and 2 zapatista support bases in march 2007 the zapatistas created the civil camp for the peace to defend this land with the guard duty changing every week in the first few months people paid by the pri political party came to run the zapatistas out of the support bases and some pri supporters sold their land to the government there is still one group that recieves money from the government and continues bothering the camp
4259083 my familys modest financial means would have made a hotel stay very difficult my mother and i would have to endure the surgery alone
4259084 thankfully this burden was lifted from my family when the ronald mcdonald house in fargo opened its doors to my family at no cost my parents and brother were there to support me the whole time
4259085 the doctors saved my life and so did the ronald mcdonald house
4259086 the house was a sanctuary for us it made it possible for my family to stay close and keep my spirits up that made my treatment so much easier and much more successful
4259087 i was bald too and my brother always told me people love you for who you are not for your hair
4259088 then they moved to the ronald mcdonald house all their needs were taken care of and they were able to concentrate on just giving me love and attention for me it was literally a life saver
4259089 auch eine reaktion auf die verweigerung von cdu und fdp realistische optionen f r eine regierung in hessen anzubieten
4259090 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4259091 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4259092 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4259093 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4259094 after the strike canceled the 1994 world series and led to the coldest winter along came cal

4259096 no subpoena was ever issued for your telephone toll records

4259099 i told him that we would be asking our general counsel to look into this
4259100 wed still like to know more about how this happened and how the bureau is securing against similar violations in the future
4259101 perhaps we were a little bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse for tonight
4259102 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4259103 in the first half we had too many unforced errors and needed to play in their half and not get trapped in our half which is what happened
4259104 in the second half they put people behind the ball and played on the break which they did very well
4259105 we needed to be dynamic and more personality and drive the play fair play to the opposition though they understand the counter attack game and executed it well
4259106 we are short of a few players and are a bit light so were still in the market for players the match is only at half time
4259107 i could not think at all about the game on sunday until we had played tonight but i was very pleased with some of the football we played
4259108 after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soliders traveling to war zones the choice for us to forego payment for a third check bag from the department of defense was clear

4259111 the wise woman builds up her home but the foolish woman tears it down with her own hands
4259112 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4259113 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past

4259121 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4259122 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4259123 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover

4259141 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4259142 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
4259143 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4259144 if i were to return my iphone now i would wait until february 2009 to buy it again after next month apple needs to ramp up for year end holiday sales there is no window of time available to redesign the 3g circuitry replace all the existing 3g iphones and build up adequate inventories for the holidays holiday sales are too valuable to risk an inventory shortage if a recall is advised i expect that it wont be issued until 2009

4259370 same here i just want to say i am glad you are my brother mom would be so proud you completely changed your life around and you are finally happy again
4259371 your life is like a mosaic in the midst of me piecing you together the enemy has inserted pieces of infirmity he has used your circumstances to fragment your soul he has tried to keep the brokenness in you so you cannot form the new picture and vision for your future
4259372 years ago i had just left a church after less than positive experiences feeling hurt by various events that had happened
4259373 during this time period late 80s early 90s the lord was using a series of conferences called catch the fire to do just that stir people up with a renewed passion for him
4259374 some of my friends had already been to catch the fire meetings and really were excited about them so i decided to attend one of these conferences in dallas with a group of my houston friends
4259375 one day during a time when the spirit of the lord had fallen mightily on the huge crowd the lord showed me a picture of a very low flame and said to me that
4259376 in case you are young enough to have experienced only electric ovens let me explain about pilot lights and gas ovens
4259377 i thank god that he has put us in a body of believers for i remember how wonderful i felt after friends had laid hands and prayed for my restoration that day
4259378 so how do we restore passion when our pilot lights are low well i had to turn to others to get help initially
4259379 i feel there are even those in the body who are pilot lights that cause the rest of us to whoosh with passion and revelation
4259380 after all we are admonished to encourage one another all the more as the day approaches and boy does it seem to be approaching
4259381 this whole time i have tried to avoid using let your little light shine in my pilot light metaphor and i almost made it but now i find myself weakening here towards the end
4259382 my heart is steadfast o god i will sing and give praise awake my glory like the harp and the lute awake my glory
4259383 we all feel confident this is the strongest album weve made
4259384 the material is a mix of beautiful melancholic leads and harsh dissonant rhythms all the despair driven hooks and dark atmosphere youve come to expect from us
4259385 as thoughtful and compellingly musical as it is bleak and vengeful essential
4259386 queremos esfuerzo ante todo para esto no se requiere clases de lectura de ni as se requiere inteligencia y voluntad pol tica los recursos ya los tiene el gobierno s lo le pedimos que no los dilapide d ndoselos a las est pidas que se quieren ir al cielo
4259387 cu ntos polic as con el respeto que me merecen como seres humanos acuden como su ltimo recurso de empleo ser polic as cuando el ser polic a requiere de una profesionalizaci n pero tambi n una m nima escolaridad
4259388 la penalizaci n perpetua y a n la pena de muerte no impedir n que los delincuentes sigan operando es la confianza en la autoridad de que cumplir con su funci n lo que provocar que la sociedad entera coadyuve preventivamente a disuadir la comisi n de delitos
4259389 its interesting you know theyre both the same age theyre both monster superstars cultural myths almost from the 1980s into the 1990s but in so many ways theyre hard to compare
4259390 one could argue that as a musician a dancer and an entertainer michael jackson has it all over madonna by a factor of 10
4259391 hes the guy whos up there with frank sinatra bing crosby elvis presley one of the top musical performers in our cultural history
4259392 it didnt sell as well as her music did a few years ago but it was a number one album and if anyone has ever proven that shes able of reinventing herself thats madonna
4259393 madonna has managed to stay creative and to stay relevant i think she still is in the popular music scene
4259394 i dont know what shell be like at 60 but mick jagger is there and hes rocking and rolling
4259395 theres no shrewder businesswoman she could probably run a music studio
4259396 he got to the point that he was so rich so powerful and so famous that he was allowed to kind of withdraw from any kind of reality
4259397 michael jackson is the example of someone who was truly spoiled and by spoiled i mean ruined by the level of fame that he achieved
4259398 he accidentally turned himself into a parody of himself and then its kind of hard to re emerge as a serious performer
4259399 i dont think its impossible i think hes still got talent but then you tie that in with the trial and that made an awful lot of people terribly uncomfortable
4259400 jackson withstood a trial which was very ugly and was vindicated the idea that he could be a pedophile having that in the news is not going to make your career any good
4259401 tui continues to expect a significant increase in underlying earnings by each of the two divisions tourism and container shipping for the year as a whole
4259402 we think there is a growing risk that hapag lloyd is not sold which would be the third time a proposed separation has been scuppered
4259403 despite the expected downturn in h2 2008 in the container shipping segment we stick to our positive outlook for 2008
4259404 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4259405 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4259406 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4259407 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4259408 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4259409 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4259410 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4259411 hes the guy that wonders if youd still be there tomorrow if the music decided to get up and walk out on him hes concerned hes intelligent and he came to take care of business he drove all night to make sure
4259412 once you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains no matter how bizarre bewildering or over the top must have been what really happened
4259413 its only at the very end in 2005 that truthers became more vocal they just woke up one morning and decided to take this on as an issue
4259414 now theres a new version for the screen conspiracies have become big business
4259415 big explosion blew us he and nyc corporation counsel michael hess back into the 8th floor
4259416 there was an eerie sound the whole building went dark and the staircase that i was standing on just gave way
4259417 the firefighter who took us down kept saying do not look down and i kept saying why and were stepping over people and you know you can feel when youre stepping over people
4259418 and they made that decision to pull uh and we watched the building collapse
4259419 they made that decision to pull the rescue workers out of the area just in time because not long after we watched the building collapse
4259420 i ask every viewer to come to their own conclusion about the language larrys using
4259421 the scale of the conspiracy has grown to include not just the government and foreign intelligence but police fire service and even the media
4259422 since 9 11 mark loizeaux and his company controlled demolition inc have been the subject of a hate campaign and even accused sic of mass murder
4259423 but i think there are ways to handle it and ways that you dont handle it and you certainly dont terrorize terrorize people like the good folks that work here and family members
4259424 mark loizeaux is not unbiased he doesnt want to lose his top clients
4259425 it was very upsetting about a year ago because of the level of persecution and the virulence in which i was spoken about
4259426 its just very unfortunate that this whole rather ridiculous situation has grown out of whats really a very small and very honest mistake
4259427 we dont need to ask permission from the owner no
4259428 thats why i would know that there is no conspiracy cause for me to be a part of that would be obscene and it disgusts me to even think of it
4259429 this is it were dead were not gonna make it out of here the landing that we were standing on gave way i was left there hanging we were trapped on the eighth floor with smoke thick smoke all around us after the big explosion
4259430 this is some of the only footage of the south face of wtc 7
4259431 and the abc news video shows the whole side engulfed in smoke
4259432 were looking at the upper floors of tower 7 you could see columns gone floors collapsed heavy smoke coming out and fire the upper floors were an inferno
4259433 the main fires were concentrated on floors six through to thirteen there were fires initially on some of the upper floors
4259434 i think 9 11 skeptics have no respect for all the people that died that day its like a slap in their face
4259435 ive heard people talk about it that come from cincinnati and california i was here you werent
4259436 truthers had a big head start when i got involved in this in april of 2006 there were already over a million pages on the internet devoted to 9 11 conspiracy theories
4259437 there is simply no evidence that you could show them that theyre wrong
4259438 the entire game with them is picking little anomalies out but not connecting them in any coherent way
4259439 theres no coherent hypothesis and we keep asking for one
4259440 9 11 skeptics dont understand government and clearly have never worked in government
4259441 will tell you two things the government doesnt have the competence for a large scale conspiracy and number two it cant maintain secrecy
4259442 wtc 7 had a lot of security there was always police officers and undercover cops out front it was very very heavily guarded
4259443 could one use a controlled demolition on any building sure did it happen to wtc 7 on 9 11 no it did not
4259444 i dont care what kind of fucking experience he has man you honestly think richard clarke is going to come out and say oh yeah of course the government was a part of it oh yeah of course there was a cover up no hes going to toe the fucking party line hes going to defend his ex bosses cmon man
4259445 declaring a man to be what he is not in fact
4259446 always acknowledged the true element here in the catholic doctrine without sanctioning its pelagianistic trait
4259447 actualization of this principle in his person is itself conditioned by the declaratory act creative at the same time going before

4259466 ea partners gives independent developers like epic the muscle of a global publisher like ea along with the focus and flexibility of a smaller team committed to working with our individual needs
4259467 i have the utmost respect for every single wrestler but you know colin colin delaney hes an underdog and he turned on tommy dreamer and that showed a lot of self confidence so it would be interesting what i could do with him although there is the very appealing matt hardy part of the hardy brothers you cant go wrong there
4259468 id love to give colin a make over and then see what happens you know i think i should propose a match between matt hardy and colin delaney and whoever wins would get me as a valet
4259469 there is a rich history to the civil war especially in terms of covert military tactics
4259470 american warfare in the 1860s was brutal yet surprisingly sophisticated so it was essential for us to capture this duality
4259471 people think its too expensive and too hard for them to do
4259472 but you dont have to be super smart to do it if you can drive a car you could fly a plane
4259473 a lot of airports dont let you get near the planes because theyre fragile and expensive
4259474 we take them down lake michigan they see big red and go by port sheldon

4259493 but i dont have stories like yours to tell ive never been anywhere i dont serve as the muse for billy collins most powerful poetry and i dont vacation in the south of france with johnny depp and that twig waif he calls a partner like you do
4259494 sales are now slower than they were on launch day but not too much the sales didnt just die after the first few days as they do with some games
4259495 as a result it looks like i will be able to make the next game without needing to get a job that would interfere with that the estimated sales so far of 55 000 are not enough for this but extrapolating into the future the situation looks safe thank you once again for making that possible
4259496 the year over year decrease in earnings is mainly attributable to the decline in administration fee revenue in the capital markets and asset administration operations of blackmont and a decrease in assets under administration at assante wealth management
4259497 however blackmont continued to make important contributions to our business despite the industry wide slowdown in investment banking activity
4259498 duic acted contrary to ontario securities law and contrary to the public interest by engaging in the transactions in breach of the cease trade order

4259502 canadas housing market is running into some seriously foul weather amid the weakest affordability in nearly two decades
4259503 however the drop in july spread to a few more cities including the previously untouchable vancouver market
4259504 this combination of mounting new listings and fading sales has pushed the market into buyers territory in many cities rapidly undercutting pricing power
4259505 the combination of a larger inventory of homes for sale and fewer home sales means less upward pressure on home prices in many markets
4259506 there is no doubt the canadian real estate market is pulling back from the record sales and price increase levels of 2007 which was a record year for mls sales
4259507 while we still doubt that canada will stage an instant replay of the trauma in the u s markets even a mild version would be bad news
4259508 people viewed the commodity headwinds as just so severe that any time you get a pullback in the commodities the market will try to make some headway
4259509 this market that were in it was led down by the financials so now were going to have to see it led back out of this morass by the financials as well
4259510 i think were certainly in that trend now its starting to have positive tones under the market
4259511 its just a market that has all the feeling of continuing to work lower until we get some definitive evidence that demand is going to improve because of lower pump prices and that seems a long ways off
4259512 i think buyers are a bit edgy about the russia georgia situation knowing thats not completely resolved theyre looking for some geopolitical risk premium
4259513 according to our calculations the exchange rate development has contributed 12 30 per barrel to the decline in oil prices since mid july when the u s dollar hit a low of 1 6 against the euro

4259523 a piece of scholarship and a good one at that
4259524 all you left wing bloggers who want to smear mr corsi
4259525 theres over 300 pages 700 footnotes and ill stand by the truth of every statement in this book
4259526 a large number of e mails were received from readers objecting that obama was not the messiah but rather the biblical antichrist prefigured in saint johns apocalypse
4259527 i had to read it about six times before i began to figure it out
4259528 why obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
4259529 what is obama trying to hide and why would he do so
4259530 that obamas father was a polygamist and an alcoholic may or may not tell us much about obama
4259531 interestingly obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather missing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii
4259532 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
4259533 in the introduction that he wrote after this was going with the second book and the original book had no dedication page and this is not the typical way that you dedicate a book so im making the distinction there is no dedication page in the book at all never has been
4259534 never states precisely how many wives his father had or how many half brothers and sisters he has from different mothers
4259535 sayid obama was not even sure how many wives his brother had
4259536 obama blames racism for breaking up his parents marriage not his fathers polygamist ways
4259537 obama is again lying about history to claim jfk had anything to do with bringing his father to the united states to study
4259538 obama senior following the prescripts of islamic sharia law divorced
4259539 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond
4259540 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4259541 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family
4259542 what would be heard by most listeners is that obama hates the military so much that he might leave the united states defenseless against our enemies
4259543 i did not see my brother practice islam especially after he came back from his studies in the united states
4259544 there is no doubt obama senior was a muslim by birth and upbringing
4259545 obama did attend a government run public school in indonesia and he did receive islamic instruction including study of the koran
4259546 barack obama is not and never has been a muslim
4259547 that physical description does not match the indonesia television news videos showing the house
4259548 it is hard to decipher what obama might be trying to hide by not being clear about the specific location of the houses where he lived in jakarta
4259549 the black man who tried to peel off his skin
4259550 advertisements in the negro magazines still hymn nadinola skin bleach lightens and brightens skin
4259551 the entire episode suggests what psychologists call hypothetical lying in other words imagining something that has not happened but imagining it with so much precise detail that the made up memory functions for the person as if it were real
4259552 has obama lost the ability to tell the difference between something that actually happened and something he invented
4259553 after the date obama wants us to think he left indonesia
4259554 the puzzle just adds to the growing list of factual discrepancies or outright fabrications that obama manufactures very likely on an ongoing basis
4259555 if we cant trust you to remember which magazine you read in indonesia when you were 9 how can we possibly ever trust you to protect our country
4259556 asked me to run as its presidential candidate in 2008
4259557 boy buggering in both islam and catholicism is okay with the pope as long as it isnt reported by the liberal press
4259558 didnt john kerry begin practicing judiasm he also has paternal grandparents that were jewish what religion is john kerry
4259559 obamas mother chose another third world prospect for her second husband
4259560 the race obama embraces is not that of his mother although he does have that choice
4259561 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4259562 if obama does win the presidency in 2008 he will be the first president in our history to have an extended family in another country
4259563 we cant yet get the authentic birth certificate im convinced its a forgery
4259564 if a birth certificate were forged and put on a website its conceivable that somebody committed a felony
4259565 president bush intends to abrogate u s sovereignty to the north american union a new economic and political entity which the president is quietly forming why doesnt president bush just tell the truth his secret agenda is to dissolve the united states of america into the north american union
4259566 nobody has worked harder to convince people that the completely moronic north american conspiracy theory is real
4259567 many of the black rage paragraphs obama wrote in dreams from my father bear a striking resemblance to passages frantz fanon wrote in his first book black skin white masks
4259568 ray assured me that we would never talk about whites without knowing exactly what we were doing without knowing that there might be a price to pay
4259569 for several years certain laboratories have been trying to produce a serum for denegrification
4259570 frantz fanons revolutionary writings were instrumental in shaping obamas own political analysis of race
4259571 we do not know if obama senior ever shared fanons writings with his son but much of the expression of black resentment obama offers in dreams from my father appears strongly influenced by fanons pages
4259572 obama railed against the same forms of racial oppression his father must have felt under british colonialism
4259573 the use of change as a political slogan dates back to socialist saul alinsky and his desire to cause a radical redistribution of income from the haves to the have nots in america
4259574 obama has borrowed phrases freely even from movies taking bamboozled from spike lees movie about malcolm x and the phrase he is the one from the matrix movie series
4259575 is a plagiarist plain and simple he cannot be trusted
4259576 likes to present himself as the distinguished professor of education at the university of illinois at chicago
4259577 could easily block obama from the white house and not just in 2008 but forever
4259578 in his eleven year reign of underground terror ayers participated in thirty bombings
4259579 palmer would never have introduced obama to the hyde park political community at the ayres dohrn home unless she saw an affinity between ayers and dohrns radical leftist history her own history of far leftist politics and the politics of barack obama
4259580 either he did not know ayers and dohrn are still radical leftists in which case he is implausibly naive or obama did know which would confirm he joined with ayers and dohrn because obama too continues to believe albeit silently and secretly in the far lefts radical agenda
4259581 even today ayers appears to hold the same radical political beliefs he did in the weather underground and obama had to know that was also the case when he first met ayers in 1995
4259582 mccarthy era committees seeking to expose communists considered to be a security threat
4259583 when obama tells audiences that his community organizing experience taught me a lot about listening to people as opposed to coming with a premeditated agenda he is reciting pure alinsky dogma
4259584 conservative columnist ann coulter has characterized obamas dreams from my father as a dimestore mein kampf
4259585 obama engages in what appears to be animated conversation with the professor
4259586 bookcase in the quincy house dorm included titles by karl marx and howard zinn
4259587 the socialist viewpoint is a magazine published by the socialist workers organization a group that describes itself as formed to advance the revolutionary marxist political program in the united states
4259588 little green footballs has called graham felsen a hardcore marxist
4259589 exactly what is a democratic candidate doing with a staffer who acts as the campaigns publics face when the staffer is featured in marxist publications
4259590 how possibly can obama argue his association with radicals such as bill ayers and bernardine dohrn was a long time ago when he continues to recruit a marxist sympathizer such as sam graham felsen to be an official blogger of his 2008 presidential campaign
4259591 reverend wright adapted the phrase to imply that the terrorist attacks of 9 11 were divine retribution for white americas continuing racial injustice
4259592 how could obama know these were the subjects of wrights sermons unless he had heard them
4259593 before obamas baptism at trinity when he was nearly thirty years old there is no other life incident evidencing he is a christian
4259594 a calculated decision to position yourself favorably in the eyes of those you want to lead whether you believe in the decision or not
4259595 along with other prominent black leaders such as al sharpton and barack obama farrakhan helped lead the million man march on washington
4259596 obamas supporters who clearly want to move obama as far away from farrakhan as possible will be certain to disavow that obama had any leadership role in farrakhans 1995 march
4259597 obamas 2006 trip to kenya evidenced his continued ties to a raila odinga a fellow luo tribesman who was running for president of kenya as a muslim sympathizer with well known communist political roots
4259598 obama by being seen this prominently with odinga in public had injected himself into the presidential contest on the side of his tribesman
4259599 senator obama has continued to insert himself into kenyan politics
4259600 morriss showing up in kenya makes no sense outside the obama odinga connection
4259601 morris had been openly critical of hillary clintons campaign against obama
4259602 as we shall see rezko was persistent ultimately convincing obama to drop working for political organizing causes so he could supplement the dwindling advance he had received at harvard to write a book with real income as a lawyer working the small chicago law firm where the lead partner did much of rezkos slumlord legal work for him
4259603 obama could work for rezko indirectly and benefit from rezkos connections
4259604 the likelihood is that rezko played a role in getting obama to join davis miner barnhill amp galland
4259605 alinsky taught that power was everything and that image words and positioning were just methods to capture power working from communities up
4259606 took steps that helped davis and rezko in their business relationship
4259607 continued to work for a law firm that had rezko as a client
4259608 there is no record that illinois state senator obama ever so much as placed a speech in the record objecting to the public housing practices perpetuated in his district by tony rezko let alone calling for investigation of rezko and his business practices
4259609 in an article titled obama is one lucky fellow rezko watch found it was unlikely that sreenan would actually construct any condos on the lot he had bought from rita rezko
4259610 even if no illegality is ever identified obamas continued willingness to take campaign contributions from his friend rezko even after serious allegations about rezkos low income housing empire began to be raised have the feel of impropriety
4259611 investigative reporters have drawn a line from obama to rezko to saddam husseins oil for food scandal with the key connecting point being billionaire nadhmi auchi
4259612 overlooked rezkos questionable activities to take money not just to finance his campaigns but to buy the mansion he feels his family deserves
4259613 if he sticks to the issues mccain will defeat barack obama
4259614 video clips that show his saying he wants to reduce the military
4259615 america seeks a world in which there are no nuclear weapons
4259616 he gave his famous antiwar speech in october 2002 but didnt officially declare his candidacy for the u
4259617 obama has consistently refused to support legislation that would define an infant who survives a late term induced labor abortion as a human being with the right to live
4259618 he insists that no restriction must ever be placed on the right of a mother to decide to abort her child
4259619 obama on the floor of the illinois state senate said that woman had an absolute right to abortion to kill the baby even if it survived that abortion
4259620 the government ends up collecting less capital gains tax revenue not more

4259632 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4259633 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4259634 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4259635 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4259636 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4259637 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party

4259651 ha sido un partido dif cil para nosotros su defensa nos ha sorprendido
4259652 en croacia ning n resultado me sorprender a la eliminatoria est abierta es evidente que all van a tener que atacar m s y que vamos a tener m s espacios nosotros en quince d as vamos a estar un poquito m s frescos tambi n y el problema es el ambiente que podemos tener all y que ganar fuera de casa siempre es complicado
4259653 ha sido un partido dif cil para nosotros ellos han defendido muy bien con marcajes al hombre no han dejado espacios y ah se ha notado la falta de frescura nuestra esperaba m s o menos lo que vi pero aqu ya no se practica el marcaje al hombre y eso s que nos ha sorprendido
4259654 tengo que estar contento con lo que hemos conseguido aunque el deseo principal era poner en marcha un juego m s fuerte y potente del que se ha demostrado es un resultado que nos abre posibilidades
4259655 el deportivo es favorito para el pr ximo partido tiene m s experiencia que los nuestros con los jugadores nuevos no hemos tenido suficiente tiempo para componer el juego pero la ventaja es que jugamos en nuestra casa con nuestra afici n y haremos lo posible para que el d por salga de la uefa

4259659 this will make any hope of cooperative effort on iran much more difficult
4259660 the one place of high to the united states where russia plays a direct role in what we are trying to do in that sense it towers over all these other things
4259661 this has come at a very opportune time for iran
4259662 any new rift between the us and russians would be welcome by iran anything that give iran more time and a little more headache for the us
4259663 up to a point iran would be quietly happy but the conflict can escalate to something that would cause more instability and suffering
4259664 im amazed by their skills at seeing black as white of portraying aggressors as victims
4259665 some of our partners far from assisting us are attempting to impede us by transferring georgian troops on board us aircraft directly to the conflict zone
4259666 georgia is a marginal issue to the united states iran is a central issue
4259667 seriously limit its response to georgia to avoid a russian counter in iran
4259668 even if there are no more un sanctions on iran at least there can still be more us and european sanctions
4259669 nuclear and missile entities used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
4259670 i think russia has been playing us when it comes to sanctions and stringing it out for years and years
4259671 theyve never wanted sanctions and our position has moved to theirs not vice versa if you go back 12 years ago we were debating whether there should be a nuclear reactor now we are well beyond that today
4259672 it seems to be overshadowing the iran nuclear issue at least for some time
4259673 it makes it more difficult at the un and the p5 permanent five members of the

4259678 cette discipline japonaise nest pas un sport mais un ensemble de formes de simulacres de conflits visant domestiquer la violence ses adeptes sont plus nombreux en france quau japon
4259679 cest lune de ces disciplines japonaises qui comme les arrangements floraux ou la c r monie du th projettent travers un support ici le corps un id al de puret

4259709 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
4259710 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
4259711 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4259712 if i were to return my iphone now i would wait until february 2009 to buy it again after next month apple needs to ramp up for year end holiday sales there is no window of time available to redesign the 3g circuitry replace all the existing 3g iphones and build up adequate inventories for the holidays holiday sales are too valuable to risk an inventory shortage if a recall is advised i expect that it wont be issued until 2009
4259713 this is definitely going to be a wait and see
4259714 they say a fix is on the way but lets see if the fix works
4259715 i still love her im not really over her yet we still hang she was just out with me a couple days ago and we were having a great time shes really got it i think shes great

4259717 im not making my daughter do anything she doesnt want to do
4259718 perhaps we were a bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse
4259719 in the first half we had too many unforced errors we needed to be more dynamic show more personality and to try to drive the play
4259720 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4259721 we had to believe that we could get a result we had to match the effort and tonight it was enough
4259722 i think at the start of the match they didnt expect us to come out and take it to them with the energy and effort that we showed
4259723 we expected them to come back at out ground and not underestimate but well have out fans behind us and we believe we can do it
4259724 this is the week where it goes from summer season to sport season so every condo and house out here probably drops by about a 1 000

4259726 i dont know if funding the beaches is really a drop in the bucket of addressing the issues that face our economy

4259728 i stood at the doctors side and watched him perform a partial birth abortion on a woman who was six months pregnant the babys heartbeat was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen the doctor delivered the babys body and arms everything but his little head the babys body was moving his little fingers were clasping together he was kicking his feet the doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the babys head and the babys arms jerked out in a flinch a startle reaction like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall then the doctor opened the scissors up then he stuck the high powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the babys brains out now the baby was completely limp i never went back to the clinic but i am still haunted by the face of that little boy it was the most perfect angelic face i have ever seen

4259737 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh

4259749 gis datasets are growing increasingly complex often involving many gigabytes of interactive maps we are under pressure to deliver products capable of crunching through these datasets fast efficiently and accurately
4259750 with the cuda configuration calculations that previously took 20 minutes to complete are now done in 30 seconds moreover calculations that previously took 30 to 40 seconds are now real time it is no exaggeration to say that at least for our industry nvidia cuda technology could be the most revolutionary development in computing since the invention of the microprocessor
4259751 manifold is the first gis to exploit massively parallel supercomputer technology on a desktop using inexpensive plug in cards that provide hundreds of processors for less than 500 that enables gis tasks and analysis to be completed hundreds of times faster than before through an innovative use of inexpensive consumer hardware
4259752 mr huang mr liu and mr zhao and have served our company for a long time and we have benefited from their expertise in technology corporate operations administration and management
4259753 as members of our management team they will assist us with the management of more than 700 employees a radical increase from approximately 100 employees in 2006 we are confident that their expertise will ensure efficiency in running our organization as well as in the delivery of solutions to clients
4259754 the implementation of a new gis is the result of a lamp local authority modernisation programme project that the council undertook with the aim of improving services delivery through the increased use of electronic methods
4259755 this highlighted the need for us to replace our existing gis software the choice of cadcorp sis on the desktop and geognosis as our new web enabled gis was made on the grounds of the softwares ease of use its value for money and the fact that it delivers all the functionality we require both now and in the future
4259756 among the benefits we expect from the new gis are improved working methods the ability for council staff and citizens to access information more readily and to use it more effectively with speedier analysis and return of land charges and other information searches
