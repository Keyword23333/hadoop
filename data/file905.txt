9050011 we are on a path toward a much weaker economic situation than we saw in the second quarter and we have to grapple in the next few months with whether this dark period is priced into the market or not and the payroll report in particular will test whether that dark period is priced in
9050012 the market is expecting down 70 000 i think it could be more than 100 000 down because the weekly claims figure is suggesting 100 000 to 150 000 down

9050045 they thought the library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books which was true enough but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library

9050057 we have technology now to allow us to globally assess what igf is doing in breast cancer at the whole gene expression level
9050058 this is one of the first studies to do that we know that igf is bad in cancer but now we can globally understand it in a more comprehensive manner it could lead to finding biomarkers for patients response
9050059 we found that igf i is a major regulator of cell growth and cell survival
9050060 if you have something regulating dna repair you want that turned off
9050061 once patients are resistant to hormone treatment as with tamoxifen their treatment options are limited a treatment that inhibited receptors for igf might give them another option

9050095 an eco congregation is one that takes seriously gods imperative to look after the world and all that is within in
9050096 so its based on our understanding of genesis chapter one where god created the world and entrusted it to our care
9050097 and that includes not just human beings but all living creatures and everything within the eco system
9050098 its about an awareness of how the choices that we make in terms of our daily lifestyle can directly affect the world in which we live
9050099 you cant give him time to make a lot of decisions because hes proven that hes a very capable quarterback
9050100 hes proven that hes good so if you give him more time well improve his odds of being good in this game
9050101 we had heard of them but we had no idea going into the game that they would be that good up front
9050102 they were constantly in our faces we had a bunch of offensive linemen who had never played before and they just controlled the interior they made life very difficult for us
9050103 since the defensive front ought to be one of our strengths i would hope that we could have a decent pass rush with four down linemen
9050104 then we can mix in pressures when necessary and try to keep them off balance
9050105 it solves a lot of issues if we can get pressure with our front four
9050106 we know they have some new guys playing on the line
9050107 its the first game of the season theyre probably not going to be in sync right off the bat so its important to come out and not let them get into a rhythm we want to throw their timing off
9050108 you start looking at the line and looking for the rush instead of looking downfield and that just throws your timing off you become tentative and it throws off your mechanics you dont step into your throws and you dont have any confidence in your throws
9050109 we are fully prepared to assist the state of texas and those impacted by hurricane gustav

9050128 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9050129 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9050130 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9050131 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9050132 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9050133 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9050134 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9050135 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9050136 the clock is running make the most of today time waits for no man yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift thats why it is called the present

9050149 i hope that this action will act as a wake up call
9050150 the cyclone will have more than 24 hours over the very warm waters of the northwestern caribbean so strengthening seems imminent and could even be rapid
9050151 the water is rising fast and there is widespread looting down here
9050152 the people are even stripping the material from one of the bridges it is awful
9050153 i think were going to get more than what most people expect
9050154 a lot of people come forward with feelings of guilt and shame but my experience generally is its not that common
9050155 it was not committed anywhere in public view and it was committed in an area with little or no public access i dont expect thered be any outside witnesses
9050156 then that stigma walks around with them when they try to access services and people think about them as criminals and dont treat them as well it snowballs
9050157 its a fascinating social commentary about how stigma can stop people from seeking help

9050232 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9050233 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9050234 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9050235 it turns out the women of america arent done yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling after all
9050236 when you get to know her youll be as impressed as i am
9050237 along with fellow reformers in the great state of alaska as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual to the special interests to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good old boy network
9050238 my agenda was to stop wasteful spending and cut property taxes and put the people first
9050239 when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offender to account
9050240 its always safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo but i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things
9050241 and this is a moment when principle and political independence matter a lot more than just the party line and this is a man who has always been there to serve his country not just his party this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president and my running mate is a man who has shown those qualities in the darkest of places and in the service of his country
9050242 i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
9050243 put this in the mtv news headline fat joe says daddy yankee is a sellout
9050244 just like that i gotta go in im talking to little cousins that like yankee and all that and theyre starting to believe that john mccain is the best candidate i cant have that
9050245 i opened the newspaper and got sick to my stomach
9050246 i felt like i wanted to vomit when i seen that the reason why i called him a sellout is because i feel he did that for a publicity look rather than the issues that are affecting his people that look up to him how could you want john mccain in office when george bush and the republicans already have half a million people losing their homes in foreclosure were fighting an unjust war its the latinos and black kids up in the frontlines fighting that war we over here trying to take the troops out of iraq and bring peace this guy immediately wants war if not with iraq or afghanistan hell start a new one with iran i feel real disgusted that daddy yankee would do that either he did that for a look or hes just not educated on politics
9050247 if he believes john mccain is the better candidate for the latinos
9050248 we could sit down even if he wants to get into a debate we can debate anywhere new york puerto rico
9050249 like i said with me my whole philosophy on blacks and latinos is were all one
9050250 were in the same ghettos same inner cities and were suffering from the same problems every problem the blacks have the latinos have theres two systems of health care the one for the rich thats really good then theres the one for the inner city where they leave ladies in the emergency room unattended for 24 hours until they drop dead people dont even check on her hours after shes dead this is normal stuff this is whats happening in the u s
9050251 my own sister to me she was murdered by doctors
9050252 she was having a baby in the bronx and they gave her an epidural a normal procedure that was supposed to numb her from the waist down they numbed her from the waist up because they had amateurs learning in the bronx hospitals not even real doctors students murdered my sister in the inner city in the bronx i love what barack is doing with the heath care system once he gets universal health care for everybody then we gotta step up our system to make it the best in the world
9050253 im a huge fan of the clintons i love hillary i love bill they hit home runs out the park i was so excited when bill was speaking it reminded me of why i love him hes articulate so smart greatest president of our era when he was here we had peace yasser arafat of palestine and the prime minister of israel shaking hands and hugging bringing peace in the middle east not war everybody had jobs the economy was growing george bush and the republicans turned the whole country around to where our dollar is worth half the euro dollar your man john mccain wants to continue the same tactics of the bush organization why should my man daddy yankee be endorsing mccain this is the only urban guy in the universe to endorse john mccain you got people who look up to yankee young teenagers that look up to him and might make the wrong choice john mccain is the wrong thing to do i dont think the republicans care much about minorities i cant believe yankee went and endorsed this guy
9050254 i travel the world doing shows and people hate the united states because of the policies of george bush
9050255 years ago you would go overseas and the people would praise you and love the united states i feel barack obama is the one person who could bring not just the united states but the world together i was in africa two days ago and i seen people with i love obama on their bumper sticker he just spoke to 200 000 people in germany
9050256 we have to vote and change this country around everybody has to get out there and register im not asking im telling you to go vote im forcing you
9050257 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
9050258 thats the promise we need to keep thats the change we need right now
9050259 i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million per year
9050260 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9050261 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9050262 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9050263 america is sinking and hes going to be the one that lifts us back up
9050264 and were worth that ultimately this isnt about barack it is so much about our future and what were going to do im so impassioned right now he really is for the people and thats why people are feeling so excited ive never been so excited about a candidate before
9050265 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to hope that we confess
9050266 from martin luther kings speech to where we are now who would have ever thought that a person of color would be sitting at the doorsteps of the white house to become president of the united states
9050267 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
9050268 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again
9050269 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension
9050270 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the cameraman at x17
9050271 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
9050272 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
9050273 the response by samantha and lindsay regarding what i said is absolutely ridiculous when i first spoke to x17 i clearly started that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina i have taped recordings texts and the corroboration from lawyers and authorities to prove it
9050274 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
9050275 now i dont believe that doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9050276 ive known bob rumson for years and id been operating under the assumption that the reason bob devotes so much time and energy shouting at the rain was that he simply didnt get it well i was wrong bobs problem isnt that he doesnt get it bobs problem is that he cant sell it
9050277 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9050278 weve got serious problems and we need serious people and if you want to talk about character bob you better come at me with more than a burning flag and a membership card if you want to talk about character and american values fine just tell me where and when and ill show up
9050279 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
9050280 we have serious problems to solve and we need serious people to solve them
9050281 thank you god bless you and god bless the united states of america
9050282 my name is andrew shepherd and i am the president
9050283 he said all the right things about resource development in alaska
9050284 i didnt have an opportunity to speak to all the candidates but again its not my job to speak to all the candidates and tell americans who to vote for thats americans jobs to figure out what candidates are standing for thats the voters jobs
9050285 i talk about involvement by americans having a say in where the nation is going to go
9050286 this is an exciting day and for alaska you know i hope we register on somebodys radar screen
9050287 we have so much oil we are just sitting on
9050288 we would be less reliant on foreign sources of energy if we utilized that we need to have the ability to tap into it and produce for rest of the united states
9050289 and i hate saying that but what i mean is like madonna she can be hanging out and laughing and then you put the camera on her and its like holy sh
9050290 it was the hardest video ive ever edited because every moment was great
9050291 every moment that she was on camera she was amazing shes got an incredible quality about her she
9050292 she came out in these high heel boots and i was going to say something to her about them
9050293 but on her own she was like id feel better in sneakers her instincts are great she has great charisma and personality
9050294 she started showing me all of her personal items from under her bed that her ex boyfriend gave her so she pulled out his dirty socks and a bunch of photographs
9050295 the necklace shes wearing in the video is the necklace he gave her
9050296 she was very down to earth and its kind of very popular for little girls in the entertainment industry to be kind of bratty
9050297 i couldnt believe how many people wanted to visit the video set and ive worked with people like mariah and madonna she was very gracious and shes very smart she really knows her stuff look whether she wins or not i think shell make a great transition from being a teen star shes very conscientious of her persona and of the crossover
9050298 you can tell by the lyrics that theyre very personal and thats how shell make that transition the stuff she talks about in the video is clever and emotional and fun at the same time you can be 18 and enjoy it too
9050299 well people have different ideas about what truly constitutes metal so maybe there was some confusion
9050300 metal isnt all i listen to of course but there was a period of time where it was
9050301 i guess it started in school i started listening to stuff with screaming in it and then i started exploring more metal myspace helped me a lot and friends will tell me about certain bands and some of the bands i like arent necessarily
9050302 i love the devil wears prada theyre more hardcore but theyre awesome
9050303 and job for a cowboy is another band i love
9050304 youve got vocals that i cant do the double bass drums the incredible guitar solos every part of the band does more difficult stuff than your average rock band does i listen to these bands and i wish i could do all of that but i cant
9050305 i was the little girl in the red dress and red lipstick and i totally didnt fit in but i had so much fun
9050306 it was awesome i lost my shoes i was going crazy it was awesome
9050307 i would love to secretly do some work on a metal bands album
9050308 i wish i could just secretly do vocals and nobody would know its me
9050309 one time they were actually listening to metal and i was like what are you guys doing listening to metal
9050310 they took a lot of their stage ideas from metal bands from like europe and they use a lot of pyro and stuff like that but they like metal they dont listen to death metal but theyre definitely not opposed to it which i think is really cool it shows that theyre not just some pop band
9050311 even more amped to be able to start playing shows and work on our new material
9050312 i need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9050313 its about you change doesnt come from washington it comes to washington
9050314 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
9050315 im heartless and iced out see i have an icebox where my heart used to be
9050316 i dont think the cost of gas kept people from coming down but maybe once they got here they just spent their monies a little more wisely and thriftly
9050317 in august when the gas prices started to decline we did see our business pick up
9050318 we try to bring in as much extra merchandise as we can and well have more of our staff come in
9050319 weve doubled up on our staff weve ordered some more food so we make sure we have everything that our customers would like and were just ready and awaiting with smiles
9050320 when we see someone smoking on campus we will inform them politely that its a smoke free campus and well give them a coupon for a free nicotine replace product
9050321 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
9050322 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
9050323 im heartless and iced out see i have an icebox where my heart used to be
9050324 im heartless and iced out see i have an icebox where my heart used to be
9050325 im heartless and iced out see i have an icebox where my heart used to be
9050326 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
9050327 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
9050328 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
9050329 this is an important time in the life of many who are entering the halls of lakehead university lusu is primarily responsible for not only standing up for students but also to make sure their times and years are enriched while theyre here
9050330 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9050331 weve got our work cut out this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation
9050332 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9050333 eles n o tinham alvo atiravam para um lado e para o outro atingindo quem estivesse no meio da rua
9050334 if john mccain doesnt select a woman for his vp hes dumber than i thought
9050335 of course i cant walk a straight line i cant even zip a straight line with my volcom breaker jacket
9050336 in a loft that was a converted ice factory it had 40 foot ceilings it was gorgeous
9050337 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9050338 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9050339 the truth is i was between roles just being lazy and letting it grow out when i came onto this project both stephen and david wanted me to keep it long i think it really suits jerry david told me he really did go to trial with long hair so its not out of the realm of possibility
9050340 arc90 is the first place ive worked where company politics played little to no role in the architecting of software
9050341 crm is no longer just a model for managing customers but one of customer engagement
9050342 it seems like the visual deterrents work but eventually the sea lions get smart and they realize they can bust through them
9050343 you cant harm them in any way but taking a hose to them and scaring them off is easily done
9050344 they are going to be around the harbor whether we like it or not
9050345 i do sympathize with the homeowners it would be just like living next to a dog pound and hearing the barking
9050346 having lived on the bay for 35 years i can say its a noisy place you have barking sea lions fog horns squeaky docks music late night party boats etc etc i was always able to either enjoy those special sounds or tune it out
9050347 complaining of harbor noise is like buying a home on the freeway and complaining about the cars or buying under an airport and complaining about planes give me a break
9050348 were not trying to put a man on the moon here we just need some workable solutions
9050349 i am really disturbed by these allegations she never had a fever she never had anything wrong with her she was just unhappy after she detoxed
9050350 we hope the government will be less inclined to prosecute american muslim nonprofits and mosques for supporting terrorist causes if they demonstrate that they meet the highest standards of legal compliance financial accountability and good governance
9050351 useful first step toward keeping muslim charities from being shut down
9050352 fundamental change requires a change in the governments basic approach to interpreting the law
9050353 in order to preserve the rights of all nonprofit organizations and indeed the rights of all people all levels of government must conduct their counterterrorism activities in a way that consistently protects liberty and civil society otherwise americans and others lose safeguards that were designed to protect us all from creeping tyranny
9050354 constraining the critical activities of the charitable and philanthropic sectors stifling free speech and ultimately impeding the fight against terrorism
9050355 u s counterterrorism laws have made it increasingly difficult for u s based organizations to operate overseas for example after the 2004 tsunami u s organizations operating in areas controlled by the tamil tigers a designated terrorist organization risked violating prohibitions against material support when creating displaced persons camps and hospitals traveling or distributing food and water
9050356 conduits for terrorist funding and a breeding ground for aggressive dissent
9050357 congress has not utilized its oversight powers to review counterterrorism programs
9050358 operates in fear of what may spark the government to use its power to shut them down
9050359 i dont think there should be special rules governing not for profits that support muslim causes this has evolved into a bizarre regulatory regime that is unduly discriminatory

9050363 one of the best things i could do for nine tenths of the people i knew was to give them something that would make them forget home and all it stood for for a few blessed moments at least
9050364 i dont think so especially because her sister was going to give birth next month
9050365 i dont think it was racing if anything it was the other two cars and they got in the middle of it
9050366 there is no evidence that the involved persons or vehicles were engaged in an organized speed competition
9050367 by which i mean there are lots of random blog posters on places like gamespot or neogaf or whatever who show a clearer understanding of the game than people who are all
9050368 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9050369 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9050370 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9050371 unfortunately in most cases this is simply not true most of the english people here are living on very tight budgets
9050372 if i tried to ride in on a motorcycle id probably e

9050430 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9050431 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9050432 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9050433 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9050434 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9050435 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9050436 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9050437 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9050440 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
9050441 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9050442 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9050443 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9050444 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9050445 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
9050446 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
9050447 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches

9050449 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
9050450 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

9050454 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9050455 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9050456 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9050457 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9050458 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9050465 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
9050466 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9050467 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
9050468 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
9050469 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
9050470 one of the most reliable sources of scathing rebuttal to the left wing media has become known for its humorous but biting style his regular verbal assault on labour ministers has quite a reputation
9050471 we like mr eugenides we highly recommend adding him to your blogroll go and read it is absolutely the most glorious stuff
9050472 oh boy i think reading you and devils kitchen is going to damage my psyche what a joy

9050476 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
9050477 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise

9050484 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
9050485 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad
9050486 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9050487 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9050488 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9050489 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9050490 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9050491 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9050492 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9050493 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9050494 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9050495 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui

9050499 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9050500 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9050501 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9050502 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
9050503 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
9050504 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9050505 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9050506 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9050507 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9050508 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
9050509 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

9050515 there is strong clinical evidence that screening improves the early detection of bowel cancer by 56 per cent compared to those not screened and is 160 per cent more likely to detect pre cancerous polyps that can become cancer if not treated in time
9050516 we found that after ten years of a population screening program the treatment of bowel cancer would cost on average 191 3 million per year marginally higher than the 189 6 million predicted treatment costs if people aged 50 74 years were not screened
9050517 early detection through screening would enable more treatment of early stage bowel cancers and give more patients a better opportunity to survive and potentially return to normal productive lives
9050518 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9050519 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9050520 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9050521 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9050522 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9050523 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9050524 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9050525 it will pick up again if we dont diminish the product so much that they dont rebound
9050526 moreover these women are more likely to interact socially with women who are less inclined to breastfeed such as those who are younger less educated overweight obese or smokers
9050527 new mothers need support from their families communities and workplaces in order to breastfeed
9050528 they need baby friendly accredited maternity hospitals increased breastfeeding help in the community and paid maternity leave not simply another government campaign extolling the virtues of breastfeeding
9050529 the dmca was intended to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce not squelch it
9050530 the court finds no reasonable juror could conclude that a comprehensive review of every file would be feasible
9050531 the decision rendered here is confined to the particular combination of facts in this case and is not intended to push the bounds of the safe harbor so wide that less than scrupulous service providers may claim its protection
9050532 we are very happy that the judge in this case recognized our compliance with the dmca and our efforts to respect copyrights
9050533 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
9050534 i am thinking about buying an iphone but i have been hearing reports about its unreliability should i be worried should i wait for the problems to be fixed before i purchase an iphone should i not get an iphone at all
9050535 i like the iphone for its touch screen interface and for the fact that i can combine my ipod and my mobile phone into one device i even like that i can use an app like maps occasionally but thats it mainly i want a mobile phone that i can depend on for making and receiving calls without having to jump through hoops or read hundreds of pages of documentation

9050543 the team at ciao has built a passionate consumer community based on intuitive technology and extensive merchant relationships that we believe will deliver incremental benefit to the microsoft live search platform
9050544 acquiring one of europes leading price comparison shopping and consumer reviews sites will further extend microsofts search and e commerce services in europe
9050545 we think the greenfield purchase would strengthen microsofts online platform and is consistent with strategy of simplifying tasks related to online transactions
9050546 we see long term benefits of increased investment but project losses in microsofts online service business for next couple of years

9050556 our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9050557 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba

9050561 with the storm hitting the shoreline of our country the focus will not be on the convention
9050562 i think its making everybody real apprehensive just the unknown factor
9050563 and the convention will actually be started by the time it hits so were going to be in the swing of things and its going to be hitting because you dont know anything until it hits
9050564 its still kind of a ways out where the landfall is going to be
9050565 but i cant be in minneapolis and my district takes a direct hit thats the decision i have to make
9050566 i think you get more out of that than going through with the convention
9050567 with the storm hitting the shoreline of our country the focus will not be on the convention i think mccain would get a lot of mileage out of that but im not the decision maker you know

9050569 there are also disadvantages to using the set and configfile options for example the execute package task does not have a similar feature that reproduces their behavior therefore if you have a solution that uses parent and child packages you will probably find that you need to make use of parent package configurations
9050570 if you need to make the logging connection manager configurable at run time you must avoid using parent package variables
9050571 it would be difficult for me to agree any more with this suggestion the lack of reuse in ssis is a major barrier to productivity and usability and is likely a major barrier to product adoption as well
9050572 in the past these may have been viewed as victimless crimes

9050580 investor confidence which had been boosted by the countrys return to democracy late last year has been further shaken by the protests
9050581 the political crisis compounds the fears triggered by high inflation and global economic uncertainty

9050617 hey there just wanted to start out by saying that it was a great article but there was one thing that i thought might deserve some comment and correction towards the status of female orcs in the horde during the time of mannoroth and the opening of the dark portal
9050618 you guys already did an interesting article about this i think it was a
9050619 i am an officer and current raid leader of a 25 man casual raiding guild
9050620 when we have 25 people on and ready we crush content
9050621 we are making the transition to 10 man raiding for
9050622 for those of you that have lead a guild or have just been an active officer you know how difficult it is to maintain a content crushing guild
9050623 if you are running a 10 man guild in wotlk youll be able to have more than one raiding main i have three toons that i plan to run through all the 10 man content its going to be so much fun to explore a lot of the content in a lot of different ways

9050846 sarah palin is a strong vice presidential pick that represents a fresh breath of air for those looking for representation in this election and someone who will make a difference in washington dc as a soon to be mom myself i admire what sarah palin has been able to achieve as both a professional executive rising to the level of governor as well as being a mom of five children with three daughters one son off to iraq in only a few weeks and a baby boy with the challenges of downs syndrome she has been a successful manager both of a state and her family one of the issues important to me is the pain we all face at the pump there is no one that knows the issue of rising oil prices and how we can solve this problem better than someone who knows alaska and its issues like sarah palin lastly i cant stop thinking of the irony that hillary clinton was able to get so many women excited about politics and what a woman could do but it is the republican party not the democrat party that is leading the way and elevating a smart and qualified woman like sarah palin to its 2008 ticket to win the white house i feel confident that governor palin should be able to carry on the mantle left to her by geraldine ferraros 1984 run connect with women as a new and refreshing face and close the deal to help us win in 2008 as a young professional and mom to be i am looking forward to campaigning for the mccain palin ticket

9050894 but the bottom line is she doesnt have a whole lot of experience she just doesnt
9050895 i wonder if her youth will accentuate mccains age over time in a bad way
9050896 it hurts the experience edge and the hard abortion stuff scares moderate swing voters
9050897 it will appeal to some bubbas but thats not enough
9050898 after his attacks on obamas readiness for the job itll be amusing to hear a 72 year old with a history of health problems justify this decision
9050899 shes a talent but thats the end of the experience

9050911 this is clearly an injustice against the victim the and all afghan women
9050912 such injustice can only promote a culture of impunity for violence perpetrated against women
9050913 achievement depends less on ability in doing research than on the courage to go after opportunity

9050927 i find it rather troubling that sarah palin would walk away from a four month child with down syndrome to chase her political ambitions
9050928 stop wasteful spending and cut property taxes and put the people first
9050929 i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9050930 the quarterback position i think the skys the limit for any player relative to the choices and decision that me makes the changes that he makes psychologically and mentally and his approach to the game
9050931 there are a lot of guys who have the physical ability to do it but they have to go out on the field to prove that they can be a consistent efficient effective performer by making good choices and decision about what they do and how they make those business like decision so they can perform better eliminate the bad plays and make more good plays
9050932 we didnt see this comming it was too unexpected we were being told for weeks that we would be hit with hurricane mitt and we were prepping for that storm
9050933 educated enough to not leave the house until the card is in order
9050934 youre getting down to people that are just hard core disengaged
9050935 if you get these voters on the rolls the question is how many of them are likely voters
9050936 its hard to send a letter to people whose addresses dont exist in the parish
9050937 i have one lady i have five applications on her
9050938 a lot of people well receive the application and then well receive another one with the same name but one day off on their birthday or one digit off on their social security number
9050939 and i can tell you im only one of those
9050940 they flattered me by making me younger i did appreciate that
9050941 the means of struggle need to change they need to shift from workplace collective organisation to district collective organisation
9050942 perform significant welfare and education functions rather than simply being an instrument of collective bargaining on wages and conditions
9050943 means and ends are mutually dependent they constantly influence each other the means are in fact a partial implementation of the end whereas the end becomes modified by the means adopted
9050944 workers councils and similar forms have appeared in many strike waves and revolutionary crises since 1917 in none have these forms been able to offer an alternative centre of authority an alternative decision making mechanism for the whole society this role is unavoidably played by a government either based on the existing military bureaucratic state core or on the existing organs of the workers movement
9050945 to lay its hands collectively on the means of production
9050946 this does not mean state ownership of the means of production which is merely a legal form without democratic republicanism the legal form of state ownership means private ownership by state bureaucrats
9050947 the working class in the course of its development will substitute for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and their antagonism and there will be no more political power properly so called since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism in civil society it is only in an order of things in which there are no more classes that social evolutions will cease to be political revolutions
9050948 all france organised into self working and self governing communes the suffrage for the national representation not a matter of sleight of hand for an all powerful government but the deliberate expression of organised communes the state functions reduced to a few functions for general national purposes
9050949 such is the commune the political form of the social emancipation of the liberation of labour from the usurpations slave holding of the monopolists of the means of labour created by the labourers themselves or forming the gift of nature as the state machinery and parliamentarism are not the real life of the ruling classes but only the organised general organs of their dominion so the commune is not the social movement of the working class and therefore of a general regeneration of mankind but the organised means of action
9050950 there are about 40 million germans does this mean that all 40 million will be members of the government
9050951 certainly for the system starts with the self government of the communities when class rule has disappeared there will be no state in the present political sense
9050952 you really should bring a graham cracker in for her to eat next time bananas are sold by the pound and you arent supposed to eat them until they are weighed

9050954 and youre east of east st louis and the wind is making speeches and the rain sounds like a round of applause
9050955 hang in there baby hes not the loser that everyone is telling you that he is if you wait and keep your mouth shut and call at exactly the right time and anticipate his moods and have no expectations about communication or your own sexual needs you can have him

9050988 last nights ecw had some of their best wrestlers compete in championship scramble qualifying matches and here is how it all went down
9050989 matt hardy who on two separate occasions was screwed out of winning the ecw championship took on a former ecw champion in john morrison hardy had morrison pushed to the limit in this match that was going back and forth there was a series of near pinfalls from both morrison and hardy but just when morrison tried to hit hardy with his signature move the moonlight drive hardy puts a stop to it and gives the tuesday night delight a hard hitting twist of fate giving him the win and a place in the ecw championship scramble match at unforgiven i just hope that the 3rd time will be a charm for matt hardy
9050990 morrisons partner the miz was involved in a championship scramble match as well against the high flying undefeated evan bourne who has never been pinned since being in the wwe
9050991 the third qualifying match was between two former ecw champions tommy dreamer and chavo guererro both veterans knew going into this match that a championship opportunity does not come often dreamer had things going in his favor but thanks to a distraction from chavos bodyguard bam neely the self proclaimed mexican warrior attacked him from behind and nailed him with a frog splash off the top rope giving him the win and a place in the championship scramble it looks like to me that chavo guererro is back on the winning track
9050992 last friday night on smackdown finlay was involved in a wwe championship scramble qualifying match against the united states champion shelton benjamin benjamin won that match thanks to the interference of mike knox last night on ecw finlay was given a second chance when he faced mike knox in the final ecw championship scramble qualifying match these two were at odds for weeks making this match a pure brawl towards the end of the match finlays son hornswoggle handed his father a shillelagh in order to clobber knox with it knox nailed finlay with a kick to the gut and was prevented from being clobbered even though the referee took the shillelagh from finlay hornswoggle handed him a second one but this time he was able to knock knox out and get the win giving him the final spot in the ecw championship scramble match at unforgiven we now know that it will be mark henry vs matt hardy vs the miz vs chavo guererro vs finlay for the ecw championship at unforgiven

9050998 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick

9051001 with his speech in denver barack obama made a compelling case for why he is the only choice for working families in this years election
9051002 here in michigan we have been battered by the bush mccain policy of rewarding companies that ship jobs overseas and providing tax cuts for the wealthy while working families struggle to pay their bills and put gas in their car but senator obama made it clear that as president his priority will be rebuilding the american economy so that it works for everyone not just the wealthy and while john mccain doesnt get it barack obama understands the importance of rebuilding the domestic automotive industry senator obama is committed to making sure that american auto manufacturers lead the way in developing alternative fuel vehicles while creating jobs in the process and in michigan that will be a welcome change from the bush mccain philosophy of telling americans that when it comes to the problems of job losses home foreclosures the loss of health care and so many other important issues your on your own
9051003 he did a wonderful job he was superb he addressed all the economic issues that are important in this years election and laid out a detail specific plan on how he was going to resolve those issues
9051004 i was pleased to hear senator obama say that even on the issues where we disagree we can do so without questioning the patriotism of those we disagree with
9051005 he senator obama did a great job not only did he make history but he showed america why he is the best choice to rebuild our economy and restore our standing in the world i think senator obamas commitment to making sure that every american has health care and retirement security will provide americans with a clear contrast to john mccains desire to tax health care benefits and invest peoples retirement savings in the stock market
9051006 working at a va hospital our members have a particular interest in veterans affairs issues and senator obamas support for americas veterans is solid and unwavering
9051007 i was really pleased to hear senator obama say that everyman is better off when we work together towards the common goal of providing everyone with the dignity that comes from employment
9051008 senator obamas statement that our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work is reflective of his support for the employee free choice act and his willingness to create a national labor relations board that will respect the rights of workers to organize in the workplace
9051009 barack obama has been criticized for not offering enough specifics in his speeches but tonight he put to rest any suggestion that he was offering glowing rhetoric with no policy specifics

9051011 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
9051012 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s

9051014 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
9051015 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim

9051017 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
9051018 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
9051019 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
9051020 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
9051021 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
9051022 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
9051023 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
9051024 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
9051025 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
9051026 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

9051041 the pilot program which will cost 400 000 and was not publicly announced is already inciting outrage among some educators and advocates who worry that mayor michael r bloombergs efforts to overhaul the school system have been overly focused on standardized testing no child left behind law has required schools nationwide to administer tests starting in the third grade since 2002 mr bloomberg has gone further using test scores to determine school grades as well as bonuses for teachers and principals the administration has also expressed interest in using test scores to determine teacher tenure an idea that is being blocked by legislators in albany
9051042 oh well its past what they claim is their warranty theyll never do anything about it
9051043 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
9051044 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies

9051101 vancouver needs a solid and well communicated emergency preparedness plan that focuses not just on personal preparedness but on a well coordinated public response people need to know which public buildings are designated post event centres and what they can expect in the way of support should there be a large scale emergency
9051102 i wrote a report early in 2008 outlining the steady erosion of emergency preparedness and planning in vancouvers schools that report helped kickstart some preliminary steps toward improvements but there is still significant work to do to ensure our schools are prepared to respond effectively in emergency situations we need coordination funding commitments training and most of all leadership by working together and coordinating our work with city council and park board we can ensure were allocating our resources most effectively for the benefit of all vancouver residents
9051103 our plan really demonstrates a specific area for greater collaboration between city council the board of education and park board

9051116 ninety percent of the women we talked to said they would never cancel a childs doctors appointment for example but 80 percent would cancel their mammograms or dermatology appointments because they are time starved
9051117 we are a society of women that beats ourselves up with modern mothers goal to be selfless perfectionism rears its ugly head

9051152 automatizaron con unas m quinas muy costosas pero eso ha implicado retrasos para quienes trotan temprano y se van directo a sus trabajos
9051153 mucha gente no acata las normas y se mete por sitios que est n restringidos despu s de las 5 00 pm cuando se les advierte de su falta al reglamento son agresivos con el personal otro problema es que no denuncian los hechos no van a la fiscal a y no hay registro

9051170 i kind of expected mccains pick was not going to be something that was going to be the conventional pick knowing him the way i know him it was going to be an out of the box type of selection and this caught everybody by surprise
9051171 her name wasnt mentioned it came down to the tim pawlentys the mitt romneys but i think that whatever bounce the obama campaign gets and they will its going to be deflated quickly with sarah palin when shes introduced
9051172 last night senator barack obama had a chance to address all the sexism and misogyny that was leveled in this campaign against hillary clinton and he chose not to take that
9051173 so in terms of sitting well with women on the democratic side we see that john mccain gets it john mccain selected a qualified woman with a lot of experience and accomplishments to be his running mate as opposed to barack obama who chose against the person that got more votes than anyone in history so i think that thats actually whats sitting poorly with women right now
9051174 actually when you look at sarah palin you see that she is a family woman shes a mother of five you see that in alaska she has an incredibly strong record as a reformer
9051175 so i think thats where peoples concern is going to be that its a person with accomplishment and experience whos been chosen she just happens to be a woman as well
9051176 an industry has to have more than just one poster child to overhaul the system one day salesforce com will not deliver its growth projections and its stock price will tumble in a big hurry then the rest of the saas industry will collapse
9051177 we use salesforce com and i like it but i wouldve bought the product even if it wasnt saas the success of salesforce com in my opinion has to do with their product being good not because its saas
9051178 er ist jetzt stabil und es sieht nicht so dramatisch aus
9051179 in response to high oil and gas prices and in response to the resulting state government budget surplus palin proposed giving alaskans 100 a month energy debit cards she also proposed providing grants to electrical utilities so that they would reduce customers rates 34 she subsequently dropped the debit card proposal and in its place she proposed to send alaskans 1 200 directly and eliminate the gas tax
9051180 would you like to trust in jesus right now as your only hope of going to heaven and make sure your name is in the book on that day

9051196 i hope to get an artificial leg so i can have a chance at walking again

9051198 from there i had knee surgery dr greenwald operated on my other knee last january to april i played in
9051199 then this last go around i came home and i tried out for the san antonio silver stars
9051200 the team that i played with in the eurocup traveled to slovakia i played against lindsey wilson that was really interesting seeing a lot of eastern european countries last year alone i was in nine or 10 different countries either visiting or living
9051201 now ive had my time off which has been different but ive really enjoyed it im just staying at home here in would be a really cool opportunity ill be there until april 30 2009
9051202 i feel very fortunate because i know a lot of people in this world have never even left the
9051203 i just try to represent myself the best that i can and just enjoy everywhere i go some places are harder than other because of the language barrier they all spoke to you in french or german in my town in the scandinavian countries are very good at their english so there were times that i didnt even realize i was in another country when i was in it kind of just depends on where you are at is going to be very different with the language barrier and the culture its 98 percent muslim there ive really learned a lot about other cultures i would like to work and maybe even live overseas when i get done playing
9051204 when the coaches get upset or mad at the team and yell at the team they usually yell in the language they are best at sometimes it is nice being the american because you miss out on being yelled at you just kind of sit there because you cant really understand it but most of the time i have a translator as well one of my teammates would translate for me during huddles i usually look at my translator instead of my coach and they would just talk to me and fill me in on whats going on
9051205 its extremely different i felt disrespectful in a sense not looking people in the eye but overseas its not as big being out of the
9051206 i had to get used to the refereeing because it is really bad
9051207 ive had to adjust to the refereeing there is one rule where you cant step with your right foot with the ball in your right hand in
9051208 overseas you have to learn to motivate yourself it can be hard because maybe you dont feel like going to lift that day and when you dont have a consistent team its hard at
9051209 i would have to say that there are a couple of different games the
9051210 my senior year we faced a lot of adversity we didnt have the numbers because a lot of people were hurt i really learned a lot that year about pulling together my past teammates are still some of my best friends today i still talk to them all the time the relationships were probably the biggest part for me was very hard a lot of people didnt think we were all that good we really came together and we gave a good run but we ended up losing by four points its like coach fennelly always said youre not going to remember the scores or how many games you won but you are going to remember the relationships a lot of things he said back then are really true and have carried over i dont remember the scores of the games and how many points i had but a lot of my teammates are still my best friends
9051211 youll remember the relationships not the scores when you get frustrated with something you just need to figure it out he used to always say figure it out one thing hes always been very adamant about is showing a lot of class wherever you go even if you lose and even if you are the underdog you show respect to people you thank the janitors and the bus drivers and that has really carried over i grew up that way but just to have a coach that understands that its not about winning and losing all the time but respecting other people
9051212 his dad was an early reader and we know its so important tsou says
9051213 when you go home read more books to your babies and enjoy them rubio tells the parents
9051214 remember thats how they are going to learn to read listening to and watching you read
9051215 we know it builds neuropathways in an infants brain she says
9051216 they learn so much they are like little sponges when they are babies the more we can expose them to books literature language rhymes and rhythms the better off they will be when they start school
9051217 we got her a library card this summer fraser says
9051218 my parents read to me and told me how important it was to read to her
9051219 she loves to eat the books and she understands they are her books and they are different from the other toys
9051220 i hope it helps her learn to speak well and learn vocabulary words and go on and be a successful adult
9051221 the more books they can be exposed to the better says uzzelle a first grade teacher
9051222 i want reading to be part of our routine and for him to learn to love it
9051223 we read at home and its good for him to be here dad ali al nashash 46 says of the library
9051224 illiteracy costs us huge amounts of money in joblessness and incarceration she says
9051225 the child who goes to school never having seen a book or been read to will have a short attention span little vocabulary and very little desire to read rubio says

9051227 mccain has made a brilliant move here we do have a woman on the ticket but she is a republican woman its not hillary clinton sarah palin does not have to wear pantsuits and her husband is not a crook
9051228 governor sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energize social conservatives
9051229 she has a record of advancing the culture of life at every opportunity including championing a ban on partial birth abortion and promoting parental consent for minor abortions
9051230 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9051231 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9051232 i am really pleased to see that the mccain campaign has reached out to a woman
9051233 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9051234 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the supreme courts abortion rights ruling the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9051235 a cynical effort to appeal to disappointed hillary clinton voters and get them to vote ultimately against their own self interest
9051236 governor palin may be the second woman vice presidential candidate on a major party ticket but she is not the right woman sadly she is a woman who opposes womens rights just like john mccain
9051237 by picking palin we now risk having two anti choice extremists who will push a rigid anti choice agenda
9051238 they all love you but in about 90 days if you dont turn this thing around theyll have to fire you so if you dont go home tonight as if you were fired and come back on monday as if heidrick brought you in as a turnaround queen you arent going to make it but if you can take your 13 years of equity and relationships and still be as fresh as if they took you out and put you in a new company doing the tough stuff to your own people and your own strategies you can be one of the best leaders going forward thats the decision you have to make

9051243 the number of accidental gun deaths involving children 14 and younger has gone down precipitously in recent years
9051244 simply put the answer to gun violence in schools or society in general will not be found in the barrel of a gun
9051245 in any institution there has to be a final authority
9051246 someone who can make the final decisions and who can expect them to be obeyed
9051247 people have to know and have to understand the structure they are supposed to work in this sounds obvious but it is far too often violated in most institutions even in the military
9051248 it is a very old principle of human relations that no one should be put into a conflict of loyalties
9051249 and having more than one master creates such a conflict
9051250 there is no such thing as the one right organization
9051251 there are only organizations each of which has distinct strengths distinct limitations and specific applications it has become clear that organization is not an absolute it is a tool for making people productive in working together as such a given organization structure fits certain tasks in certain conditions and at certain times
9051252 institutions are homogenous and that therefore the entire enterprise should be organized the same way
9051253 but in any one enterprise there is need for a number of different organization structures coexisting side by side
9051254 unexpected failure should be taken as seriously as a 60 year old mans first minor heart attack
9051255 do not dismiss unexpected failure as the result of a subordinates incompetence or as an accident but treat it as a symptom of systems failure

9051285 what the heck they nascar dont get it they messed up the winston the all star race and theyre messing up the shootout
9051286 they ought to line us up make us run 10 laps they want us to run around there for 25 first and have a 25 lap segment thatd be cool but 10 laps to go all or nothing thats what the fans want thats what the drivers want
9051287 the last segment being 50 laps were just going to sit there for 30 i just dont get it they dont get it i dont understand i dont know what the focus group is theyre talking to to get these formats

9051295 lo que el productor ha dado a la sociedad es su cuota individual de trabajo as por ejemplo la jornada social de trabajo se compone de las horas de trabajo individual el tiempo individual de trabajo de cada productor por separado es parte de la jornada social de trabajo que l aporta su participaci n en ella la sociedad le entrega un bono consignando que ha rendido tal o cual cantidad de trabajo despu s de descontar lo que ha trabajado para el fondo com n y con este bono saca de los dep sitos sociales de bienes de consumo la parte equivalente a la cantidad de trabajo que rindi la misma cantidad de trabajo que ha dado a la sociedad bajo una forma la recibe de sta bajo otra distinta
9051296 aqu reina evidentemente el mismo principio que regula el intercambio de mercanc as por cuanto este es intercambio de equivalentes han variado la forma y el contenido porque bajo las nuevas condiciones nadie puede dar sino su trabajo y porque por otra parte ahora nada puede pasar a ser propiedad del individuo fuera de los medios individuales de consumo
9051297 pero en lo que se refiere a la distribuci n de estos medios de consumo entre los distintos productores rige el mismo principio que en el intercambio de mercanc as equivalentes se cambia una cantidad de trabajo bajo una forma por otra cantidad igual de trabajo bajo otra forma distinta
9051298 tal f rmula posibilita a su vez que se vayan modificando paulatinamente las leyes y categor as de la producci n mercantil como las leyes del valor y de oferta y demanda y el intercambio de mercanc as se vaya convirtiendo en intercambio de equivalentes lo cual supondr a ya el triunfo de la sociedad socialista

9051320 the minor iphone security issue which surfaced this week is fixed in a software update which will be released in september
9051321 apple quickly released updates to fix 3g connectivity issues this year but consistently takes many months to release security updates
9051322 even when a user chooses to physically secure the device with a four digit passcode apple has chosen to still permit the user to use some functionality
9051323 by selecting to perform an emergency call the user can then gain access to other options which eventually leads them to near full access on the phone never having had to enter that passcode
9051324 this is an exceptionable security flaw that is not an acceptable risk for many enterprises and consumers alike
9051325 until apple begins to publicly address these fundamental design development and process issues enterprises will remain skeptical of the

9051329 i would say his physical presence and confidence and definitely his technical ability in making great saves you know making saves that other goalkeepers might not make he can pluck them out of the air
9051330 whether its the top corner or down below hes got a fantastic stretch on him
9051331 one of the big things about celtic or rangers goalkeepers for that matter is that you have got to put up with periods of time that you dont have a lot to do so that composure and that focus to the job in hand is something that you have to keep working at
9051332 hes done it quite well but there is times when he maybe just loses that a little bit and that is something that as he matures and gets more experienced he will definitely definitely get better
9051333 he makes right good saves he can be the difference at times and you can count the mistakes in one hand over the course of the season
9051334 he is quick around the area which you need to be and hes brave
9051335 you have got to have broad shoulders because if you do make a mistake you have to got to carry on and dont let the people get at you
9051336 you need to read situations very well and i think allan has got that ingredient hes sharp has good agility and commands the area more each time he plays and that comes with confidence and feeling at home in that position
9051337 its all about consistency really the more consistent you can be with pulling a match winning save i think thats what puts you at the top of the pile

9051345 so come sept 7 i believe when we play the
9051346 playing in an old firm game is very special especially the two within ten days at parkhead were very good for us
9051347 and when jan scored the last minute winner to make it 2 1 it gave us a bit of momentum and that managed to carry us through to winning the league
9051348 and if you manage to win the first old firm game of the season it sometimes gives you a bit of an edge
9051349 every game is important obviously old firm games have that extra edge to them and obviously results between the two teams throughout the season can have a bearing on the league title
9051350 i think now we have a strong squad probably stronger than last year at the minute so hopefully we can do the business and obviously surprise celtic
9051351 i think we are pretty much the same and rangers have made a lot of new signings and weve brought a few in so we know it will be a very difficult season again

9051405 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9051406 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9051407 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out
9051408 in a loft that was a converted ice factory it had 40 foot ceilings it was gorgeous
9051409 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9051410 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9051411 the truth is i was between roles just being lazy and letting it grow out when i came onto this project both stephen and david wanted me to keep it long i think it really suits jerry david told me he really did go to trial with long hair so its not out of the realm of possibility
9051412 i dont want people to think the public defenders are the good guys and the das office are the bad guys
9051413 were going for the gray areas i hope people are entranced with what michelle does shes not someone you can root for all the time
9051414 once again the right conclusion to draw from the statistics is that the system is working as intended
9051415 this information shows that from time to time sentencing decisions are made which the court of appeal considers are wrong accordingly they are corrected
9051416 only around 77 cases involving 106 defendants were referred in the last year and of these the sentence was increased in the case of 75 defendants this should be seen in the context that there were over 120 000 disposals made in the crown court last year
9051417 cases where sentences are increased or indeed reduced show the strength of the system which provides a proper mechanism for review both of unduly lenient sentences and those which defendants argue are excessive
9051418 in past years the release of the equivalent statistics has resulted in personalised criticism of individual judges which in many cases was unfair and disproportionate critics should bear in mind judges must balance different complex factors alongside legislative provisions as well as decisions by the court of appeal and sentencing guidelines not all cases are the same and the specific circumstances will vary enormously if it is a complex and unprecedented decision it is only right that it should be considered by the court of appeal so the court can consider what the appropriate sentencing approach should be particular focus on any individual decision should be set in the context of the fact that many sentencing judges deal with a very large number of cases each year not every successful appeal to the court of appeal involves criticism of the trial judge by way of example a decision of the court of appeal giving further guidance may have been issued in the meantime or sentencing guidelines changed
9051419 i liked it everything about it i just liked my work
9051420 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9051421 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional

9051424 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl

9051432 the greatest end zone dance of all time has to be cuba gooding jr
9051433 i am just thinking next time i try my best i hope i can win
9051434 maybe i like the grass more because the ball is low and i can hit hard
9051435 then on the hard court the ball sometimes jumps too high for me
9051436 but i feel like now my forehand is more aggressive before it was just my backhand i just want to improve my serve maybe then i can keep going
9051437 i started to think oh maybe today i dont have to play three sets
9051438 because in the first two rounds i always played three sets maybe i played not so fast as i did before that gave her a chance and she came back for the second set
9051439 i arrived in new york and i told my husband the courts are different from beijing
9051440 he said dont think about that maybe its different for the mind but they didnt change the balls they didnt change the court the only change is for yourself
9051441 so i thought okay maybe i need to change myself
9051442 but i understand youve got to choose sides either north or south
9051443 you go to take batting practice and the rats are bigger than pigs out there
9051444 you want to take a look i think the rats are lifting weights
9051445 if you can believe everything ozzie says then i guess you should be i havent seen any rats around here to be honest with you
9051446 in the years when neither team was really going anyplace this is all you had to talk about all year
9051447 right now most people are focused on winning the division and getting to the world series
9051448 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious
9051449 i know him as a man that answers straight questions with straight answers
9051450 and hes been a sox fan since before he was a senator like most fans whenever i see him he wants to know if we have enough pitching
9051451 a couple months ago when he asked that question i told him pitching is like votes you can never be comfortable you have enough
9051452 we havent had a lot of success there but i love going back
9051453 definitely playing in the georgia dome is a big time game
9051454 im pretty sure in their last year they want to get a win in atlanta
9051455 every time i watch film i realize another guy stands out
9051456 they do a good job and we are going to have to be on our a game
9051457 its really more about finding out who we are and where weve got to go to get to where we want to be
9051458 we got a bullseye with teams looking at us but hey were looking up too
9051459 i think probably after the first scrimmage it was pretty evident that he was going to have some role as one of the three receivers that we use quite a bit
9051460 we want to get clemson on the map and let people know that were legit were serious
9051461 it would be nice to go out there and have a great game
9051462 hes a great pet already answers to his name and loves to travel and ride in the car
9051463 he sleeps in his kennel in the den and is fed hills prescription maintenance dog food at 6 a m and 6 p m daily
9051464 on the bright side im really familiar with both cars i dont foresee any issues going from one to the other
9051465 speed breaking points theyre similar and i know everyone im working with theyre both very competitive cars and hopefully ill be able to come away with two good results
9051466 weve accomplished a lot together but we feel like we can do even bigger things in the future
9051467 the team 7 eleven car has been a fixture at the top level of the indycar series since it debuted in 2003 and we expect to keep it there for a long time
9051468 its completely different from the setup of the car to the driving style its a finesse game
9051469 its unfortunate that you have to come with a car thats sort of in the ballpark youll see us making a lot of changes this weekend
9051470 its a short time to learn everything its a challenge
9051471 if you want to get to a 13th game you better take care of game 1
9051472 it will probably be the most hectic atmosphere weve ever been in
9051473 everyone tells me this is the venue that is maybe the toughest in the country to play i dont think we can simulate whats going to go on down there
9051474 our players understand that were in harms way in this game
9051475 weve tried when you get good its hard to get a game it really is i dont want to fly all over the country where our fans cant drive
9051476 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9051477 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9051478 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9051479 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9051480 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours

9051487 the greatest end zone dance of all time has to be
9051488 if john mccain is looking at pennsylvania i think he needed a conservative on the ticket to help with these blue collar working pennsylvanians
9051489 and the polls show they are the swing voters not only in pennsylvania but nationwide
9051490 i dont think that the primary motive for him was to siphon off female votes i think that might end up being a benefit of his decision but i dont think it was the motivating factor
9051491 i think they wanted to pick somebody that he believes is a genuine american
9051492 shes refreshing in american politics and its going to be a great choice for us here in pennsylvania
9051493 i think it will have people want to take a second look at the ticket this is kind of a neat weird political year and a lot of the usual political notions have kind of been thrown out the window
9051494 its a move to counter whats happening with obama its a good move but its a tactic i think at this point
9051495 the great enterprise the manchu reconstruction of imperial order in seventeenth century china
9051496 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
9051497 its pretty much just investors exiting positions going into a long weekend
9051498 i wouldnt read a ton into it because the volume was so light

9051518 theres more passing in this offense than we traditionally had
9051519 i think tight end will probably be more of a factor and a lot more crossing patterns
9051520 in fact we run a lot of the same stuff delaware runs we will stretch the field also i think thats one of the better things we do
9051521 with our offense right now were using the short pass a lot and thats a good thing early
9051522 during the week i really want to work extremely hard work the kids hard and prepare for every situation that can come up by the time game day comes its over its too late to worry
9051523 im pretty calm and cool during the game talking to guys on the headsets and calling the plays
9051524 dont worry the work day has an end to it
9051525 hes a lefty comes to the net a lot plays aggressive
9051526 he doesnt give you too much rhythm but i feel like im playing well just now im confident and i look forward to the match
9051527 i thought that the whole match was tough mentally and i dealt with it well
9051528 i was happy with the way i came back from all of the different situations that he put me in and i managed to come out on top
9051529 the ongoing rally might persist through september but the choppy and overlapping rally of european stocks from the july low signals that the overall decline is not finished yet
9051530 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
9051531 i guess the only state you cant be from is the 45th state
9051532 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9051533 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9051534 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9051535 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9051536 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9051537 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9051538 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
9051539 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
9051540 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
9051541 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
9051542 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
9051543 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighbourhood
9051544 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking at that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
9051545 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
9051546 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
9051547 this is a hard job to do on a bike
9051548 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
9051549 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
9051550 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
9051551 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
9051552 we did our research before making any decisions and we were confident that the new credit system would have a positive affect on conversions especially among new customers
9051553 at the end of the day research is only research and results are what really matter thats why we were elated when our expectations were reaffirmed by the consistent boost in new sign ups
9051554 the postponement of this will make it less likely that physicians will treat medicaid patients
9051555 statistics provided to the state show teachers cover about 56 percent of rate costs for their health insurance while state employees pay in only about a third of the overall cost but estimates show that bringing teachers into the same plans as state employees would cost the state an additional 229 million for the next two year budget in the 2013 2015 budget estimates put the cost at 395 million
9051556 i have always been driven to the desert i think the landscape itself influences people in a certain way
9051557 we experienced the desert and the sun and the extreme cold in the desert to the nonstop rain in oregon i think the weather and the landscape also influences the character
9051558 this is the exploration of the mystery of a woman called sylvia who has an emotional journey that takes her to the extremes it explores what makes her so damaged
9051559 you should ask people that question why are people so flawed because thats who we are
9051560 why is it when you watch a film and something happens that moves you it either moves you to tears or gives a chill down your spine its because we can see ourselves in that moment
9051561 the danger to children from mercury poisoning was never as grave as painted
9051562 i like the metro its better than renting a car in d c
9051563 faster than a cab cheaper than a cab i metro to work everyday too so its kind of my go to method of transportation
9051564 i can see it just tying up or further delaying your travel getting here probably the frustration level is gonna get high so i think its probably gonna be tense for some people
9051565 the amount of work that has to be done we need a three day weekend to do it and typically for us labor day weekend ridership is very light on the rail system
9051566 i can understand that there are repairs and construction that needs to be done and people need to be a little more flexible but at the same time it is a holiday weekend why couldnt they have waited
9051567 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9051568 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9051569 i gotta tell you i did not stand on the corners of the streets of baltimore and say im gonna be the assistant adjutant general
9051570 making a difference is what i also think happens wearing the uniform
9051571 theres a sense of personal satisfaction that i think each and every one of us gets from being able to do that
9051572 it gave me a sense of knowing who i was because it was important for me to understand what was important to me
9051573 thats carried me through the rest of my career and life quite frankly
9051574 i may never know what that impact is but im gonna live everyday as if i should have an impact on others
9051575 my bags are packed just call my name and ill be there just let me know when
9051576 this is a tire that come off a safeway cart

9051603 i would say we have done a good job even if it is too early to say what the situation will be here during the race weekend
9051604 it was a pleasure to meet with president montezemolo who visited the track today
9051605 now we have to try and do everything as well as possible to get back to winning again starting with the race in spa

9051607 today we made some positive steps forward for the italian grand prix particularly with the balance and set up
9051608 i could push particularly in the afternoon and the pace over the longer runs was also good
9051609 you never know what the other teams are doing with their own programmes but i think the race will be very close between us and honda i think weve made good progress here
9051610 this three day test has produced positive results for us
9051611 we can be particularly satisfied that the car ran 100 percent reliably on track throughout and we completed over 1 800 kilometres the most of any team here with today being particularly busy
9051612 in general this three day test has gone well and produced some quite promising results
9051613 our focus was always on reliability and consistency rather than looking for performance and the results would indicate that we are in good shape for the upcoming races
9051614 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
9051615 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
9051616 is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frogs and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

9051652 tem cinco ou seis clubes que n o est o distanciando
9051653 teremos jogos dif ceis pela frente e o primeiro o vit ria jogar no barrad o muito dif cil mas pretendo colocar em pr tica algumas coisas que tenho em mente
9051654 a gente conversa muito com os jogadores para tentar acertar e motivar cada um deles temos que trabalhar forte dentro do campo e buscar motiva o fora dele a motiva o para qualquer ser humano primordial se a gente puder manter isso bem elevado ser timo para o nosso dia a dia
9051655 n o foi coisa de dinheiro a proposta do fluminense foi maior que a do hamburgo um desafio na minha carreira e vamos ver no que vai dar quero ser feliz l como fui no fluminense
9051656 uma grande equipe na alemanha tem grandes jogadores se eu jogar o que vinha jogando aqui tenho certeza que vou brilhar l tamb m
9051657 ruim sair de um clube onde voc dolo queria sair daqui com o t tulo da libertadores assim como todos torcedores queriam mas estou feliz por tudo que aconteceu comigo no fluminense s tenho a agradecer ao clube
9051658 nesta temporada eu recebi propostas de outros time mas decidi ficar em s o paulo por isso eles n o dificultaram a minha sa da agora diante de uma oportunidade que muito boa

9051661 complicou um pouco para ir para a sele o brasileira pois na r ssia mais dif cil mas quando se faz um bom trabalho reconhecido para o mundo todo ser conseq ncia do trabalho primeiro pensar no novo clube
9051662 being able to quantify the speed with which populations are able to adapt to these sort of selection pressures is essential for formulating comprehensive policy about climate change
9051663 thats the great thing about stickleback they dont require much prodding to produce a lot of offspring
9051664 these ideas about natural selection and how that affects evolution have been around all the way back to darwin 150 years ago but what he didnt have was any knowledge of genetics
9051665 were only now getting to the stage that we can pinpoint the genes that are responsible for morphological traits that help a species survive and deal with changing environments
9051666 we really need to actually put numbers on these things
9051667 if we exceed those thresholds the species is going to be in trouble and itll go extinct
9051668 is planning for housing needs transportation needs and climate change needs all at the same time
9051669 all going to support a development pattern that will help the state meet its climate goals
9051670 i want to reassure georgians that our states banking industry remains on solid footing and two thirds of banks in our state have been profitable year to date
9051671 while there is concern about many of our industries given the national economic climate georgians should not overreact to the news of one bank closing the georgia department of banking and finance along with the fdic have worked quickly to ensure all deposit funds of the customers of this bank are protected and available through the transfer of accounts to regions bank
9051672 this allows us to put more troopers on the road patrolling quicker
9051673 these violations are the ones officers see repeatedly when investigating traffic crashes especially ones which result in a traffic death
9051674 last year four of the 12 deaths over the labor day holiday period involved an alcohol or drug impaired driver and four of the 12 people killed were not wearing seat belts
9051675 past experience has shown the majority of the fatalities over a holiday weekend occur on the state routes county roads and city streets
9051676 with the increase in travel expected for the holiday weekend drivers should be prepared and plan ahead
9051677 planning begins with safety at the top of the list
9051678 drivers should take every precaution to minimize the chance of being stranded on the road
9051679 once on the road be alert for potential dangers by obeying the posted speed limit not tailgating allowing plenty of space before merging in front of tractor trailers using a designated driver if alcohol will be in your plans making sure everyone is wearing a seat belt and taking the time to properly restrain children in a motor vehicle
9051680 drivers who use star g s p are extra eyes on the road to help law enforcement officers save lives
9051681 de melder noemde de naam van een van de kapers
9051682 die leek fonetisch veel op de achternaam van mijn cli nt toen heeft men de passagierslijst erbij gepakt
9051683 ze heeft ronduit toegegeven dat ze niet veel trek had in de vakantie en dat ze op aanraden van coco eerder op de dag het contactslot van de auto onklaar had gemaakt in een poging het vliegtuig te missen
9051684 het ziet er niet naar uit dat deze romance nog zal voortduren
9051685 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus
9051686 in todays economy fiscal prudence and responsibility call for tax reduction r educing taxes is the best way open to us to increase revenues
9051687 veto every pork laden spending bill and make their authors famous
9051688 i work with a neutral palette because i think childrens clothes are gender defined from day one i believe that finding high quality simply designed clothing in neutral colors is difficult so i wanted to fill that space in the market catti said in a recent interview
9051689 most of the designs this season can be used as a dress and a tunic a lot of the pieces can be worn by either boys or girls i use great materials like cotton cashmere and wool that are easily combined and washable without being boring i believe in making timeless yet contemporary pieces that allow kids to play and feel comfortable and look great at the same time
9051690 the design is reduced to the essential leaving out excess decoration and loud visible labels
9051691 the risk of a hard landing accompanied by an exchange rate crisis somewhere in the region is significant and rising
9051692 i shouldnt really be reviewing this movie because i only saw the first half after that i buried my head in my hands
9051693 i actually think if we deal with global warming in a way which raises peoples energy bills we will have
9051694 aplaudo al senador mccain por seleccionar a la gobernadora palin esta decisi n es otro ejemplo de porqu los estadunidenses pueden confiar en l tanto para tomar sabias decisiones como para dirigir el pa s
9051695 la gobernadora palin es una probada reformista una inteligente administradora de los d lares de los contribuyentes y una campeona de la responsabilidad en el gobierno
9051696 el xito de la gobernadora palin se debe a su dedicaci n a los principios y a su comprometido trabajo tico y sirve como un ejemplo maravilloso del esp ritu de estados unidos
9051697 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
9051698 id give it a minute or two if i were you son
9051699 you are like the sun and i am earth together we are one
9051700 la gente ha empezado a irse llev ndose sus pertenencias m s valiosas
9051701 shes for drilling in anwr her husband works for an oil company and she opposes the request of
9051702 its interesting to see the elaborate rationalization youve constructed for yourself to
9051703 yeah ive heard the word vpilf come up more than once today
9051704 im almost embarrassed to admit that i discovered a website called http www vpilf com
9051705 lets give a hand to hillary for her historic campaign and keep it going
9051706 the inspired choice of sarah palin highlights the radical views of obama biden on life and marriage catholic voters couldnt have a starker contrast this november
9051707 catholics like most americans are cautiously optimistic that the troop surge has calmed iraq catholics will naturally turn their attention to which candidate will stand strong on behalf of families
9051708 barack obama is not that candidate barack obama wants to repeal the defense of marriage act his first act as president has nothing to do with energy or iraq he wants to enshrine the right to abortion in federal law by signing the freedom of choice act
9051709 barack obama is so extreme on abortion that he thinks that babies who survive an abortion and are miraculously born alive should be refused food and water and be left to die
9051710 john mccain together with sarah palin is a natural choice for catholics mccain has a strong pro life record and he has made a commitment to selecting judges who will respect the constitution mccain has even bucked his own party on immigration and torture we think these positions align john mccain closer to catholic teaching and we are proud to stand with him as he prepares for a very difficult election ahead
9051711 the stakes of this election are too large to ignore
9051712 its on life support as the banks try to rescue their loans
9051713 this new business model means allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation shipping and private equity
9051714 we will cease our principal investment activities sell remaining non core assets and in the future only use the balance sheet to co invest in our managed funds
9051715 this new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets
9051716 with its previous complex structure allco had entered some non core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding
9051717 they were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale
9051718 we have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes which fit our funds management model
9051719 i picked a hell of a day to take these guys fishing for the first time
9051720 one hour after they drank red bull their blood system was no longer normal
9051721 if you have any predisposition to cardiovascular disease then i would think twice about drinking it
9051722 something quirky about the effect of the combination of the two
9051723 the study does not show effects which would go beyond drinking a normal cup of coffee
9051724 the health effects of this drink cannot be judged basing on studies from other countries it will have to be examined by unbs first
9051725 i feel more active after drinking it it is well packaged in an attractive can it carries an aura of class
9051726 it is neutral the kind of drink that you take without feeling out of place you can enjoy it anywhere it also tastes better than most energy drinks
9051727 it keeps me alert when i go out with friends i take red bull to keep up with the pace of the party especially because i dont take alcohol and dont like soda
9051728 i take it because it is mild it would never get to my head it is safer than alcohol
9051729 what has been done by the us is what is expected the only way that joseph kony can extricate himself from that type of high level ranking of a terrorist is for him to disarm and submit himself to the jurisdiction of the high court of uganda for purposes of accountability and to provide a basis to lasting peace and reconciliation
9051730 ranking him highly is also a warning by the international community to those who have been abetting konys activities to stop their support
9051731 give him some tequila and he will sing like a canarie
9051732 these results show the strong growth in the group s profitability
9051733 an start tawkin lak iss to them fellers bout warshin dishes an renchin dishes an puttin stuff away ovair
9051734 dont worry bout those ghost notes they aint nothin but rebound to make it sound and feel good
9051735 oh my god you bought us some horta oh you didnt bring a boureki did you you made courgette patties especially for us
9051736 with all due respect to gov kaine hes been a governor for three years
9051737 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
9051738 with all due respect to gov kaine hes been a governor for three years
9051739 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
9051740 ele um timo profissional e uma pessoa de car ter conheci ele em 2001 quando eu dirigia o coritiba ele fez um timo trabalho aqui e tem um futuro brilhante pela frente
9051741 o ivo um grande profissional tenho certeza de que ele juntamente com o esfor o de todos vai conseguir recolocar o juventude na s rie a
9051742 tem cinco ou seis clubes que n o est o distanciando
9051743 teremos jogos dif ceis pela frente e o primeiro o vit ria jogar no barrad o muito dif cil mas pretendo colocar em pr tica algumas coisas que tenho em mente
9051744 a gente conversa muito com os jogadores para tentar acertar e motivar cada um deles temos que trabalhar forte dentro do campo e buscar motiva o fora dele a motiva o para qualquer ser humano primordial se a gente puder manter isso bem elevado ser timo para o nosso dia a dia
9051745 a proposta do flu foi maior que a do hamburgo um desafio na minha carreira e vamos ver no que vai dar
9051746 n o foi coisa de dinheiro a proposta do fluminense foi maior que a do hamburgo um desafio na minha carreira e vamos ver no que vai dar quero ser feliz l como fui no fluminense
9051747 uma grande equipe na alemanha tem grandes jogadores se eu jogar o que vinha jogando aqui tenho certeza que vou brilhar l tamb m
9051748 ruim sair de um clube onde voc dolo queria sair daqui com o t tulo da libertadores assim como todos torcedores queriam mas estou feliz por tudo que aconteceu comigo no fluminense s tenho a agradecer ao clube
9051749 um bom resultado ol mpico importante para dar visibilidade ao esporte e disseminar seus valores a conquista de uma medalha como fez a maurren atinge milh es de jovens que passam a considerar o esporte uma possibilidade de sucesso na vida
9051750 lumber and wood products this time around is having a horrible time theyre really really hurting but in our relative sense of how it affects our different mix of our economy today its not as a big a hit to us as it would have been back 30 years ago
9051751 you couldnt really identify your targets out to 4 000 meters but the gun could shoot that far so one of the things theyve done since then is this enhancement package which gives it a 50 power sight so you can actually see and identify targets out to the range of the gun
9051752 i think the level of play that mystique that comes with big league baseball would bring me here the star factor definitely
9051753 we also decided it was going to be a huge long shot and that we had a twin objective one we had to get on major league baseballs radar screen which portland was not
9051754 and we very quietly went around and got 53 co sponsors before we dropped our bill so when we dropped it there was a lot of controversy about it and we were still working on the mechanism
9051755 was really sad because we were really close if we had gotten a vote on the senate floor we would have passed and i am convinced that if we had gotten through in 2001 we were the only solution for the expos
9051756 opposition to any kind of a funding scheme that wasnt a complete private source has been the one thing that has killed major league baseball from coming to portland
9051757 there was never an owner you had some interested businessmen there was never an owner who was committed
9051758 there were some efforts and people got their hopes up but im not sure how realistic that was
9051759 i have since realized that the political stars dont appear to align and probably isnt going to create an opportunity for us to have major league baseball so ive been very supportive of merritt paulsons effort to bring major league soccer to portland and then to cause a stadium to be built in the lents neighborhood for triple a baseball
9051760 for portland to be under consideration for major league soccer theyve been very clear that pge park has to be renovated so as to be soccer specific
9051761 its not a simple deal by any stretch of the imagination and were going to need public support to make the facility changes happen
9051762 unfortunately the bullet hit striker and striker was later pronounced deceased at a local veterinary clinic
9051763 when you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on
9051764 but it doesnt take away from the fact that we are the green energy capital of the world that we had the biggest rally during the campaign season right in our home state
9051765 how would you have it how would you have me
9051766 tonight the democrats have a nominee i agree with them on this change is needed but not just in washington d c our state faces a record deficit and one party cant solve our problems alone
9051767 yknow my opponent talks like barack obama but he votes like george bush
9051768 oregon needs a senator who will fight for affordable health care living wage jobs an end to the war and a smart energy policy not a senator who will give us more of bush and mccains failed policies
9051769 were having finger food wine its a small town mentality we do this in homes i dont think its like a big city we dont go to restaurants and i have a big house the whole world is watching literally the whole world is watching
9051770 as you can see i have an incredibly pumped excited delegation behind us we are the green energy capital of the world and we had the biggest rally during the entire campaign season right in our home state
9051771 i was the chair of the bill clinton campaign in oregon in 1992 and 1996 and i have watched hillary clinton and bill clinton do everything in their power to convince this convention to vote for barack obama
9051772 he is showing a lot of interest in his environment he is kind of ducking in and out of those ahem zooming in and out of the enclosure he is picking up objects he is definitely exploring his world a lot more
9051773 neither my opponent nor i are very well known across the district because people dont know us and so well just run the campaign that we had intended to run
9051774 he touched on all those things that make america great and all the things americans want to see from education to smart energy to immigration policy to getting out of iraq
9051775 i think the people are ready to take back our country and barack obama is our messenger
9051776 we have so much work to do to make barack obama the next president of the united states
9051777 as a labor lawyer working with families across the state i see them suffer and i see how hard it is to access quality education and healthcare and to pay for bare necessities
9051778 i really really believe in this man because he is the one
9051779 he just cares hes a team player and hes not a soloist
9051780 i think hes someone who is actually going to listen to people because he already has since his days working in south chicago
9051781 this is a representation of the journey my life to this point has been on to improve the lives of others
9051782 what he said about how were in this not for a candidate but for us we have to take responsibility
9051783 this message of change and bringing people together and unifying us just resonated with me
9051784 its because weve had eight years of division that this means so much
9051785 i feel his spirit here rejoicing even though he was assassinated im rejoicing with him and with obama
9051786 i was ready to quite and i met him and he had that light he cared about the real people
9051787 the passion and love he shows for his family he extends to everyone else
9051788 it says in the bible that everything has a time and a place this is the time today
9051789 so many poor people think that is all there is
9051790 but he gives our people hope when we see a young black man be all he can be
9051791 this is a freeing moment for blacks i know i lived the discrimination too
9051792 being able to see the glass ceiling break for minorities and women and to realize there is still an american dream for people has been inspiring
9051793 he cares about peoples concerns those thoughts keep him up at night
9051794 i understood the challenge he was going to go through
9051795 he talked tonight about the changing sentiment in the country and i felt that way when i ran in denver
9051796 its part of the story its what america is its a melting pot thats how it is and i identify with that
9051797 he appeals to us because he is a new generation leader he does not use race he doesnt talk about race its just what it is
9051798 he has really made a strong outreach to indian country and has a definite disability and native american platform
9051799 hes the first candidate since bobby kennedy to visit an indian reservation
9051800 we are all the underdogs and when we unite we are no longer the underdogs and theres an opportunity for all of us in indian country we call it be a part of the circle
9051801 its emotional for me because you see people here of all races of all creeds you see gays you see lesbians you dont see this at the republican convention and thats why i am a democrat
9051802 i think that you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers
9051803 the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9051804 whatevers going on in the rest of the world whether its wars kidnappings or crimes this is a peaceful sunday night with the grateful dead
9051805 sarah how a hockey mom turned alaskas political establishment upside down
9051806 a symbol of pride for past and present servicemen and women
9051807 i think it is a really good thing we should be flying every flag we have
9051808 i think it demonstrates that we are a country which believes in patriotism
9051809 i think it gives a sense of pride and hopefully helps to instill this in younger people
9051810 i think it is really rather nice that the flag will be flying it does demonstrate a certain pride in the country
9051811 the flag is a unifying symbol in our modern multicultural society i am very proud of our country and the values it represents and by flying the flag from our civic buildings it is another small way we can celebrate that pride

9051816 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington
9051817 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9051818 mccain will be dead in a year and she will be in charge
9051819 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9051820 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9051821 when a cause comes along and you know in your bones that it is just yet refuse to defend it at that moment you begin to die and i have never seen so many corpses walking around talking about justice

9051947 i am convinced that if we are to wake from the weariness that is taking hold of the church in this country we must return to the sources of our catholic identity and mission to renew our strength and vitality
9051948 all catholics who love the church and care deeply about the future of catholicism
9051949 though we are strengthened and healed by the lord through his word and sacraments the majority of us are not responding to our lords call to go out on his mission of hope
9051950 one of the reasons why we are gathered but not sent is due to a lack of confidence and knowledge of the catholic faith
9051951 it appears that many of us have forgotten the basic truth about the nature of the church that we have been gathered as a people of god not to be served but rather to serve god and each other especially the weak and the poor
9051952 as i have reflected on the great issues facing this generation in the life of the church i have become more and more convinced that the answers are to be found through a prayerful faithful and creative engagement with the deposit of faith presented in the documents of the second vatican council and its great summary the catechism of the catholic church
9051953 we have all witnessed with alarm many who profess to be catholics disavowing the churchs teaching authority particularly that of the pope and the congregation for the doctrine of the faith dismissing apostolic traditions and the doctrines of the fathers and giving the place of honour to the fashionable opinions of society

9052042 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9052043 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9052044 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9052045 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9052046 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9052047 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9052048 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9052049 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9052050 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9052051 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9052052 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about

9052076 she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9052077 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9052078 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9052079 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9052080 the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling

9052084 the olympics bring so much pressure it was easy here as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster time my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9052085 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers

9052087 i ran a season best and i plan to improve on that in brussels and stuttgart i want to end up as world number one at the end of the year
9052088 the first three days after the olympics race i was pretty sick to my stomach
9052089 i felt like i was living in a nightmare youre going to be hurt but youve got to pick yourself up again
9052090 i know its been two weeks but im still having nightmares
9052091 so to come out today and have a successful run was really meaningful and probably the best therapy for me

9052123 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9052124 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9052125 traditionally september is a weak month for stocks and i dont think were going to escape that

9052148 barack landed one ko punch after another thats the part of the speech i enjoyed the most
9052149 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america

9052157 die unions fraktion im bundestag will offenbar mit der atomm ll endlagerfrage nichts zu tun haben
9052158 vielleicht kann ministerpr sident oettinger dazu beitragen dass diese landebahn gebaut wird
9052159 die union vor allem ihre ministerpr sidenten im s den blockieren
9052160 wenn wir die mitte der gesellschaft st rken wollen dann m ssen wir insbesondere familien mit kindern entlasten
9052161 die idee des familiensplittings stammt aus unserem grundsatzprogramm und wir sollten diesen richtigen ansatz f r zuk nftiges regierungshandeln aufnehmen
9052162 eine gro e koalition ber 2009 hinaus w re nicht im interesse unserer demokratie sie muss eine ausnahmeerscheinung bleiben

9052164 dann ist die absolute merhheit von union und fdp gesichert
9052165 they boiled it and them and two other family members were taking pieces out of the pot periodically and eating it
9052166 when miss edwards began to eat the piece she noticed what appeared to be a piece of grizzle attached to the meat
9052167 so she took the fork and she pulled it off because she didnt want to consume it and she looked at it closer and it appeared to be a human finger
9052168 we havent had them tested until we knew it was human
9052169 but now that its been determined that it is theyre undergoing blood work to determine whether theres anything they may have contracted
9052170 i believe the odds of it getting into the oxtail from the process of how oxtail is done here and at the factory its very unlikely that it came from the oxtail
9052171 and we cut it and sell it frozen so theres another reason why i know that it didnt come from here because we dont ever refreeze it thaw it or refreeze it and number two if somebody loses a finger youre picking up that finger and youre going to a hospital
9052172 i believe these people and that finger was in that meat
9052173 what makes a good pig what makes a great pig
9052174 hes a young man and hes really well positioned for long term success as a national leader
9052175 i never got into this with the idea that i needed this or that i wanted something out of this
9052176 theres little doubt in my mind he could have something like that if hes interested
9052177 i think you could see him as a mccain chief of staff as attorney general as secretary of commerce or secretary of energy theres any number of positions that someone with his talent could fill
9052178 my advice would be if he did have national aspirations that it may not be a great idea to run for governor again
9052179 its really hard to win three terms regardless of how skilled you are theres a fatigue with the populace
9052180 you almost expect he might say running the state is not my problem anymore

9052184 build a coalition largely of pro choice people but with some a few pro lifers in order to win 60 seats in the u s senate
9052185 an example of senator obamas ability to find common ground
9052186 having senator casey up there who disagrees with barack obama on the issue of abortion who will talk about it and talk about how they disagree but how he respects obama and the way he handles this issue its something that they hope catholic voters will be listening to
9052187 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion but the fact that im speaking here is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
9052188 respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
9052189 while it unequivocally endorses a womans right to abortion and the roe v wade affirming it the platform also includes calls for support for alternatives to abortion those measures include improved prenatal care better financing for sex education family planning and parenting classes and more help for adoption
9052190 it was going very fast i dont know if the driver fell asleep but there were no brakes
9052191 we are interviewing him and attempting to learn what was going through his mind as well as gathering additional evidence to support any sort of culpability and what that culpability is

9052193 our citizens across the country may think that in fact there are no drugs in prison sadly that is not the case
9052194 over the next five years funds up to an amount of 120 million will go towards maintaining and putting in place a zero tolerance policy on drugs
9052195 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this
9052196 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9052197 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9052198 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free
9052199 we think it will be a choice between certainty and risk
9052200 love him or hate him our prime minister knows where he stands on the issues and will offer canadians certainty
9052201 were in rough waters and a steady hand at the wheel is what our economy needs
9052202 all of that is more risk and its more uncertainty around our economy
9052203 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9052204 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9052205 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9052206 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9052207 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9052208 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9052209 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9052210 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9052211 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9052212 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9052213 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected

9052230 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9052231 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9052232 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for
9052233 the blogger came across an article in modern dog magazine about the animal hospice and rehabilitation center angel s gate
9052234 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq
9052235 i heard on the news about the new deployments and while i support our president condoleezza rice and the administration i want to know that we have an exit plan in place i want assurances that we are doing all we can to keep our troops safe
9052236 im not here to judge the idea of withdrawing or the timeline
9052237 im not going to judge even the surge im here to find out what alaskans need of me as their governor
9052238 you might find a guy who is very polished who can do a lot of thing now yet he doesnt have a lot of ceiling
9052239 the raw guy trails that guy a little bit but has tools that can look so superior to the more polished player when hes on on a particular day but on other days it can look like he is a freshman in high school and the other guys a senior but over the course of time if you let them keep playing that freshman if he ever catches up to his abilities will certainly shine and the other guy may end up shining his shoes
9052240 you might have a 22 or 23 year old who can really run who was drafted as a senior sign that youre really hoping will hit but you know he will be overmatched at the next level up
9052241 thats why we have levels thats why we have a rookie club in mesa ariz and the rookie club in boise idaho we try to separate them a little bit based on readiness
9052242 progress continues and we are now planning to submit the environmental impact assessment report and application once there is greater clarity on carbon dioxide regulations and we are able to better align our project with the timing of our potential customers
9052243 we will be reaching out to the provincial government and regulators to discuss some of our concerns
9052244 this just gives us more options just to figure out what is the best thing to meet our potential customers needs
9052245 alberta has given industry clear signals to where we are headed when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions
9052246 alberta has been the regulator and we want to have one regulator when it comes to industry and will work with the federal government to ensure that alberta continues to be that regulator
9052247 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own well its time for them to own their failure its time for us to change america

9052249 its a wonderful building and should be one of irelands iconic buildings
9052250 i would like to see the docklands plans happening as soon as possible i cant disagree that the front of the building is a gathering point for people with drug problems
9052251 the part thats the problem is the front its a dead part of the street with no access coming in
9052252 there are proposals to eliminate vehicular traffic in front of the custom house and to create a citywide destination point on the liffey and restore the custom house to the setting it deserves
9052253 this space would further be connected to the river liffey boardwalk implemented along ormond quay and bachelors walk and create a recreational horizontal plain running from the edge of the building to the river liffey
9052254 veramente io leggo poco i blog giusto quello di una mia amica a dire il vero quindi non saprei

9052260 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary clinton left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9052261 it turns out that the women in america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
9052262 gov sarah palin is an outspoken advocate for pro family policies that energise social conservatives
9052263 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9052264 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9052265 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9052266 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9052267 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9052268 an admirable person who will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9052269 we all know that the highest priority as a vice presidential selection is someone who can take your place
9052270 palin will have to reassure voters of her steadiness when she speaks at the republican convention and when she debates joe biden
9052271 mccain meanwhile will have to carry most of the foreign policy load himself and showcase his good health

9052278 a majority of people didnt know what the term autism meant parents of children diagnosed with autism were chastised for not giving their child enough affection
9052279 it would be a clear sign from the mccain campaign that they were going to be making a very strong bid for the women whom they see up for grabs both the traditional swing independent suburbanites and then the hillary clinton supporters who remain disillusioned

9052282 it gives you all the clues about the things that you should do and the things that you shouldnt do more importantly because roadies is one place especially the auditions where you dont get too many chances
9052283 you know you stand in line for four five hours and then you get in a chance to get in only when your group discussion happens but this will make you jump in if you are lucky

9052286 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9052287 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9052288 the truth is i was between roles just being lazy and letting it grow out when i came onto this project both stephen and david wanted me to keep it long i think it really suits jerry david told me he really did go to trial with long hair so its not out of the realm of possibility
9052289 i dont want people to think the public defenders are the good guys and the das office are the bad guys
9052290 were going for the gray areas i hope people are entranced with what michelle does shes not someone you can root for all the time

9052292 so i feel like ive got unbelievable support from the fans watching me and seeing people in the streets and stuff its really nice
9052293 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl

9052299 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9052300 there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9052301 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9052302 he is willing to take a risk and put it all up on the line i think the republican base will be pleased by this
9052303 this the most out of the box pick in a very long time
9052304 it says to me that the mccain camp believes the democratic convention was a success for the democrats they cannot afford to play it safe
9052305 in all provinces our party has more representation we are comfortable with our majority and our opponents are only spreading misinformation

9052308 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base of the gop he said in a statement
9052309 thats the one issue that this group cares the most about he said referring to evangelical voters
9052310 im open to being persuaded otherwise if she proves herself
9052311 i like some of the personal choices shes made such as carrying a downs child to term cizik said referring the governors infant son who has down syndrome
9052312 i dont think evangelicals are going to vote for this team for superficial partisan reasons i think lots of people are looking beyond labels this time around he said he says he
9052313 the whole idea is to reuse as much material as possible
9052314 you see stuff that you can buy off the shelf today and some stuff that hasnt been available for decades
9052315 this is a mission funded by nasa and other grants as a part of the international polar year activities to see what happens in the polar regions and the atmospheric happenings that have affected that area of the globe
9052316 we studied the formation and loss of sea ice and the effect of radiation on the ice in the airplane we had radiometers particle detectors microwave radiometers and other instruments that can actually look into the water and ice in various forms to understand what has formed as well as see how old the ice is
9052317 basically this threat just underscores the need for hanging on to your
9052318 it also underscores the threat of putting all your eggs in one basket particularly a smartphone or any small gadget that can slip out your pocket while in public transportation
9052319 unfortunately the sleek lines of this phone make that a high probability

9052325 el gran problema para la prensa no es el descenso de lectores sino la ca da de la inversi n publicitaria es el paso de los monopolios locales hacia una plataforma global donde la competencia est en todas partes y la publicidad es menos lucrativa

9052330 i gotta tell you i have very little experience with the whole college party thing i do consider myself to be a pretty social guy but ive not done the crazy wild college experience not yet
9052331 my movie experience was my craziest time and it wasnt even real i do intend to live it up one day
9052332 in the spirit of cooperation and customer satisfaction office depot agreed to provide 2 5 million to the state as an additional discount on these items

9052334 there is every reason to believe that the accused was intoxicated on the night in question
9052335 however the events described by the victim compel me to the conclusion that the accused knew what he was about and intended to end her life
9052336 i am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the necessary murderous intent
9052337 worn out from explaining botanical remedies and the history of everything
9052338 ive discovered that smiling works better than talking i have a new false smile

9052340 as i passed the alley i could smell cigar smoke a sign of republicans
9052341 at one time we were friends with a republican but it ended over political arguments too bad since he knew a lot about beethoven and how the composer came to write the emperor concerto and to think at one time we all went for nature walks together
9052342 in the living room shadows appeared that a week before werent there though it was still early afternoon outside a few leaves on the elm trees had turned yellow when late summer enters a house the whistle of trains crossing the ninth street trestle sounds lonely in the cool air
9052343 why i care so much how i live if it is all to end anyway
9052344 laid low by grief as if it were a sickness
9052345 that wary look of his caution with no certainty of the nature of the threat
9052346 hope is the worst thing in the world it makes a fool of you while it lasts and then when its gone its like theres nothing left of you at all
9052347 they try not to be out there when our kids are coming and going
9052348 it is a concern not just with west florence high but all the sites where we have high volume traffic
9052349 our procedure has normally been to wait until after 10 days to make a true assessment
9052350 in this particular case weve been somewhat hampered because they continue to do road work in front of the school
9052351 the traffic lights have not been put on yet so its difficult for us to make a true assessment until the road work is complete and the traffic lights are turned on
9052352 once that is completed then we can make a better assessment of what is going on and what an appropriate reaction would be
9052353 once we get a better feel of what the actual volume will be then well make an appropriate reaction at that time
9052354 our primary concern is to make sure that our students are safe our faculty members are safe getting in and out of that campus
9052355 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9052356 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
9052357 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
9052358 the old futures dead and gone never to return theres a new way through the hills ahead this one well have to earn this one well have to earn
9052359 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9052360 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
9052361 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
9052362 an actual expert on the regional aspects of iraq and its history
9052363 we advocate where possible dividing major cities along natural boundaries
9052364 on the actual day of the relocation operation iraqi and us led coalition forces would deploy in sufficient numbers to look for snipers cover the flanks of the civilian convoys inspect suspicious vehicles for explosives and conduct similar tasks
9052365 this internal border control system would place some burdens on iraqs internal trade and other aspects of its economy it would complicate the efforts of individuals to cross from one region to another to visit family and friends for the most part these burdens would be bearable for individuals or businesses that need to make frequent crossings across iraqs new internal borders or those willing to pay for the privilege an ez pass system sic might be developed to expedite movements for those with important and regular business to conduct
9052366 we will also have to work though sort of the dark side if you will
9052367 theres no telling how many wars it will take to secure freedom in the homeland
9052368 theres no telling how many wars it will take to secure freedom in the homeland
9052369 our last hope for change however imperfect it may be
9052370 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
9052371 created to arm people with arguments and facts that they could use to counter the propaganda of the boycott campaign within the association of university teachers
9052372 even with the system of permits even with the limits of movement to south africa we never had as much restriction on movement as i see for the people here
9052373 there are areas in which people would live their whole lifetime without visiting because its impossible
9052374 the issue of separate roads different registration of cars driven by different nationalities the indignity of producing a permit any time a soldier asks for it and of waiting in long queues in the boiling sun at checkpoints just to enter your own city i think is worse than what we experienced during apartheid
9052375 the daily indignity to which the palestinian population is subjected far outstrips the apartheid regime and the effectiveness with which the bureaucracy implements the repressive measures far exceed that of the apartheid regime
9052376 this is ridiculous why are they arresting our guides and leaving the man with the megaphone
9052377 these provocations didnt come from us im jewish and i look at this and i say to myself how can i feel fear from other jews
9052378 as you walk into yad vashem you see a quote that says in effect you should know a country not only by what it does but what it tolerates
9052379 so i found it very shocking to then come and here and see footage of teenagers heaping abuse on palestinian children as they come out of school and throwing stones at them and that this should be done in the name of judaism i find totally reprehensible
9052380 what the holocaust teaches us more than anything else is that we must never turn our heads away in the face of injustice
9052381 i wanted to cry i was filled with a blazing anger against a system that could do this to a child johnnys case alone ought to be enough to fill any decent person with revulsion and indignation

9052384 yet the israeli government does a very good job of convincing the whole world that it is the victim in the conflict
9052385 john in support to your link this may be a long but also an interesting reading www davidduke com general humanitarian disaster 595 html no comment necessary the facts are speaking for themselves jenna
9052386 there is much evidence to warrant an in depth investigation of the role played by agents of israel in the 9 11 attacks
9052387 just what level of power do israeli interests wield in the halls of power in the us that any investigation into israeli spying activities on us soil against us intelligence agencies can be so completely quashed
9052388 they were trying to take a current situation and get some training out of it
9052389 500 pound gorilla in israel well armed and trained operates in both gaza and the west bank known to disregard international law to accomplish mission very unlikely to fire on american forces fratricide a concern especially in air space management
9052390 wildcard ruthless and cunning has capability to target u s forces and make it look like a palestinian arab act
9052391 on the morning of 9 11 and just as the wtc towers were crumbling the five israelis were caught doing the happy dance as they videotaped the twin towers fall
9052392 either someone does something about these sick psychopaths or they and their kind in washington and around the world will destroy us all
9052393 since 2003 academic unions have been dominated by a campaign to exclude israelis and nobody else from uk campuses we have warned the ucu general secretary on numerous occasions that this campaign has imported anti semitic ways of thinking into our union she either didnt understand or didnt care that the union is now circulating racist material should be understood as a manifestation of its institutional anti semitism it cannot be written off as yet another random accident
9052394 the ucu is circulating links to david dukes website on behalf of delich
9052395 im not surprised that anti semitic material has again dropped into my inbox from the union activists list what is shocking is the failure of the unions internal procedures to do anything about this ucu prides itself on being an anti racist union in fact it is probably the most complacent public institution in britain in relation to increasing anti semitism and the leadership turns a blind eye or worse to the racism in the union behind all this is the campaign of discrimination against israeli academics which is fostered by some in the union and encouraged by the leadership
9052396 this is precisely the kind of thing which drove me recently to resign from the ucu it has become a union which is complacent about anti semitism it regards prejudicial hostility toward jews from within the union itself as something too unimportant for it to bother with i didnt feel able to remain in an institution which treats anti semitism indulgently as a special exception to a generally anti racist stance
9052397 anti semitism is routinely tolerated on the activist list when it is expressed in the language of hostility to israel
9052398 only a small group of jews and anti racists have been standing up against this culture on the list some have been excluded from the list on trumped up charges others have been driven off the list by continual accusations of bad faith some have left the union because they cannot bear to pay their dues to what they consider to be an anti semitic organization
9052399 criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti semitic

9052401 web 2 0 online communities such as digg youtube flickr and blogs and how those communities compare to traditional email lists
9052402 this research suggests that the key to building successful online communities that attract these individuals is to offer rich opportunities for dialogue and discussion among those with similar but not identical perspectives the people who are most likely forward your emails share your videos and recommend your blog or your podcasts are drawn to open forums where they can express their own views and learn what others have to say organizations that restrict participation on their lists and insist on a high degree of control over their message will be less successful at retaining the interest of these outspoken individuals

9052413 linux is a kernel which is then packaged into a something called a distribution with other software thus making it an operating system
9052414 linux is a cluster of a kernel packaged into about 10 billion different distributions that are almost identical yet cannot agree on a decent set of standards so every software and hardware company cringes at the thought of having to support a super dooper cluster like that is linux

9052421 even at that young age i wanted to be a coach my father was an inspiration for me id go on the ice with his team and id spend a lot of time with him i watched his coach and its something i was interested in even back then
9052422 i thought i was a better fit in europe the hockey was totally different there the big ice more wide open
9052423 in the late 1990s i would say the caliber of hockey in france was pretty good
9052424 we played the champions league where the champions in each league meet in a tournament it was a great experience
9052425 many of the panthers young players are very talented now its all about having them reach their potential and getting the most of their talent in order to succeed you need to be prepared and you need to have structure were going to put together a winning team

9052431 my biggest nightmare would be if the kids ever came up to me and said dad im a vegetarian then i would sit them on the fence and electrocute them
9052432 i will talk to people about the advantages of vegetarianism and it will upset me if weve had a good conversation and they turn around and say something stupid
9052433 i just read a quote from gordon ramsay if my daughter ever grew up and married a vegetarian id never forgive her
9052434 but even that i would forgive because its not my affair its not up to me if he talks stupid or not
9052435 while equity investors are willing to look out toward better times the bond market has concluded that loans will cost more and that fixed income securities held as collateral at many financial institutions are worth less
9052436 we are inclined to believe that the fixed income market may be a little more prescient in this case and that the stock market is going to continue to bounce along at relatively low levels for a while
9052437 the comparisons of year on year earnings are getting easier because the third quarter of 2007 was a disaster and youd think firms would be able to beat them but theyre not going to

9052440 gt gt would you be offended by a male who had a down syndrome child for accepting a vp slot
9052441 and let me make it clear im not so much offended by palins choice im offended by mccains choice
9052442 stellaa shes the one who made this a public issue by taking her test results public and giving speeches about her nobility in bringing a downs child into the world
9052443 at the beginning of her term asked by the local newspaper how she would run the city without experienced department heads she made the job sound like no big deal its not
9052444 i dont know sandra it does say something he is surrounded by investment properties instead of charitable donations which says something to me about his understanding of need brinna ha itd be funny if lieberman would start blogging a la meghan mccain
9052445 oh man i really think it is gonna be pawlenty and like you say im not sure thats going to be that helpful with mn in the fall but it might be helpful with the base pawlentys pretty conservative romney i just believe hes out for sure
9052446 bly i too am hoping for hilarity i think kay bailey hutchinson is unlikely because shes pro choice and mccain needs to focus on his base mccain ronald mcdonald is my great hope
9052447 stella please educate me and im not saying this lightly
9052448 sometimes at my job i take pleasure in beating high school children at uno its the little things
9052449 i keep hoping the story is true and then i hope is isnt and then i go back the other way its nice to know someone came into there swearing gene early i think it helps everything to throw down a couple of well placed curse words

9052454 we westerners are sorry you easterners have to stay up so late
9052455 as a feminist supporter of obama im disgusted with you people decrying john mccain merely because he picked a woman if you actually want women to succeed in this world stop going around screaming about how offended you are whenever it isnt the exact woman you wanted who reaches a high position hes going for a maverick political image and shes known as an anti entrenched gop corruption candidate theres a justification right there for his choosing her think of all the other vps weve had youre saying shes less qualified than dan quayle its like sexism in reverse from liberals i thought hillary clinton was being ridiculous when she said people were discriminating against her due to her gender but the reaction to palins making me think otherwise

9052466 palin is also a member of the anti choice group feminists for life
9052467 upon arrival governor palin and her longtime aide kris perry met with steve schmidt and mark salter of the mccain campaign at mr bob delgado s home in flagstaff mr delgado is the ceo of the hensley corporation which is mrs cindy mccain s family business on thursday morning governor palin and staff were joined by mrs cindy mccain
9052468 palin is a real woman she knows what its like to pay a mortgage raise 5 kids and be very successful in her chosen career
9052469 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9052470 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9052471 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9052472 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9052473 but the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9052474 im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9052475 when i selected joe biden as my running mate it was the product of a deliberate and sober vetting and decision making process aimed at selecting the person who would most capably help me govern in terms of domestic and foreign policy and who would be ready and qualified to be president and commander in chief should anything happen to me i can only assume that john mccain went through a similar process and it is clear that he believes that sarah palin is the individual most ready to help him govern on domestic and foreign policy and who is most prepared to assume the presidency and the position of commander in chief from day one i congratulate him on finding his governing and campaigning partner and welcome her to the race
9052476 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9052477 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9052478 i uh think we can uh change no uh i uh mean uh i uh think it s uh great that uh the governor of our uh 53rd state is uh going to uh wait what is she uh doing michelle wheres my damn script

9052503 there is strong clinical evidence that screening improves the early detection of bowel cancer by 56 per cent compared to those not screened and is 160 per cent more likely to detect pre cancerous polyps that can become cancer if not treated in time
9052504 we found that after ten years of a population screening program the treatment of bowel cancer would cost on average 191 3 million per year marginally higher than the 189 6 million predicted treatment costs if people aged 50 74 years were not screened
9052505 early detection through screening would enable more treatment of early stage bowel cancers and give more patients a better opportunity to survive and potentially return to normal productive lives
9052506 moreover these women are more likely to interact socially with women who are less inclined to breastfeed such as those who are younger less educated overweight obese or smokers

9052518 this seems illogical to me i would think that investors would be willing to pay more for a share that produces the higher yield and less for a share that produces a lower yield
9052519 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl

9052544 playing in an old firm game is very special especially the two within ten days at parkhead were very good for us
9052545 and when jan scored the last minute winner to make it 2 1 it gave us a bit of momentum and that managed to carry us through to winning the league
9052546 and if you manage to win the first old firm game of the season it sometimes gives you a bit of an edge
9052547 every game is important obviously old firm games have that extra edge to them and obviously results between the two teams throughout the season can have a bearing on the league title
9052548 i think now we have a strong squad probably stronger than last year at the minute so hopefully we can do the business and obviously surprise celtic
9052549 i think we are pretty much the same and rangers have made a lot of new signings and weve brought a few in so we know it will be a very difficult season again
9052550 i would say his physical presence and confidence and definitely his technical ability in making great saves you know making saves that other goalkeepers might not make he can pluck them out of the air
9052551 whether its the top corner or down below hes got a fantastic stretch on him
9052552 one of the big things about celtic or rangers goalkeepers for that matter is that you have got to put up with periods of time that you dont have a lot to do so that composure and that focus to the job in hand is something that you have to keep working at
9052553 hes done it quite well but there is times when he maybe just loses that a little bit and that is something that as he matures and gets more experienced he will definitely definitely get better
9052554 he makes right good saves he can be the difference at times and you can count the mistakes in one hand over the course of the season
9052555 he is quick around the area which you need to be and hes brave
9052556 you have got to have broad shoulders because if you do make a mistake you have to got to carry on and dont let the people get at you
9052557 you need to read situations very well and i think allan has got that ingredient hes sharp has good agility and commands the area more each time he plays and that comes with confidence and feeling at home in that position
9052558 its all about consistency really the more consistent you can be with pulling a match winning save i think thats what puts you at the top of the pile
9052559 i used to hear a lot from texas tech but they arent really recruiting me anymore

9052582 the concept of sexual addiction is a controversial one and thats because it is difficult to define

9052592 thats the great thing about stickleback they dont require much prodding to produce a lot of offspring
9052593 these ideas about natural selection and how that affects evolution have been around all the way back to darwin 150 years ago but what he didnt have was any knowledge of genetics
9052594 were only now getting to the stage that we can pinpoint the genes that are responsible for morphological traits that help a species survive and deal with changing environments
9052595 we really need to actually put numbers on these things

9052612 this is a potentially revolutionary advance in the field of forensics
9052613 by employing the powers of genomic technology it is now possible to know with near certainty that a particular individual was at a particular location even with only trace amounts of dna and even if dozens or even hundreds of others were there too
9052614 as technology advances we need to be prepared to keep evidence that down the road could prove again to be useful
9052615 it opens up a whole new can of worms of what s possible to do forensically
9052616 we demonstrate an approach for rapidly and sensitively determining whether a trace amount of genomic dna from an individual is present within a complex dna mixture

9052650 according to a thread on the bind users mailing list there is nothing inherent in the dns protocol that would cause the massive vulnerability length here and elsewhere as it turns out it appears to be a which favors new ns records over cached ones even if the cached ttl is not yet expired the patch changes this in favor of still valid cached records removing the attackers ability to successfully poison the cache outside the small window of opportunity afforded by an expiring ttl which is the way things used to be before the kaminsky debacle source port randomization is nice but removing the root cause of the attacks effectiveness is better

9052709 the first to leave will be international companies there wont be anyone to sell their new shit to and theyll move away to somewhere with less gypsies and more money whos going to buy soap for soft and tender white skin dirty gyppos
9052710 the difference between gypsies and cattle is that cattle are subject to veterinary control livestock cant behave like gypsies but the reverse is allowed bovine rights and freedoms have been under serious pressure to years and during that time the gypsy woman has given birth to twins again and shes as bloody minded as a cow yet again

9052712 racism and intolerance are the great challenges facing modern european society
9052713 publishers should not be engaged in the shameful business of presenting professional honours to an outspoken racist this sends a message that gives the impression bulgarian journalism is insensitive to the consequences of intolerance in society

9052716 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9052717 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think she is a reform minded woman who will give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9052718 it is a governors prerogative a right to fill that cabinet with members whom she or he believes will do best for the people whom we are serving

9052726 i do not know her certainly i think senator mccain has made a bold choice
9052727 not only will she appeal to social conservatives but also to independent thinkers
9052728 and thats something that a lot of us women feel is important not to have all those perks of power but to conduct ourselves as we think the public wants us to
9052729 i wanted to come back as soon as possible so i think this is a good test
9052730 if youre still not totally healed there is much bigger risk to getting a second concussion and thats why we worry about second impact syndrome and later on the more concussions you get in quicker succession its obvious the brain function decreases pretty quickly so we want to make sure everyones healed before they go back into play
9052731 thats not something that i would risk having something worse happen
9052732 letter of invitation from the host company in u k
9052733 but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
9052734 it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes to attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront something fundamental will have to be changed in the nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again
9052735 so far as the nice treaty is concerned the irish people have spoken and like it or lump it the commission and its president have to accept it they should do so with more good grace than they have shown in the recent past the nice treaty no matter what its good intentions is a document that has been democratically tested in only one member state and that is ireland it failed to meet the democratic test in this nation it is an arrogance for any politician either here or any commissioner in europe to ignore the fundamental fact that the irish people have spoken with some clarity on the matter yet last night the president of the commission suggested that somehow or other the irish peoples will can be undone if the commission its leaders or the governments of other european states decide to sweep democracy aside we must ask on what basis is the future of europe to be built over the past two days i attended a meeting of the interim european security and defence assembly i was amazed and gratified in equal measure at the response by european parliamentarians from 28 different european nations to the irish referendum it was an interesting and extraordinary eye opener there was no finger wagging or suggestion that our people had been wrong or were confused rather there was a degree of admiration for the decision the irish had made speakers from the united kingdom to slovenia to greece spoke on the issue they indicated their support for the right of the irish people to make a decision on this matter they were by no means all euro sceptics speakers from a number of countries both within and outside the union indicated that the irish people by its vote reflected a common view and concern that now exists both within the eu and in those states most proximate to the eu members from the eu states who contributed directly in the debate or who spoke privately to the irish delegation members indicated that it was their view i made an effort to do a straw poll that referenda on the nice treaty as it currently stands if held in other member states would meet with the same public response as in ireland there is something distinctly odd about democratic states attempting to take decisions that are out of line with the sentiment of their citizens the gulf that exists between the citizens of europe and the institutions the commissioners and the bureaucrats who are now driving the union is nowhere more visible than in the area of peace security and defence in the run up to the nice treaty the european council decided quite incredibly that somehow the european union could now take charge of peace security and defence issues across the continent of europe both within and outside the union the issues raised by the rejection of the nice treaty in the referendum are of a fundamental nature i have listened with some dismay to todays debate and the debate that has taken place in the weeks since the referendum many in the political leadership of the nation are more focused on making a political point about the referendum than on truly addressing the core issues behind the judgement passed by the people it is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes to attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront something fundamental will have to be changed in the nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again the nice treaty is a complex document which intends to achieve complex things it was sold to the irish people as a means of providing for the enlargement of the european union last night mr prodi made it very clear that was not what the treaty is about he did not however make clear precisely what it is about he was saying therefore that the enlargement process could be achieved without the nice treaty i mentioned the assembly i attended yesterday and the considerable interest shown in the decision of the irish people some thought provoking contributors indicated that the opportunity afforded the irish people should also be offered to the citizens of other member states maybe then europe would get a clear message about what the people of europe expect in the coming years

9052765 st patricks ist ein gef hrlicher gegner der sich gegen die schwedische mannschaft if elfsborg durchgesetzt hat
9052766 sicher haben wir den attraktivsten gegner der deutschen vereine gezogen

9052768 um mich ber den gegner zu informieren werde ich auf jeden fall mit matth us sprechen
9052769 we are working on revisions to the plan of reorganization that would let the company successfully emerge
9052770 if you are not able to timely resolve the funding issues and as a result the pension plans fail the negative consequences will be severe for all of delphis stakeholders
9052771 if both the hourly and salaried plans were to terminate the interests of delphis creditors would be dramatically diluted by pbgcs claim for as much as 8 billion dollars
9052772 gms unwillingness or inability to continue providing delphi with additional liquidity support until completion of our transformation plan may result in us needing to consider disposing or winding down one or more core product lines
9052773 they cant just say you know what were going to re source all these parts to somebody else because theyre so integrated with delphi
9052774 thats the big problem even as gm tries to battle back to health they still have this albatross around their neck

9052778 this represents an increase of 84 5 bed days lost every week in the five cork hospitals
9052779 if it continues cork hospitals will have lost almost 25 000 bed days by the end of the year
9052780 the failure of the fianna f il government to provide suitable aftercare services has resulted in an entirely unsatisfactory situation in terms of patient care
9052781 beds in acute hospitals could be put to better use and the hses budget better spent if more use was made of hse facilities which are currently lying idle such as the abandoned maternity hospitals at st finbarrs and the erinville
9052782 i have met parents who have brought their babies to counties like waterford and kerry to receive the vaccine the fact that babies in cork are denied a vital vaccine solely on the basis of the county in which they were born is totally unacceptable
9052783 the bcg vaccine is administered to newborn babies to prevent tb and a commitment was given that all newborn babies in cork would have access to the vaccine by october 2007 despite this promise almost a year later corks newborn babies do not have access to the vaccine and 10 000 cork babies are now on a waiting list for the tb vaccine
9052784 despite this the government and the hse continue to refuse to accept that a serious problem exists because of their mismanagement and refuse to make resolving this a priority
9052785 this is a great victory for paddy hopkins and the mayo environmental group and for all the groups organisations and individuals who made submissions opposing gold mining in the area
9052786 i have opposed this mining venture from the very beginning because of its impact on the special area of conservation the holy mountain of croagh patrick and because of the possible impact on the ecosystem of the area
9052787 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
9052788 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
9052789 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
9052790 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
9052791 put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
9052792 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

9052795 the people of the cayman islands are important to us and we urge you to take precautionary steps to protect your lives families and property digicel is prepared for the approach of hurricane gustav make sure you are too
9052796 after 2004s hurricane ivan i made sure my own home was hurricane proofed so i dont have too much that i have to do im able to get out and about checking on constituents
9052797 we have made plywood available to cover exposed windows to a number of people over all the districts just about everybody who needed it got at least some
9052798 by this time weve had a lot of experience with these things and a lot of time to get ourselves prepared
9052799 with a full time paid director at the hazard management committee they have done very well
9052800 you can see the difference and they have worked really hard to put together the manuals and the procedures and made sure everyone is aware it has worked really well
9052801 we will of course see what the outcome is tomorrow or whenever it is that the storm is over but a lot of people have been surprised the preparations we have done since four years ago well it shows people how the cayman islands handles these things how we do things here
9052802 ive spoken with ms law and shes obviously still distraught about the loss of eric
9052803 however she is pleased that the school system is accepting responsibility and offering to provide closure to this matter we will have no further comment regarding whether the offer is accepted
9052804 however she is pleased that the school system is accepting responsibility and offering to provide closure to this matter
9052805 he is the governor and while its something youd expect him to do its something he very much wants to do hes coming to touch base with the students and the teachers to voice any concerns they have
9052806 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9052807 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs
9052808 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
9052809 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
9052810 the frequency of high grade storms class 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region has nearly doubled in recent years americas one and only source of production growth could be shut down again and the price impacts would be severe
9052811 its worth noting that the pumas i spoke to over the week unanimously mentioned terrorism when asked why they were sticking with clinton or moving to mccain not choice or economics family leave but terrorism sarah palin doesnt help anyone feel safe from terrorism
9052812 sarah palins name might not help john mccain but her gender might

9052834 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in
9052835 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9052836 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9052837 is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9052838 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9052839 we should all be proud of s historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9052840 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9052841 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9052842 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9052843 since qwest holds a monopoly in many areas they can continue to reduce allowed bandwidth usage as they add new users while not adding new infrastructure such radical bandwidth limitation will have a chilling effect on further evolution of the internet if people cant get bandwidth then they cant use bandwidth intensive services such as youtube and netflix we may never know what the future could have been
9052844 for a long time we thought it was our own private business how we feed ourselves but now we understand there are consequences

9052855 dell talked repeatedly of share gains yet demonstrated a conspicuous absence of profits to show for it
9052856 the quality of the incremental revenue has been called into question
9052857 investors could grow restless if the trends do not begin to exhibit signs of a turnaround in coming quarters
9052858 moreover the company is making solid progress with op ex and should start to see significant progress with product cost of goods sold during the coming 6 12 months
9052859 on pricing we believe dell has already rectified its mistakes
9052860 volatility in pricing could detract from the companys long term cost saving objectives

9052900 six price rises from the big six in just five weeks caps a miserable summer for consumers and highlights just how the companies appear to act in step with each other
9052901 the industry wide shift to higher household energy prices is now complete this is a heavy blow and few households will emerge unscathed or unconcerned about the future affordability of their energy
9052902 consumers should look to pay by direct debit and move to an online plan where possible to get the best available prices
9052903 im sorry weve had to increase our prices and weve made this decision extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment
9052904 there is help available for people who cant afford to pay their bills and we want our customers to get in touch if theyre worried
9052905 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
9052906 although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market

9052911 because there is no general anaesthetic it is much quicker to get over and if you have the procedure on a wednesday youll be back at work on friday
9052912 i think there are more sophisticated forms of liposuction than this vaser liposelection uses ultrasound technology to discriminate between fat cells and surrounding tissues resulting in the exclusive removal of fat cells with minimal damage to surrounding tissues
9052913 most new liposuction technology is aimed at minimising trauma using vibrational techniques
9052914 railroad tracks all day this has been her day at the beach

9052919 research has shown that advanced breast cancers that were not responding to standard chemotherapy treatments had a better response when ixempra was used compared to xeloda alone giving ixempra with xeloda stopped the cancers progression longer
9052920 among patients who took ixempra with xeloda in clinical trials tumors either shrank or did not grow for an average of 5 8 months that was compared to 4 2 months seen for patients taking only xeloda
9052921 that any woman on hrt who is concerned should not stop the treatment immediately she should make a routine appointment with her gp to discuss her particular situation and the risks and benefits of continuing hrt
9052922 i just got a new writing pen a nice fat one that fits in my big mitt pretty good a drive up bank teller was nice enough to give it to me its sure a lot better than the pens i grew up with with the self fed on ink
9052923 now the pens we had in the old zion school were all equipped with a slightly upturned point made of steel and split down the middle from a hole a quarter inch up from the point
9052924 those of us who were lucky enough to have a longhaired girl in the seat ahead of us discovered that little girls hair soaks up quite a bit of ink especially if their hair was braided the trick was to dip their braids without getting caught by the teacher or the victim at least not immediately
9052925 the old time pens were pretty useful for things other than writing too
9052926 honey how did you get that little blue spot on your ass
9052927 ever wonder why the farmers in the early days sat on a stool that did not have two three or four legs but rather one well the answer is simple much of the milking was done in the corral which of course wasnt very level or suited for more than one leg
9052928 that meant you had to hold the milk bucket between your legs and by holding onto the cows tits balance yourself and pull at the same time
9052929 boy when i grew up i found that moving houses was a lot easier than milking a bunch of wild cows by hand
9052930 breast cancer is an understudied and poorly understood disease in the u s hispanic population and we need to understand the magnitude and profile of breast cancer in our latina population
9052931 breast cancer among hispanic and non hispanic white women in arizona

9052936 before the credit crunch struck last year the variable mortgage was 1 8 per cent higher than the official cash rate
9052937 now that global funding costs have increased this margin has reached 2 35 per cent suggesting that even if the cash rate dropped to 5 5 per cent as some are predicting home buyers would still be facing lending rates of more than 7 5 per cent

9052956 it was actually filmed on the last day youre doing seven months with people and coming to an end its always an emotional thing to say goodbye to people especially when you have to say goodbye to them for good to do those scenes was very very hard
9052957 they had a incredible exit they are fabulous characters that will always be remembered theyre legends they are wonderful its a very hard thing to say goodbye to people isnt it
9052958 as far as jack and ianto are concerned they are used to everyone dying young in torchwood its part of the job
9052959 i am very proud of that because it was a very different episode and i think it was a huge diversion from where everybody thought torchwood series 2 was going a huge diversion it anchored gwen again as being human she learned about the dos and donts sometimes never mind how much good you think you are doing actually sometimes its better just to stay in the background thats a big big thing that goes against everything that gwen is sometimes
9052960 you can see another side of jack in how hes been dealing with humans who have been taken by the rift how he described it to gwen was rather beautiful and how he dealt with it was quite cold but thats the only way he could deal with it it was wonderful for the contrast between gwen and jack you could see the time traveller and the human girl from cardiff a beautiful contrast
9052961 i got to shoot nerys hughes of all things you dont do that every day at work do you
9052962 shes bloody wonderwoman she goes home she deals with her lover she has a normal life she goes to work she saves the world every day shes an ordinary girl in an extraordinary situation and shes awesome shes absolutely brilliant im exhausted playing her but she is quite special
9052963 youre done when you get the job done what were doing now hopefully is were putting an end date on that
9052964 were hopefully very close to having that permanently resolved in terms of modifications to the contract
9052965 we certainly want to try to get things in order as quickly as possible
9052966 in february fans started calling themselves privates in the vette nation army
9052967 it has gotten so popular that vickyathome com has never been a better place to visit on the net than it is right now
9052968 i decided to compete with the big boys in adult and add a bunch of new sites to my arsenal of porn ninas site is the first to be added she is such a legend and star that it is only fitting that her site be the first

9052970 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year
9052971 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9052972 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9052973 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9052974 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9052975 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9052976 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9052977 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9052978 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9052979 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9052980 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9052981 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto
9052982 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9052983 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9052984 i think it raises its profile i dont think it changes the steps you go through it is what it is you have to find out what happened
9052985 its a very serious storm and so we are taking it seriously
9052986 and things could change in a moments notice right now the storm is scheduled to land tuesday afternoon but weve seen that change over the hour
9052987 this movie was ok i cant say it was great definately not as good as the first but it is the middle movie in a trilogy
9052988 boring go see it in the cheapo theater for the plane crash
9052989 ignore the fact that this is a woody allen film it is nothing like his other neurotic works it is a great film that goes where you wont expect
9052990 this was a good film a little formulaic at times but enjoyable all the same
9052991 that was the biggest round of my career it was not the front nine i wanted but it was the back nine i needed
9052992 i was playing very well but the greens were ridiculous
9052993 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing
9052994 im not going to smile because martin missed the cut but thats big news
9052995 i gave myself a talking to on the ninth and just tried to stay patient maybe i was trying too hard
9052996 i know its tight and i knew i had to be here at the weekend if i didnt it was pretty much over
9052997 if i can play great i still have a chance
9052998 but youre scared almost with putts of 20 feet or over the scoring is not great and you can make a big move in a short time unfortunately im going to have to rely on some luck on the greens
9052999 i didnt feel quite as good today as i did yesterday but im onto something and feeling good about the game in general

9053008 theres always concern at this time of the year just due to the dry weather and the heat predicted thats why we are very aware of that and ready for these fires at any time
9053009 kind of did some perimeter searches looking for signs of evidence anything else that maybe the suppression crew might have missed when they came in just looking for other things and just trying to identify items of evidence for potential use to tie these things together
9053010 first thing is we want to get it controlled get line all the way around it to prevent the spread and then we will extinguish all of the burning material interior so that there is no threat later

9053012 while she is from alaska she really plays to the ohio the pennsylvania the upper midwest family
9053013 as a republican this is certainly something that should be very exciting
9053014 i think its a good choice young energetic and probably not very controversial
9053015 theres nobody else i could think of who would be better
9053016 i dont know who she is i dont know where they got her from
9053017 i think that is the most dismissive and anti female thing ive ever seen by picking this woman
9053018 its an odd choice but best of luck to him
9053019 he talked about family he talked about where he is coming from and i guess he is in touch with reality
9053020 he seemed to be a little more hard hitting than he normally is and i like that
9053021 i was happy that he was very specific about economics and how hes going to change the economics but i also felt he spoke sincerely to everybody
9053022 he was convincing but like they say theres two sides to a coin and i want to hear john mccains side of his story

9053034 a complaint against dnr for a recently launched state website meant to clarify the issue for voters
9053035 it has become clear to us that the department of natural resources is working hand in hand with the industry and that the state is inappropriately making efforts to influence voters on this ballot initiative
9053036 i did decide to run again for the kittery town council and have taken out my nomination paper
9053037 my decision was guided in part by my desire to help improve the town school budget process and contribute as much as feasible and appropriate to move the frisbee school closing and resulting school re configuration to reality while also retaining frisbee to as a community center town center
9053038 its not just the amount of r amp d a company will do but its location
9053039 if you have different sites which meet most of the criteria and all other factors are equally balanced then the financial environment absolutely will have an impact on the decision
9053040 its irresponsible for us not to take into consideration financial incentives when we decide where to base people
9053041 im current now would you from the goodness of your heart remove those late payments

9053062 our citizens across the country may think that in fact there are no drugs in prison sadly that is not the case
9053063 over the next five years funds up to an amount of 120 million will go towards maintaining and putting in place a zero tolerance policy on drugs
9053064 we have brought up several of our concerns which we see incorporated in this
9053065 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9053066 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9053067 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free
9053068 all we feel is that if we have our questions answered and we have the policemens version we will feel a little bit better
9053069 it still wont bring quilem back but if we have justice then maybe we will feel a little bit better
9053070 if they would have taken the time to use better judgment maybe the situation would have been different
9053071 were asking for a public inquiry to re evaluate the entire situation

9053172 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto

9053183 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9053184 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9053185 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9053186 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9053187 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9053188 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9053189 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9053190 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9053191 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9053192 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento
9053193 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9053194 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
9053195 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9053196 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
9053197 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese

9053200 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9053201 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9053202 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9053203 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9053204 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9053205 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9053206 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9053207 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9053208 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9053209 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9053210 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9053211 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9053212 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9053213 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9053214 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9053215 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9053216 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9053217 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9053218 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9053219 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari

9053223 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
9053224 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
9053225 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
9053226 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa
9053227 sar un presidente ha concluso che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9053228 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9053229 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9053230 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9053231 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9053232 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9053233 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9053234 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9053235 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9053236 the offer was too low and given that new management was brought in the plan is to run the business not to sell it off
9053237 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9053238 no allingresso nel pdl e con il pd dialogo in parlamento

9053240 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9053241 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9053242 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9053243 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9053244 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9053245 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9053246 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9053247 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9053248 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9053249 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9053250 in singapore you cant anyhow say what you want to say to a minister if you say something politically wrong you must have an argument to fall back on just in case the minister shoots a question back at you
9053251 anyone wants to hold a demonstration no views on new media
9053252 so that singapore doesnt become a place where you feel you cannot think cannot say cannot do
9053253 the truth is we want especially the young people to take ownership of singapore
9053254 the space is there for them to ask there is no reason to fear as long as you dont make irresponsible remarks about race or religion there is no issue as far as we are concerned
9053255 this seems to be a generation who are more comfortable with email discussion boards and smses rather than saying something out loud in a group
9053256 given what other accused persons have been dealt with my client and i talked about it and felt that that was a fair and accurate sentence
9053257 because f1 cars are so low any bumps on the road can cause damage to the car and since theres low pressure under the cars travelling at high speeds they will suck up manhole covers not properly fastened
9053258 we also had to shift some pipes below marina boulevard to the side of the road as a precaution to ensure no disruption to water supply in case the pipes had to be repaired
9053259 everything used to be very simple and white white white i wanted to add some colour
9053260 i really liked how it looked as well as its spaciousness
9053261 i liked this piece because i found its design very innovative
9053262 i never thought my home could look this comfortable and modern i really hope to spend more time at home now
9053263 more than 84 000 pack denver broncos home stadium to hear obamas speech
9053264 i have watched almost every game saffc have played this season and they have never once changed their 4 4 2 formation
9053265 so we were surprised when we saw them start with a 4 5 1 formation and when they hit us with an early goal from a set play i think it affected the concentration of some of our younger boys
9053266 if anyone on the pitch has even a quick thought of something other than the match at hand that player is going to cost the team
9053267 it has worked very well for us in the last three matches so we will stick with it probably

9053284 im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans
9053285 unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at top of the ticket
9053286 as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction
9053287 im assuming governor palin agrees with him in his policies
9053288 i think it is one more hit against that glass ceiling and i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate

9053291 we are optimistic that this is going to be a very good clinical trial all our previous trials have yielded positive results

9053299 its difficult to get international competitions as sponsorship is small compared to football which is better known in botswana
9053300 at the world championships we were underdogs out to prove a point this time we want to bring a better ranking so more sponsors will support us
9053301 my target is to win this tournament and im confident we can do it
9053302 we are strong in attack we have a good goal shooter and the girls are very good in movement on the court we try to combine the australian and new zealand style of play which is fast and we dont hold on to the ball too long
9053303 im going to retire after the nations cup so i want to do well
9053304 only five of the players from world championships are in this team because we want the younger players to get more international games for next years world youth netball championships
9053305 use reason to search after truth rather than simply accept the opinion of authorities or be subject to superstition
9053306 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it

9053310 i think it is impossible for him to play for england said the united manager
9053311 this will be his first start and i wont be playing him for the full game he will need a recovery period and therefore it would be very very unlikely that fabio would risk him

9053340 and we all worked at mtv at some point in our lives then eve and alf wanted to form a band i joined and then we got shirley to sing and thats it
9053341 were all night owls we stay up past midnight the marvel bit we got because we thought it sounded good with midnight
9053342 but then again by day were office workers by night were superheroes who play in a band so maybe the comic reference works as well
9053343 as the deadline for the auditions drew near we only had a couple of weeks to go into the studio to record a demo and send it in i was sceptical because everything was done in such a hurry but in the end i was proven wrong
9053344 its great to be on the same bill as the oddfellows and electrico hopefully those who want to see them will come earlier and see us too
9053345 but this will be our first big show well do our best to put up a good show its a very nice platform for the band
9053346 we started as unknowns and now were playing baybeats im sure it will give us more exposure and hopefully we can use this opportunity to let people know more about our band
9053347 we want to go into the studio to record an ep and we want to do more gigs but thats still not confirmed our biggest concern right now is baybeats
9053348 very short and catchy songs itll be very fast and quick but very enjoyable
9053349 we ve heard the warning this isn t about politics over and over in the last few days
9053350 fox news analyst sean hannity praised bush s speech saying i will say anything my leader tells to say
9053351 john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
9053352 for 25 years mccain has opposed a womans right to choose and we know that he will continue to push anti choice policies in the white house mccains pick of anti choice sarah palin is further evidence that his white house will be just another four years of bush style policies any remaining doubts about mccains extreme anti choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti choice records of sarah palin and john mccain
9053353 governors race top contenders meet one last time to debate
9053354 americans are tired of the kind of divisive anti choice policies that sen mccain and gov palin have pledged to continue to support the contrast between pro choice sen obama and anti choice sen mccain is clear voters are looking for a leader who respects womens freedom and privacy barack obama is that leader
9053355 even since the market nearby started its renovations around may this year this group of men moved their gathering and drinking venue to the car park downstairs
9053356 the ban may give parents a false sense of security when the reality is that the 100 websites are merely symbolic
9053357 only in this way can we have a holistic long term sustained approach to dealing with the problem
9053358 with new media expanding so quickly there are bound to be gaps that no group is currently addressing
9053359 its good to be back but it was hard for the team playing with 10 men
9053360 were just building up to the next match it will be a matter of a few matches before all can gel together as a team
9053361 its very common to have musicians playing instruments in dining areas its a small feature but i checked out the website and it was too complicated for me to go through the application process for the nightclub status
9053362 some existing developments that are approved as nightclubs but which appear like pubs and restaurants include wala wala at holland village
9053363 barack is so like bobby with courage caring and charisma senator obama is leading us toward a kinder gentler world
9053364 i havent been playing well all year but in the last two tournaments i finished strongly and this week im playing steady again
9053365 this is my third straight bogey free round including the final round at brunei open last week and its been a good run for me
9053366 after more than 12 years it was only last year when i decided to adopt an aggressive approach and its paying off now
9053367 it proved costly especially with my shots off the tee
9053368 im satisfied but im not too happy with how i was driving the ball today
9053369 i hope to produce two good rounds over the weekend
9053370 the wind picked up in the afternoon which made it tough so it will all depend on the conditions on course
9053371 i wanted a more exclusive environment and i didnt want a mall with heavy traffic but with a lot of window shoppers at millenia walk the shopping environment is more relaxed and leisurely
9053372 my customers at this boutique are mostly oil brokers and private bankers and even they no longer want to look stiff and serious in suits
9053373 has become so important that the government had better take another look at this attitude that they have
9053374 you create antagonistic views and cynicism among the public if you dont do what you said you will do
9053375 the new rules of engagement are going to have a profound effect on the electoral process
9053376 some journalists in australia call theirrecent election the facebook youtube election its a very clear acknowledgement that the new media is an important part of the exercise and how you use it can have a big influence on the vote
9053377 unnecessarily hamper political parties ability to communicate with the electorate
9053378 we will see many more moderates step forward to express their views as it stands now unnecessarily strict laws with regard to political speech result in only a certain activist segment of society daring to speak up
9053379 virtually everyone will not want to go through the legal hassle and will comply
9053380 if we have any more violence we could withdraw the champions league final from rome its not an ultimatum just a message that we are keeping an eye on it
9053381 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
9053382 i will not let the situation go on like this i will deal with it
9053383 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
9053384 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
9053385 there are now up to 3 000 police deployed outside government house
9053386 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
9053387 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
9053388 helped make personal computers as easy to use as telephones changed the way animated films are made persuaded consumers to tune into digital music and refashioned the mobile phone
9053389 no one has epitomized the washington game more than dick durbin
9053390 barack obama talks about needing to change and he is right
9053391 no one has epitomized the washington game more than dick durbin
9053392 socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it
9053393 what happened last saturday was not arsenal and we needed to show it could not happen again
9053394 you take in the criticism but the key is that we knew ourselves we were rubbish and that we could have done so much better now we need to show our real selves
9053395 we knew that we did not put in the needed performance at fulham
9053396 but what happens in between games is not so important the crucial thing is to respond well in the next game which we did
9053397 now we have another big game against newcastle and we need another response to what has happened before
9053398 michael is a very special player he is very important to this club and my vision for it i do not say these things publicly for any other reason than i believe it i know the kind of people you need at a football club you can wait a lifetime for people who can help take it forward and he is one
9053399 zo is de gemeente van afhankelijke zendingspost kind leerling opgegroeid tot zelfstandige kerk volwassen gediplomeerd
9053400 je kunt het jongen help jezelf kom op je bent zelfstandig

9053402 groei groei en nog eens groei dat lijkt h t parool te worden voor onze kerken velen lijken gebiologeerd te zijn door grote aantallen en vooral door groei maar dit woord begint ook velen tegen te staan om verschillende redenen ik noem er een paar
9053403 we hebben van alles en nog wat geprobeerd de gekste dingen gedaan maar niets helpt wat moeten we in vredesnaam nog meer doen
9053404 desempe o equivalente al de f rmacos ya en uso cl nico
9053405 el gran diferencial de las sustancias estudiadas es la baja toxicidad ya que las medicinas disponibles son eficaces pero tiene varios efectos secundarios negativos
9053406 actualmente estamos investigando el mecanismo de acci n espec fica de cada sustancia candidata para poder comprender de qu forma ellas impiden la expansi n del virus demostrada en los experimentos
9053407 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9053408 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9053409 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9053410 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9053411 while her appointment comes as a surprise i am sure governor palin will make a positive contribution to the mccain campaign
9053412 palin brings administrative experience energy and gender diversity to the ticket she also has firsthand knowledge of the importance of energy development which will help keep the focus on this important domestic issue during the campaign
9053413 fills all the holes in mccains r sum it makes sense to put the two of them together
9053414 a new definition of clutter anything that complicates your life and prevents you from living in peace as you live out your purpose
9053415 we simply cannot make room for him jesus when so many other things are in the way
9053416 i have friends and other people i like to go out for dinner with as well as my family im not usually superstitious but they have to sit in the same place and have to order similar kinds of food
9053417 we have concluded that this was a patient that did not need an amputation
9053418 over the past four days teo ser luck myself all the players coaches and key officials of the association have met and im happy to announce categorically that the crisis is over
9053419 yes some mistakes were made there were misunderstandings and some over reactions
9053420 stta president lee bee wah was dedicated to achieving organisational excellence shes very passionate and sometimes a bit impatient to achieve a good system for the players mistakes were made the question is how we respond to it and minimise it how to maintain team unity
9053421 the beijing olympics were very emotional for all of us and i made some comments that were misunderstood and upset some singaporeans i sincerely apologise for any grievances and stress that was caused on behalf of stta coaches and team manager i convey my apologies to singaporeans our actions have dampened the celebrations of all singaporeans i hope this will bring about a closure
9053422 we had discussions about this over the past few days and were all satisfied with the outcome
9053423 for me its over and im focused on getting back to training and competing which is what i do i want to do my best as an athlete
9053424 sports is a reflection of life and there are very few things in life that unify all of us on the same platform there may be criticism about what we have done but the vast majority of singaporeans is happy
9053425 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9053426 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9053427 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9053428 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9053429 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9053430 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9053431 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9053432 who are open to doing something on the production side
9053433 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9053434 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9053435 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9053436 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9053437 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9053438 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9053439 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9053440 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9053441 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9053442 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9053443 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9053444 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9053445 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9053446 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9053447 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9053448 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9053449 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9053450 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9053451 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9053452 we think theres a good chance that they will change the policy in october though not as aggressively as some are expecting
9053453 they might moderate the pace of appreciation not shift to a neutral stance
9053454 they will come up with all kinds of excuses but when caught most of them will choose to settle with the tax department because they know theyre guilty
9053455 its those who try to cover up that we go after were not so keen on the money getting back the unpaid taxes but the publicity
9053456 i asked this guy where he got all the money to buy houses and cars when his income was insufficient to support his spending he told me he had buried british pounds in the ground before the war and now he had dug it up
9053457 he even had the hole to prove to me what proof is that anyone could have dug that hole
9053458 in those days stamp duty was payable for anything above 20 and you would have to fix a six cent stamp on the receipt a check with the postmaster showed that the stamp was issued months after the date on the receipt he would have gotten away with it if not for the stamp
9053459 gone were the rats in the office there was air conditioning more toilets for female staff computerisation and giro to pay your income tax
9053460 with the latest data and text mining technologies and risk profiling research we are able to identify risks areas and develop surveillance systems
9053461 we need to educate the public to cooperate and pay their taxes on time they need to know what their taxes are used for and we can simplify the tax computation further
9053462 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9053463 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9053464 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9053465 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9053466 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9053467 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9053468 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9053469 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9053470 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9053471 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9053472 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9053473 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9053474 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9053475 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9053476 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9053477 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9053478 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9053479 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9053480 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9053481 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9053482 i dont realise yet that i beat theno 1 player in the world
9053483 i dont realise yet that i played on the big court i dont know how im going to sleep tonight
9053484 i was asking myself am i really made to play tennis
9053485 am i going to make the top 100 its not worth playing tennis if you dont make the top 100
9053486 eddie bestand darauf eine zw lfsitzige maschine zu buchen weil er seine privatsph re gewahrt wissen wollte
9053487 aber am ende reisten nur sechs erwachsene im jet weitere seiner freunde buchte er auf einem kommerziellen flug um sicherzugehen dass es ein spa iger urlaub wird
9053488 ich bitte die privatsph re meiner frau und kinder zu respektieren denn wir m chten die angelegenheit als familie bew ltigen
9053489 wenn etwas von meinem essen brig ist packe ich die reste so in den k hlschrank dass sie von den sachen meiner frau m glichst weit weg liegen
9053490 ich lege zettel mit hinweisen wie das ist wills briggebliebenes h hnchen finger weg oder so was dazu wenn meine frau sich doch daran vergreifen sollte raste ich aus
9053491 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9053492 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9053493 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9053494 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9053495 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9053496 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9053497 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9053498 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9053499 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9053500 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9053501 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9053502 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9053503 i started hitting the ball with the forehand and having a lot of winners
9053504 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
9053505 all of us at showtime wish david and his family the best during this very private time
9053506 i also like fiorentina but everyone will finish behind us inter are still the best
9053507 hes the most complete coach ive ever had on the pitch and off it
9053508 hes meticulous about every little detail with us and it seems also with journalists you can see straight away the difference to other coaches now theres a new spirit the team has more confidence in itself
9053509 this was expected as the pace of acquisition of both public and private land sites has slowed in 2008 the government has recognised that the prevailing cautious sentiment and news of financial troubles in other global markets have slowed new acquisition of land
9053510 were definitely very keen to be involved in the youth olympics such as its opening and closing ceremonies
9053511 we brought syogoc officials to our head office in beijing and showed we were involved in the olympics and hope we can share that with the youth games
9053512 ccg were also involved in providing the illustration and visualisation of bogocs beijing olympic games organising committee presentations to the ioc in the lead up to the beijing olympics
9053513 people around the world especially the youth have responded with enthusiasm to this competition and it shows how excited they are about the youth olympics
9053514 political rhetoric cannot contribute to the well being of malaysians nor the economic progress of the nation
9053515 efforts by certain parties to destabilise the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
9053516 responsive to the concerns of the people and has taken measures to lighten the burden of all malaysians particularly the lower income group
9053517 there are sweeteners here and there but it fails to address some fundamental flaws in the economic policies
9053518 our problem is competitiveness it is the failure to attract fdi foreign direct investment and the failure to switch economic policies to become more resilient
9053519 i can sit at my piano for what seems like five minutes but when i look at the clock its three in the morning
9053520 trifle s with piano guitar and a few other things
9053521 so imagine my astonishment when i saw him recently at the limelight looking much like jesus and playing an electronic keyboard tim rice style
9053522 youre putting a gun to peoples heads and you say ok youre marrying this material now learn to love it
9053523 evolved stylistically to the point where we all love it were devoted to it
9053524 ive always been attracted to shows in which people get corrupted by one thing or another or fight against being corrupted morally or ethically
9053525 theres still a significant enough audience out there for this show to survive
9053526 in order to wrest some creative independence from these people you had to fight like hell we did and we won that battle
9053527 i probably got more belligerent than i should have been
9053528 these days show runners are being micromanaged to an extraordinary degree you see seasonal turnover of personnel at unprecedented rates network executives dictate script changes to producers on the telephone its a very difficult environment to work in
9053529 its hard for people to identify with attorneys who represent defendants who the vast majority of whom have done what theyre accused of doing
9053530 many of the crew are taking pay cuts to come and work with us because they believe in what were doing
9053531 the pressures of society create different points of view and attitudes about things
9053532 though bodybuilding has taken some hard knocks recently i will not ponder over the past but will look at the future to help the sport to prosper for our country
9053533 sbas immediate priority will be to focus on the olympics in 2012 the youth olympics here as well as the sea asian and commonwealth games
9053534 we will continue to watch the storm closely and ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate so that we will be ready regardless of what mother nature sends our way
9053535 the key thing is to love our kids and thats not something the government can tell you to do they cant tell you to love your children
9053536 weve been more aware of the problem since 2001 but we still have suicides and to me the ultimate goal is to have no suicides
9053537 we should reinforce the programmes we have now in school and monitor them to see how we can further help the students
9053538 let me say to the people of mississippi this is not a time to panic but it is a time to get prepared
9053539 weve got a bunch of animals and we cant just up and leave them
9053540 this house is pretty strong and i think its stronger now than it ever was before
9053541 the blessing if there is one is that its a three day weekend
9053542 the storm is a long way off people have a lot of time
9053543 the age issue i think was more significant in my career than the gender issue your resume isnt as fat as your opponents that kind of thing
9053544 i dont have 30 years of political experience under my belt but thats a good thing ive never been part of a good ol boys club
9053545 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9053546 they have a lot of chemicals at the plant and they do take great steps to protect them
9053547 i think everything that can be done to protect those chemicals is being done and i think the public at large is safe
9053548 our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these employees during this very difficult time
9053549 this is a very sad day for the institute site family
9053550 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
9053551 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was
9053552 the new orleans area now has the best flood protection in its history
9053553 that should give you an idea of how much work there still is to do
9053554 the politicians get tears in their eyes when they talk about restoring wetlands but at the same time they push this mega levee system to destroy our natural protections
9053555 you can see on that map how we missed our chance this year
9053556 coastal restoration is just one of those things that politicians say like i owe it all to my lovely wife
9053557 meanwhile we keep building up the coast no matter how many times we get hit on the chin at some point the american public is going to stop paying for chin surgery
9053558 im deeply convinced this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community when it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
9053559 i have stopped using a false name and i think all parties should do the same
9053560 your plea is one of not guilty to the indictment as a whole
9053561 everyone was wondering what the prosecutors were doing all these years
9053562 to me honestly this shows the prosecution never believed that karadzic would come to the tribunal one day
9053563 indicated to the airport the possibility of replacing the plane with another
9053564 however in the end it also told the airport control center that it had decided to continue with the plane which is the one that crashed
9053565 democrats dont deserve to win just because republicans deserve to lose
9053566 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz
9053567 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourselves
9053568 she is exactly who i need she is exactly who this country needs to help me fight
9053569 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary clinton left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling
9053570 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet we can shatter that ceiling once and for all
9053571 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9053572 sarah palin is an executive a union member and an expert on energy
9053573 very significantly she is a working mother who understands real life issues the selection of sarah palin is a dramatic and bold decision by sen mccain
9053574 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9053575 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9053576 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9053577 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9053578 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me it has always been my dream to play for this team
9053579 my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9053580 he is me he wore it at georgetown and they can take it down from the rafters and put it on his back
9053581 is a story but its also a platform for ideas i think people like the gossip girl connection the idea of people watching and talking about each other is something thats very real to their lives
9053582 when i first found out what a show runner was i thought it was the strangest job i had heard of in my life
9053583 when someones a writer its very creative and moody and you think of someone walking around the office in pajamas thinking of ideas on the other hand as a television producer you have to be buttoned up organized and a feed the machine type of person the idea that those two creatures were supposed to inhabit the same body was really a strange thing
9053584 when they sent me the books i said ill do this if stephanie does this
9053585 shes really tapped into young women and whats exciting for them i knew the material was a little female weighted for someone as ignorant of the female species as myself and stephanie would have great insight into it
9053586 i was excited it was this world that i loved and felt wasnt represented enough on tv
9053587 there was nothing that had that beautiful romantic woody allen version of new york
9053588 there was so much in the book there were very bold characters and i felt like there was a way to add humanity and dimensionality to them
9053589 when people say the show glamorizes teen drinking and sex they arent really watching the episodes
9053590 not all the characters drink or have sex and when they do its always put in a context behaviors are rooted in character theres decision making regret and consequences involved
9053591 do i wish we got better broadcast ratings yes i wish they gave us more money to make the show
9053592 for us its about how did you matter do people care and do they pay attention to what youre doing i think the show is really succeeding in terms of getting people excited and giving them something to talk about
9053593 before we shot anything she knew i didnt love the way dan looked on the page so she told me dont play to the words on the page
9053594 it was a huge confidence builder to stand in front of 34 21 year olds and explain something to them every day
9053595 to be in a room and have to explain your point of view is a huge skill in hollywood
9053596 its going to focus on putting people both friend wise and romance wise with people you wouldnt necessarily expect
9053597 watching these relationships develop will be very satisfying for the audience
9053598 a cookbook should detail important things like control of fire the colour and smell
9053599 a novice can then appreciate its origin and understand which steps are obligatory and which are variable
9053600 this follows every other technology that turns out to have information of forensic value i think what were seeing is evolutionary
9053601 what were dealing with here is a use of the technology that i dont think the good people at magellan or garmin or tomtom really thought about when they were developing it
9053602 typically the gps data being used is for the purpose of contradicting defendants alibis
9053603 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

9053607 congressional provision of an expressed authority mandate to accomplish statutory goals does not create for the agency a roving commission to achieve those or any other laudable goal by means beyond the authority granted in the statute
9053608 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
9053609 le dan la definitiva base legal y constitucional al decreto supremo no
9053610 eso es lo que se har con este decreto supremo
9053611 por eso este decreto hist rico el 29691 permite retornar a la fuente del soberano principio establecido en el pacto de san jos de costa rica y otorgarle al pueblo la capacidad de decidir si quiere una nueva constituci n pol tica del estado o no la quiere
9053612 el pueblo es el que va decidir no rganos obstruccionistas no grupos de hecho no los palos no patadas el pueblo decidir si quiere o no quiere esta nueva constituci n
9053613 intentar n seguramente utilizar cuanta argucia legal exista cuanta chicana sea posible realizar para evitar el pronunciamiento del pueblo
9053614 como ocurri el 10 de agosto de este a o
9053615 qu de los casos que ya est n tipificados en el c digo penal como la violaci n el intento de homicidio estupro incesto y otros en los cuales en muchas comunidades ind genas las penas y las sanciones son el alejamiento de la comunidad solamente
9053616 a veces hay esquemas de conducta machista que pueden perjudicar los intereses de una mujer en una comunidad incluso en nuestra sociedad est muy mal visto por ejemplo tiene castigo terrible el que una mujer sea infiel pero no sucede as con los hombres
9053617 tenemos 30 planillas de inversi n tenemos presupuesto para completar las obras que est n en ejecuci n las mismas que se deben continuar con su ejecuci n
9053618 es un gran profesional lo reconozco tiene una trayectoria muy limpia y ojal que contin e con este proceso de desarrollo en beneficio del departamento porque las obras quedan las autoridades somos pasajeras
9053619 tengo una absoluta confianza de que va ser una muy buena gesti n porque la paz se lo merece saludo este gesto de transici n ordenada como que es como debe hacerse estas cosas y ahora trabajaremos en pro de nuestro departamento
9053620 but if based on opening my mail this morning i have learned that the taxes are going to increase by 40
9053621 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9053622 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9053623 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9053624 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9053625 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9053626 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9053627 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9053628 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9053629 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9053630 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9053631 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9053632 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9053633 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9053634 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9053635 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9053636 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9053637 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9053638 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9053639 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9053640 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9053641 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9053642 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9053643 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9053644 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9053645 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9053646 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9053647 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9053648 advertisers spend good money to create that mail then they pay to have me deliver it and then you dont even have the decency to read it after all the time and trouble they went through youve got a lot of nerve just tearing it up and throwing it away right in front of my face you have zero manners zero
9053649 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9053650 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9053651 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9053652 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9053653 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9053654 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9053655 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9053656 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9053657 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9053658 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9053659 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9053660 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9053661 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9053662 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9053663 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9053664 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9053665 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9053666 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9053667 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9053668 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9053669 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9053670 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9053671 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9053672 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9053673 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9053674 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9053675 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9053676 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9053677 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9053678 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9053679 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9053680 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9053681 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9053682 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9053683 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9053684 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9053685 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9053686 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9053687 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9053688 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9053689 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9053690 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9053691 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

9053693 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9053694 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9053695 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9053696 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9053697 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9053698 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9053699 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is

9053702 boasts the purest of disney raptures it unites the generations rather than driving them apart
9053703 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9053704 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9053705 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9053706 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9053707 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9053708 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9053709 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9053710 no one works for someone we all just work together
9053711 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9053712 i think this says that america in the 21st century is much different than america in the 20th century
9053713 are now being realized in all areas of american life even the highest levels of elective office the presidency and vice presidency
9053714 the pipeline of potential national candidates is up and gubernatorial candidates are up
9053715 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling
9053716 theyve become very good candidates but they dont run differently from other candidates they go negative at just about the same rates near as we can tell theyre just as tough
9053717 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9053718 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9053719 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre going to be as impressed as i am
9053720 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9053721 i thank you sen mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence you have placed in me
9053722 senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate
9053723 i was hoping for her but i was very surprised
9053724 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9053725 i actually didnt know who she was but im very excited now
9053726 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9053727 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9053728 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9053729 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9053730 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9053731 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9053732 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9053733 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9053734 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9053735 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9053736 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9053737 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9053738 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9053739 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9053740 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9053741 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9053742 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9053743 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9053744 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9053745 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9053746 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9053747 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9053748 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9053749 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9053750 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9053751 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9053752 heading into a budget cycle that could be upside down by as much as a billion dollars oregonians need a strong rainy day fund that will protect our classrooms police and elderly
9053753 unfortunately the rainy day fund adopted last session seems to be full of holes and this budget cycles contribution has dwindled to a paltry 23 8 million oregonians deserve a stronger safety net
9053754 a principle of smart personal finance says pay yourself first meaning put money into savings for emergencies when you get paid before you start paying bills and buying flat screen tvs
9053755 unfortunately for oregonians democrats decided we should spend first and save for our future last now we are looking at empty pocketbooks and hefty bills
9053756 there is no new contract involved in what is a service upgrade at the same time the ap will be working with the spokesman review and other papers to help resolve concerns they may have during the rollout of the new member choice packaging and pricing plan which will provide newspaper members with greatly expanded basic news coverage
9053757 will not be executing a new contract reflecting the changes as required by the ap in the new member choice program the new contractual arrangement represents a continued and material shift by the ap of separating services from the basic package so that some services will be available only by signing up for supplemental programs thus ap services that formerly were part of a basic plan will now only be available through a supplemental plan approach this dilutes the value of the basic breaking news plan and constitutes a material change in the quality and breadth of the services offered by the ap under the basic contract
9053758 on that basis the old contract will expire dec 31 and well not sign a new one in a sense its not a cancellation at all but a decision to decline signing any new contracts
9053759 not a hostile gesture by any means its the beginning of an assessment of our business model not the end
9053760 we are not giving out any specifics on her character
9053761 whoah there is no way thats what the author intended even though thats the only valid way to read what the question says we should actually alter the question to what he really meant plane stationary and then ask
9053762 you are assuming that the speed of the plane is measured by the wheels and there is nothing that says that
9053763 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9053764 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9053765 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9053766 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9053767 can this conveyor prevent the plane from reaching takeoff speed

9053771 mientras en el pa s la gran mayor a estamos apasionadamente debatiendo el tema de la constituci n entre ellos el tema del aborto del matrimonio gay y el r gimen de transici n aqu hay otro r gimen de transici n hasta el 28 de septiembre el d a en que vamos a votar no s nulo o abstenernos hasta el 28 de septiembre al parecer hay un impacto que no se visibiliza pero que se siente con las grandes compa as trasnacionales de este gobierno para negociar renegociar y adjudicar los grandes contratos millonarios en explotaci n de recursos naturales
9053772 en el art culo 8 del proyecto de constituci n condenar a y obligar a a las personas que explotan recursos naturales a participar en un cincuenta por ciento por lo menos de lo que reciban entonces aqu hay algo perverso cual es la urgencia del gobierno de rafael correa para entregar a dedo millonarios contratos
9053773 primero en el contrato de porta celular no pod an esperar un poco para despu s de aprobada la constituci n ver con qu nuevo marco jur dico y constitucional trabajar ellos pod an extender el contrato un mes o dos meses por responsabilidad hasta que se apruebe la nueva constituci n
9053774 ese contrato es nulo y perjudicial para el pa s porque no solo se firm o se renegoci el contrato de 850 mhz sino que se le adjudic la
9053775 primero se entrega a dedo la s smica en el golfo y se entrega a enap de chile y a pdvesa de venezuela la explotaci n de gas en el golfo a dedo porque no hay licitaci n y es lo b sico en el sector p blico la emergencia en petroecuador es injustificada e ilegal se adjudica a dedo para qu est el proceso licitatorio es para poder calificar y medir las ofertas t cnicas y econ micas
9053776 las joyas de la corona sacha auca shushufindi libertador y coronaco el presidente dispone entregar firmemente los contratos sacha dice no le toquen porque ya esta entregado a pdvesa y van a entregar a trav s de una empresa de econom a mixta que no est en la ley
9053777 la empresa r o napo que va a conformarse en una empresa de papel entre petroecuador y pdvesa para explotar un campo en producci n para m es humillante ver las declaraciones en ecuadorinmediato del ministro de minas estamos entregando un campo en producci n con 45 mil barriles por d a 500 millones de barriles de reservas de crudo liviano 50 mil millones de d lares en reservas y de eso le damos el 30 a una compa a de papel de venezuela son 15 mil millones de d lares a cambio de una inversi n anual de 24 millones de d lares
9053778 los otros campos de las joyas de la corona se lo van a entregar a schlumberger y a halliburton
9053779 yo tengo documentos habr tiempo para revelar como desde la presidencia de la rep blica se habr a inducido a que se entregue el campo auca a la compa a schlumberger
9053780 es una resoluci n del directorio la funcionario de la presidencia la se orita sandra naranjo hace una exposici n y reclama al directorio por qu no han cumplido esto con base a eso el directorio se mueve y toma una resoluci n
9053781 entregan las joyas de la corona est en proceso por eso quiero advertir y muchos sectores estamos en eso este procedimiento es ilegal las autoridades de petroecuador que suscriban estos contratos alg n momento aqu se recuperara el estado de derecho las autoridades que firmen los informes y contratos est n incurriendo en delitos civiles y penales
9053782 si el presidente de petroecuador firma los contratos bajo una modalidad que no existe en la ley de hidrocarburos el contrato de obras y bienes espec ficos estar a incurriendo en un delito m s temprano que tarde recuperamos el derecho y correa no estar todo el tiempo en el pa s
9053783 la ley de hidrocarburos se ala que en nico organismo responsable para facilitar estos proyectos es el comit especial de licitaciones integrado por ministro de minas la ministra de econom a y finanzas y el ministro de defensa es el sel que tiene que elegir la licitaci n fuera de petroecuador
9053784 yo tengo un mail del ex presidente fernando zurita en donde dice que denuncie que el se or jos luis serit representante del presidente correa en el directorio presionaba para que se divida al campo pungarayacu en dos uno para ivanhoe y otra para otra empresa canadiense y dice que el presidente correa dispuso que sea solo para ivanhoe
9053785 mejorar el crudo de pungarayacu es terrible los niveles de contaminaci n son insoportables y alt simos es un crudo extremadamente pesado
9053786 entregan oglan a enarsa una empresa de papel nunca han perforado un pozo son empresas de papel atr s de la empresa de papel est n empresas privadas argentinas como el caso de coca codo sinclair
9053787 uno de los elementos y las causales del desastre del proyecto san francisco es que los estudios con los que se construy y con los que se va a construir coca codo sinclair fueron hechos por el ex inecel
9053788 se tomaron los estudios cuando no hab an explotado el volc n tungurahua
9053789 pero que le permite adjudicar a dedo a coca codo sinclair porque hidropichincha es s a y no se sujeta a los procedimiento contractuales del estado
9053790 a trav s de petroamazonas se piensa adjudicar el m s grande proyecto de crudos pesados del pa s que se llama itt a petrobras
9053791 en ese sentido creo que el esfuerzo de esta administraci n va justamente enfocado a que podamos mejorar la calidad considerando que todos quienes van a ser parte del magisterio cumplan con un m nimo de caracter sticas y un m nimo de calidad para poder atender en los servicios educativos
9053792 porque hay plazas de todo el proceso de jubilaci n es decir en estos pr ximos meses se incorporan al magisterio 20 mil nuevas personas
9053793 hubo una prueba de razonamiento l gico y verbal hubo una prueba de conocimientos generales una tercera prueba de conocimientos espec ficos de acuerdo a la materia que aplicaba cada uno de los aspirantes a docentes y justamente en el mes de septiembre estamos cerrando el proceso de evaluaci n con las clases demostrativas
9053794 esto es la parte pr ctica donde el aspirante a docente puede demostrar ante la comunidad educativa cu les son sus destrezas pedag gicas
9053795 justamente en lo que es l gica matem tica y lenguaje y yo creo que una vez que se publiquen los resultados vamos a darnos cuentas que si quienes estamos como docentes tenemos debilidad en estas reas obviamente esto repercute en la calidad de educaci n que tienen los ni os porque los ni os tambi n denotan esas mismas debilidades una vez que son evaluados
9053796 el mes de septiembre es como un mes de innovaciones pedag gicas donde todos estos aspirantes a docentes est n utilizando sus mayores capacidades para ingresar al magisterio porque obviamente va a ser una evaluaci n la idea es que en cada establecimiento educativo en donde se han asignado partidas el director que es quien preside el jurado de la comunidad educativa organice todas sus clases demostrativas de forma de todos los estudiantes puedan de cierta forma participar en este proceso de la clase demostrativa pero adem s yo creo que lo m s interesante de este proceso es que quienes participan son la comunidad educativa por ello se establece que es el jurado de la comunidad educativa quien califica esta parte del proceso
9053797 para nosotros esta es una forma de transparentar los resultados que no exista ninguna interferencia ninguna subjetividad en la calificaci n

9053799 while the sandwich has been offered over the years in a number of u s markets this will be the first time we have rolled it out nationally

9053817 the four night democratic convention ranks as the most watched convention of either party democratic or republican since nielsen began measuring conventions in 1960
9053818 obamas audience might be higher since nielsen didnt have an estimate for how many people watched obama on pbs or c span thursday night
9053819 haneef has been exonerated by the australian court and even the uk investigators are not keen on pursuing investigation against him he arrived through mumbai and might have made his exit from there itself

9053864 i think they must have polling numbers that show hillary clinton voters are not satisfied with barack obama and they hope to reign them in

9053901 i referred the sentences given to these three offenders to the court of appeal because i considered that the sentences did not properly reflect the seriousness of the offences the need to punish the offenders and the need to deter others from such serious conduct
9053902 falls outside the range of sentences which the judge applying his mind to all the relevant factors could reasonably consider appropriate
9053903 referring a sentence as unduly lenient should not be interpreted as a public criticism of the judge in the case
9053904 this information shows that from time to time sentencing decisions are made which the court of appeal considers are wrong accordingly they are corrected
9053905 not every successful appeal to the court of appeal involves criticism of the trial judge
9053906 falls outside the range of sentences which the judge applying his mind to all the relevant factors could reasonably consider appropriate
9053907 the tables are published annually and give factual information on the sentences the law officers referred to the court of appeal as unduly lenient
9053908 the information is already in the public domain as all court of appeal hearings are open to the public
9053909 referring a sentence as unduly lenient should not be interpreted as a public criticism of the judge in the case

9053912 from the bottom of my heart i would like to thank everyone for everything that has happened over the last year my birthday this year was incredibly special as always i had the opportunity to spend it with my family which has always meant the world to me over the course of my few weeks home i was met with surprises that kept coming and coming everyday it was something new and something special i never would have thought that there were so many people who cared so much and for that i thank all of you i have recieved gifts and letters both of equal sentimental value some of the gifts have been quite amazing and some yes a little too generous but thank you the letters and cards also hold such fond memories for me as simple words can hold such heartfelt power and were indeed very moving so thank you very much this past year has been something else its opened my eyes to many things and many people its had its ups and downs and ins and outs and i believe weve all been able to take something from that and grow in our own imparticular ways weve over come obstacles and set in motion opportunities that can change our own individual lives id like to thank everyone so much for being part of this big picture for me you are all very special thank you all sincerely kyle schmid ps thank you for all the fond memories especially for the ones bound and sealed
9053913 here lived a great streetsweeper who did his job well

9053917 vulnera los derechos de sus empleadas imponiendo turnos y jornadas m s largos de los estipulados y obligando al personal a ejercer adem s de sus funciones las que corresponden a otras categor as
9053918 nos encontramos con que una sola trabajadora debe limpiar todo el hospital durante su turno una carga absolutamente desproporcionada
9053919 perjuicio para las trabajadoras que solicitan reiteradamente reuniones con la empresa y reclaman el cumplimiento de su convenio obteniendo el silencio por respuesta
9053920 el importante riesgo para la salud que supone que el personal de limpieza est siendo obligado a desempe ar funciones que le corresponden a los auxiliares cl nicos y a ocuparse de todas las salas tanto de las habitaciones como de los quir fanos incluidos los diversos aparatos as como del paritorio y dem s dependencias lo que incide tambi n en la calidad del servicio que se ofrece en el hospital
9053921 alterar los turnos nocturnos y endurecer las condiciones de los trabajadores en una maniobra de persecuci n sindical
9053922 hasta el momento se alternaban dos trabajadoras una noche cada una sin embargo la empresa ha anunciado que a partir de ahora una trabajadora deber cubrir todas las noches de lunes a viernes infringiendo abiertamente la normativa vigente
9053923 es un servicio contratado a una empresa pero como es un problema que puede afectar al hospital queremos saber qu ocurre por lo que ma ana por hoy me reunir con la presidenta del comit de empresas olga riverol para conocer en profundidad la denuncia tambi n hemos solicitado informaci n a la propia empresa
9053924 el resultado de todo esto es un reflejo de la situaci n social del pa s para ello se deben tomar acciones urgentes de prevenci n tanto en las familias como en las escuelas y los sistemas de control deben actuar
9053925 vivir a costa de los subsidios ya no es una opci n
9053926 la combinaci n nefasta de pobres pol ticas sociales y circunstancias econ micas injustas est matando a la gente a gran escala
9053927 los investigadores han asumido que el asma no es una complicaci n de la infecci n pedi trica de vih porque los estudios realizados antes de la aparici n de la haart a mediados de los 90 no detectaban el problema
9053928 el aumento de la incidencia del asma se registr a partir de la era de la haart que restableci los niveles de c lulas t
9053929 se trata de rituximab un anticuerpo monoclonal que recluta las defensas naturales del organismo para atacar y eliminar las c lulas afectadas aquellas que est n sanas se regeneran despu s del tratamiento y recuperan sus niveles normales en varios meses es importante destacar que este tratamiento no da a al sistema inmunol gico
9053930 desempe o equivalente al de f rmacos ya en uso cl nico
9053931 el gran diferencial de las sustancias estudiadas es la baja toxicidad ya que las medicinas disponibles son eficaces pero tiene varios efectos secundarios negativos
9053932 actualmente estamos investigando el mecanismo de acci n espec fica de cada sustancia candidata para poder comprender de qu forma ellas impiden la expansi n del virus demostrada en los experimentos
9053933 la gratuidad era una de nuestras principales preocupaciones y ahora contamos con la financiaci n para comprar tratamientos antirretrovirales
9053934 aunque tengamos disponibilidad de plazas no hay personal m dico para cubrir las necesidades
9053935 lamentablemente en el pa s es dif cil tener una preparaci n completa nosotros le hemos planteado a las autoridades de salud que otorguen becas a los estudiantes que est n saliendo de las especialidades b sicas para que saquen una subespecialidad y que se comprometan que al regresar trabajar n por varios a os en los hospitales del pa s
9053936 hay subespecialidades que se pueden desarrollar en el pa s como endocrinolog a reumatolog a infectolog a cuidados intensivos y salud familiar pero se requiere que las personas a cargo de las universidades se sienten a trabajar con el ministerio de salud
9053937 muchos se van a estudiar subespecialidades que no necesita el pa s
9053938 no ser a arriesgado pensar que aparezcan entre 10 y 25 casos
9053939 no ser a arriesgado pensar que se den entre 10 y 25 casos
9053940 de confirmarse ser a algo ins lito en el mundo
9053941 no est confirmado y hay muchas patolog as neurol gicas
9053942 el sida no es un problema exclusivo de salud p blica es econ mico y social no es tarea f cil escoger quienes saldr n favorecidos porque es obvio que todos tienen necesidades
9053943 vemos que esto permite hablar de una atenci n m s integral dijo miranda pero esperamos que se llegue a cubrir a m s personas que est n necesitadas
9053944 este programa pretende no ser asistencialista mas bien busca dar apoyo a las personas que de manera comprobada est n en condiciones extremas y que cumplen su tratamiento
9053945 esto se ve muy serio hay viento lluvia caen rboles y no tenemos electriidad
9053946 algunos experimentos han puesto de manifiesto las ventajas de estos dispositivos para cosas como el reconocimiento de fotograf as
9053947 en la comunidad de los servicios de inteligencia hay muy pocas personas que comprenden la ciencia y sin ella ser imposible predecir sorpresas esto es un agujero negro que ha de ser rellenado con luz
9053948 no quiere decir que vayamos a ser capaces de leer la mente de alguien a distancia pero s podremos detectar grandes cambios en su ansiedad o en su miedo

9053950 barack obama talks about needing to change and he is right
9053951 occasions when people in the uk would wish that those in responsible positions in the us might listen and learn from our experiences
9053952 if you are looking at colonialism if you are looking at operations on an international scale if you are looking at understanding each others culture understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign we have been through them all
9053953 weve won some lost some drawn some the fact is there is quite a lot of experience over here which is valid and should be listened to
9053954 why didnt anyone listen to what was said and the advice that was given
9053955 its not as if we had been forcing that across the atlantic
9053956 in the days following the victory of 9 april 2003 no one it seems to me was instructed to put the security of iraq first to put law and order on the streets first there was no police force there was no constituted army except the victorious invaders
9053957 and there was no american general that i could establish who was given the accountable responsibility to make sure that the first duty of any government and we were the government was to keep law and order on the streets
9053958 neither the british government in 1917 nor the coalition in 2003 really understood what they were taking on when they assumed control of baghdad
9053959 barack obama talks about needing to change and he is right
9053960 a football banning order was granted in respect of mr angus as a result of intelligence surrounding his activities with other individuals affiliating themselves with hibernian fc
9053961 the conditions of the football banning order are that he is banned from every football ground in the uk for the next three years and that he is required to surrender his passport whenever hibernian fc travel abroad
9053962 however there is no requirement for him to surrender his passport should he choose to travel abroad with another club
9053963 he is a jambo and always has been his mates went to the hibs game so paul decided to just sit in the pub and catch up with them after the game
9053964 when he met them later he got caught up in a fight at falkirk station which ultimately led to his banning order
9053965 the individual concerned is one of a small minority who continue their attempts to tarnish the otherwise good record of hibernian supporters
9053966 the club is fully supportive of the application made by lothian and borders police and welcomes the outcome
9053967 i have had a few women tell me that they might have mixed feelings about palin because it wouldnt be fair that
9053968 im still not clear where she stands on the issue of womens reproductive freedom
9053969 lady penelope you dont know completely what youre talking about so id suggest talking about it less
9053970 and should they make the mistake of going after her that way you can be damned sure her party will take it to the streets unlike the assholes in ours who just stood there with their thumbs up their butts
9053971 if cnn is so concerned about folks having too many children then she should check out the breeding record of the kennedy family
9053972 hi this is nancy yeah fine thanks i want to run a scenario by you lets say that the president of the united states dies peacefully in his sleep after a long happy life the vice president happens to be pregnant and goes into to labor at the exact same time
9053973 while obama was out working as a community organizer and writing another book about himself the little lady sarah palin was at home making babies
9053974 let a democrat say that an executive with 2 years of experience and no foreign policy expertise isnt ready for the presidency oh pretty please because you know what im going to do im going to take that soundbite put it in an ad slap obamas mug up there and run it over and over and over again

9053977 come mothers and fathers throughout the land and dont criticize what you cant understand your sons and your daughters are beyond your command your old road is rapidly agin please get out of the new one if you cant lend your hand for the times they are a changin
9053978 obama may not be the best person for the job
9053979 its wrong to put such an inexperienced woman on the ticket if youre going to put someone with no experience on they need to have the most important qualification of them all
9053980 a woman who isnt ready to serve will set women back a generation at least
9053981 i think her selection would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
9053982 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful
9053983 she is more like you and i than anyone who has held this office in over a century
9053984 im sure america is ready to have the person a heartbeat away from the presidency have a 4 month old downs syndrome infant there are also other young kids and no i dont think mothers shouldnt be veeps but cmon anybody who knows about developmentally disabled kids knows the amount of early intervention needed
9053985 i just dont understand this pick i mean what does she possibly bring to the ticket

9054022 we have serious reasons to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy if this is confirmed we will have grounds to suspect that somebody in the u s has created this conflict to aggravate the situation and create a competitive advantage for one of the presidential candidates
9054023 as far as the perception of these events by the general public goes it depends not only on politicians but also on how artful they are in controlling the mass media and our american colleagues do this much better than we do and theres a lot we can learn from them

9054052 we do spend a lot of time with saturation patrols and highway patrol does checkpoints and i think this is validation that those do work and reduce the number of fatalities we have
9054053 we have not had any alcohol related fatalities so far this year and were very pleased with that
9054054 the fact that we remember so few of our dreams a few per cent at best argues against any function for dreams if they are so important why dont we remember more of them if dreams are important why arent the recallers of them better off in some way
9054055 we are thinking creatures because thinking is a valuable adaptation but that doesnt mean that all forms of thinking have a function dreams at this moment in the collective findings of dream researchers seem to be a throwaway production an offhand story to while the night away
9054056 the findings from this search raise the general question why is thinking about sexuality more pervasive in waking thought than it appears to be in dreaming
9054057 although dreams and sexuality are often closely related in popular culture perhaps in part due to freuds theory concerning the hidden sexual meanings said to be present in most dreams studies suggest that there is little explicit sexual content in dreams
9054058 the hypothesis is that the biological function of dreaming is to simulate threatening events and to rehearse threat perception and threat avoidance says dr antti revonsuo a psychologist at the university of turku
9054059 in the ancestral environment human life was short and full of threats a dream production mechanism that tends to select threatening waking events and simulate them over and over again would have been valuable for the development of threat avoiding skills
9054060 people who obsessively record their dreams probably are not normal dreamers most normal dreamers dont remember dreams because they are junk basically most dreams last for 20 minutes or longer so recall is often of the distorted end of the dream he says
9054061 they are the cinema of the mind where the brain creates junk b movies that are entertaining but which mean little and arebest forgotten

9054071 organic law of the reordering of the internal market of liquid fuels
9054072 this has a negative psychological effect on the end consumer who at the time of deciding who is to blame points at pdvsa and therefore at the national government
9054073 doesnt have any negative implications for the service stations only that now were going to guarantee that these installations are in excellent condition that they have bathrooms and function during night hours in order to guarantee good public service for our people
9054074 the law does not provide for the forcible transfer of these outlets to the communal councils an aspiration of the bolivarian government is that these popular organizations have an important participation in this activity this change would be progressive and one of the alternatives being studied is the transfer of the administration of new service stations or of some of those that are already property of the state

9054105 we touched a lot of balls with our block today
9054106 i feel like we controlled them defensively which was a bright spot for us
9054107 we were able to test out some things weve been working on and get all of our active players some playing time and experience which will only help us down the line

9054131 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
9054132 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
9054133 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
9054134 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
9054135 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
9054136 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
9054137 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
9054138 the fact that shes a woman shes a governor that will attract some other women they are hoping to bring in to the republican party that may be disaffected after hillary clinton didnt win the nomination for the democratic party

9054152 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9054153 we played awful defense and awful special teams and we deserved to lose
9054154 thats it in a nutshell we had over 400 yards we deserved to win the football game offensively we didnt deserve anything on defense we didnt tackle we didnt pass rush we didnt do anything defensively
9054155 you saw it coming whoever had that ball last was probably going to end up winning the darn thing
9054156 our sophomore quarterback i give him credit he completed some good passes and chad allemon that was a great catch and run
9054157 god knows we had to make it an issue and let them drive down there
9054158 our guys played super hard hard as can be but theyre not playing super smart right now
9054159 hopefully if my guys learn how to tackle well beat some teams but thats a big if right now
9054160 this is a great group of kids i love them to death but they just dont get it right now
9054161 we had eight guys returning on offense and it was probably obvious that we were probably a little more in sync on offense
9054162 defensively were learning under fire the great thing is though we have an offense that can hopefully bail us out at times and theyre going to have carry the load for the first few weeks theres no doubt about that but what theyre going to do is buy us time to get better and they did that

9054195 we need to strengthen our partnerships we need to work better with new donors that are coming in and we need to do this through new ideas
9054196 we need to increase the transparency of aid and be more accountable for outcomes
9054197 to coordinate better we need new instruments and we need to pool funds

9054250 me resulta altamente incomprensible la fina sensibilidad que exhiben los concejales rosarinos en todo lo referente a la protecci n de los animales casos animales de tiro caso de los can dromos y a la par la extrema falta de sensibilidad e indiferencia ante la tortura de un ser humano totalmente indefenso e inocente pues bien se sabe que el aborto de un ser humano est precedido de la tortura de ese mismo ser humano
9054251 sin comprometer al directorio que a n no se ha expedido al respecto
9054252 rindo un caluroso homenaje a los concejales jorge boasso luisa donni y osvaldo miatello que votaron en contra de esa declaraci n por su evidente inconstitucionalidad

9054255 during the season last year there were times when jaque struggled and bec was still producing so i expect she will pick up where she left off
9054256 shes got a great mind for the game and is very competitive even though shes not real big she plays like she is so i expect bec will be very strong for us this year
9054257 sam had a great spring and had a chance to play a lot and build up her confidence
9054258 i think this will be a good time for sam to break out she has always been in the shadows a little bit but in the spring we had a couple of injuries so sam ended up playing quite a bit and ended up being the go to hitter for the returning players
9054259 by us putting the ball toward the center of the court we forced emily tooker to set outside more that even she would have like to

9054276 were having a number of problems in all supermarkets at the moment
9054277 it seems to have worked but what tends to happen is the thieves go down the road and start stealing from another market
9054278 well since he was jewish why dont we investigate so and so because after all since he was a jew the investigation gets special treatment

9054280 that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed
9054281 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9054282 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colours obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9054283 witten can be a third receiver obviously hes a force as a pass receiver
9054284 theres no reason you cant give it a colts look where youve got witten in the slot like they do with dallas clark wittens a force out there so he can be a third receiver if we need him too
9054285 i think its good it gets a good response from the businesses in the downtown area
9054286 you project your budget for that year how much youre going to spend and then prices go up the way they have and youre over budget
9054287 its nice to have them in the community just riding around you can see them i love it
9054288 ive asked all departments to take a look at their fuel costs and how they might reduce them
9054289 you christians are trying to convert our people to christianity
9054290 you christians are trying to convert our people to christianity
9054291 you think when im playing a match im thinking of what to say to you guys
9054292 im thinking what they are going to tell me because i had like five match points and i havent made them what are they going to tell me of course not
9054293 in the first set i was serving quite well and holding my serves and doing quite well
9054294 then in the second set i dont know what happened i just lost my rhythm throughout the whole match i had a really bad percentage of first serves and mainly playing with second serves which didnt help
9054295 but then somehow i lost the timing in the second set because maybe i got a little tired and then when you dont use your legs you dont accelerate as much with your arms and the strokes fall apart
9054296 im in the lower side of the draw so i really dont have anything to do with the top side
9054297 for me it doesnt make a difference until if i go to the finals we are complete on two different sides so i follow my own side of the draw
9054298 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9054299 we send our congratulations to governor palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president her selection is yet another encouraging sign that all barriers are falling in our politics and while we obviously have differences over how to best lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9054300 you know i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story
9054301 and you know im sure that she will hlp make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him in his policies but the fact that shes been nominated i think or soon will be nominated i think is one more indicator of this country moving forwad the fat that youve got a woman as the nominee of one of the as the vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against the glass ceiling and i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9054302 you know i think that you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and that statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9054303 a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail

9054306 many americans today either avoid this term eskimo or feel uneasy using it
9054307 yupik speakers say were yupik eskimos our relatives in northern alaska canada and greenland are inuit eskimos they arent yupik and we arent inuit but were all eskimos
9054308 while use of these terms inuit and yupik is often preferable when speaking of the appropriate linguistic group none of them can be used of the eskimoan peoples as a whole the only inclusive term remains eskimo
9054309 the admission of the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial to mr satterfields claim of innocence
9054310 mr satterfields statements were not volunteered spontaneous and or freely made without coercion from promise inducement or hope of reward
9054311 a coerced confession should not be admitted in evidence because of its inherent lack of reliability
9054312 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life
9054313 playing in an old firm game is very special especially the two within ten days at parkhead were very good for us
9054314 and when jan scored the last minute winner to make it 2 1 it gave us a bit of momentum and that managed to carry us through to winning the league
9054315 and if you manage to win the first old firm game of the season it sometimes gives you a bit of an edge
9054316 every game is important obviously old firm games have that extra edge to them and obviously results between the two teams throughout the season can have a bearing on the league title
9054317 i think now we have a strong squad probably stronger than last year at the minute so hopefully we can do the business and obviously surprise celtic
9054318 i think we are pretty much the same and rangers have made a lot of new signings and weve brought a few in so we know it will be a very difficult season again
9054319 i would say his physical presence and confidence and definitely his technical ability in making great saves you know making saves that other goalkeepers might not make he can pluck them out of the air
9054320 whether its the top corner or down below hes got a fantastic stretch on him
9054321 one of the big things about celtic or rangers goalkeepers for that matter is that you have got to put up with periods of time that you dont have a lot to do so that composure and that focus to the job in hand is something that you have to keep working at
9054322 hes done it quite well but there is times when he maybe just loses that a little bit and that is something that as he matures and gets more experienced he will definitely definitely get better
9054323 he makes right good saves he can be the difference at times and you can count the mistakes in one hand over the course of the season
9054324 he is quick around the area which you need to be and hes brave
9054325 you have got to have broad shoulders because if you do make a mistake you have to got to carry on and dont let the people get at you
9054326 you need to read situations very well and i think allan has got that ingredient hes sharp has good agility and commands the area more each time he plays and that comes with confidence and feeling at home in that position
9054327 its all about consistency really the more consistent you can be with pulling a match winning save i think thats what puts you at the top of the pile
9054328 it doesnt get more american than ogling a british lingerie model katie downes walking the streets of ole london town
9054329 i was really enjoying that too bad you had to stop
9054330 i cant go yet babe gotta wait til this goes down
9054331 thanks for taking me to the movie i really enjoyed it
9054332 i really liked the scene where she reached into her blouse to touch her breasts then moved her hand between her legs
9054333 and i loved the scene where they made love in the clock tower
9054334 yeah and i thought the kitchen scene where he fed her the food blindfolded was very cool
9054335 lauren baby i want you so bad youre so beautiful youre body is so incredible and youre turning me on like you wouldnt believe
9054336 i want you too james i really want you i need you fuck me please
9054337 take off your shorts james i want to see you too
9054338 really your pussy looks like a flower with lovely petals inviting
9054339 father i have told you that i have far too much to do keeping the men and horses ready for battle to bother with such trivial things and i wish you would not concern yourself where these private matters are concerned
9054340 my son have you even lain with a woman yet felt her warm sheath gripping you heard her breathless sigh as you entered her
9054341 of course i have im nearly three decades old ive been carrying on with various servants since i was a teen my sexual prowess is not at issue here i will not do what you ask not today not tomorrow and very likely not ever
9054342 he gripped my hand and gently pulled me to a basin of cool water near the sink
9054343 did you hear any of the conversation i was just having with rian
9054344 yes but only parts hardly enough to make sense of it
9054345 you want rian to to be with a woman in that that way
9054346 you have excellent hearing but you obviously did not hear the whole of the conversation i offered him your virginity but he says hes too busy to take it
9054347 rian is too much like me concerned with everything but himself i know he has had trysts in the past the men around here keep me informed but it has been months since he has been with anyone and also i will not have true sexual intercourse with another only my beloved wife who refuses to do the things i have trained you for and it is past time for you to know the intimacy of love making rian would be gentle with you i wouldnt allow any other to have you
9054348 well rian does not want to be with me like like that
9054349 my dear your innocence still delights me of course rian would want you if he would take the time to realize it that is why i have come to a decision you will be in his quarters when he gets back from the fields and you will remain there until he does what i wish
9054350 you will spend every evening with him until he relents the first thing you must do for him is the thing i enjoy most he will not be receptive at first but it is something he needs to be humbled and give up control if only for a few moments do you understand
9054351 good my sweet angel i know you will succeed now finish with your tasks and go up to his room i will speak to him when he returns do not worry my sweet his anger will not be directed at you
9054352 dont fear me i dont intend to hurt you you can stay here in my room until my father gives up this ridiculous idea and you will be safe i will not do as he wishes
9054353 do you think it is wise to defy him i do not wish to incur his wrath anymore than you do i do not believe you will hurt me however i want you to do what he asks for both our sakes
9054354 father is right you are the most beautiful of all the women here i cannot deny that my body throbs with a desire a need i have rarely felt if you stand here before me much longer i will not be accountable for my actions if you do not intend to be taken this evening you need to redress and leave
9054355 i know how to give pleasure with my hands and my mouth but i have never been penetrated
9054356 your father has touched my breasts and my private areas and i found pleasure in that
9054357 you would know if you had it doesnt matter ill teach you
9054358 no rian look at me i need to see your eyes
9054359 do not do this thing to me i dont like it
9054360 rian relax how do you know you dont like it i know these are strange sensations for you but i promise youll enjoy it just lie back and take a deep breath let me do this for you bend your knees more let them fall open just relax rian try to take deep breaths and tell me if i hurt you
9054361 take a deep breath and hold it then push against my finger
9054362 relax rian breathe deeply let your body adjust to me
9054363 dont concentrate on what im doing just on what youre feeling dont fight it itll still happen even if you do fight and i can promise youll enjoy it more if you just let it happen

9054378 getting immediate reaction from such a large crowd is huge a lot of the people who come to the tour are obviously fans of the show they know these songs and theyre able to sing along its just a really celebratory vibe for all of us
9054379 i get nervous when i have to play in front of small crowds more than big crowds i think with less people you can feel the eyes burning a hole through you more
9054380 they sang all the songs back to me it was a really special vibe

9054399 blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the lord
9054400 do not be afraid zechariah for your prayer has been heard and your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you shall call his name john
9054401 truly i say to you among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than john the baptist yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
9054402 how shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife is advanced in years
9054403 i am gabriel i stand in the presence of god and i was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news 20 and behold you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place because you did not believe my words which will be fulfilled in their time
9054404 thus the lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me to take away my reproach among people
9054405 do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god 31 and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son and you shall call his name jesus 32 he will be great and will be called the son of the most high and the lord god will give to him the throne of his father david 33 and he will reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there will be no end
9054406 the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be called holy the son of god because of adam and eves fall all children are born with a sin nature romans tells us that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god but gabriel tells mary that the child will be born holy the son of god 36 and behold your relative elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren 37 for nothing will be impossible with god
9054407 behold i am the servant of the lord let it be to me according to your word
9054408 blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb 43 and why is this granted to me that the mother of my lord should come to me 44 for behold when the sound of your greeting came to my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy 45 and blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the lord
9054409 my soul magnifies the lord 47 and my spirit rejoices in god my savior 48 for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant for behold from now on all generations will call me blessed 49 for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name 50 and his mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation 51 he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts 52 he has brought down the mighty from their thrones and exalted those of humble estate 53 he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent away empty 54 he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy 55 as he spoke to our fathers to abraham and to his offspring forever
9054410 blessed be the lord god of israel for he has visited and redeemed his people 69 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david 70 as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old 71 that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us 72 to show the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant 73 the oath that he swore to our father abraham to grant us 74 that we being delivered from the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear 75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days 76 and you child will be called the prophet of the most high for you will go before the lord to prepare his ways 77 to give knowledge of salvation to his people in the forgiveness of their sins 78 because of the tender mercy of our god whereby the sunrise shall visit us from on high 79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace

9054430 whether its a workday a workout or a weekend theres a double wear formula that keeps up throughout your day smooth it on once and dont think twice about it
9054431 cvs is conducting a brief survey about prescription shopping and we are asking a small group of our advisor panel members to share their opinions with us by taking the online survey
9054432 whenever i put my name on the ballot i never in a million years thought id get to go
9054433 the state party actually contacted me and asked if i would be interested in being on the ballot since i was so young and involved and everything and i had told them i would be interested in being one for mccain
9054434 i just turned 19 so someone could be my age but no younger so probably so
9054435 when i was doing the report on him i realized i really liked him and he had really good credentials with his background as a senator
9054436 when they see there are younger people on both sides and not just one side it might give people more of an interest to get involved and see how it goes
9054437 i stood up to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good old boy network
9054438 he has come a long ways and that really jumped out this year at toronto in february
9054439 i took him to the grand prix and he shot master scores so that is the first place where he really showed he was starting to get it
9054440 they are kind of two different disciplines in shooting but the success in one definitely transfers over
9054441 he has a lot of natural desire for the sport but that doesnt take you very far you have to work hard and he has
9054442 i am sure its going to be a challenging and rewarding year like i say nich lives for it
9054443 he is a bit different that way where he really looks forward to all this work hes one person i dont have to keep going on about being on time and sticking with it he just naturally does it
9054444 there is a really nice relationship between the two cycling clubs they enjoy coming here and racing

9054460 in the roughly three years since she quit as the states chief regulator of the oil industry palin has crushed the republican hierarchy

9054463 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
9054464 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to support the iraqi people
9054465 the proof is always in the actions and not just in words
9054466 we have set a cultural programs for the mahdi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mahdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
9054467 right now nearly 4 000 centrifuges are operating at natanz
9054468 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourselves
9054469 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9054470 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9054471 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9054472 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9054473 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9054474 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9054475 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9054476 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl

9054479 in a loft that was a converted ice factory it had 40 foot ceilings it was gorgeous
9054480 everything that has ever portrayed our world has gotten it insultingly wrong
9054481 the portrayal of public defenders is as schlubby disillusioned generally incompetent people who cant get other jobs the reality is that my bronx office hired people from harvard and yale nobody believes it
9054482 the truth is i was between roles just being lazy and letting it grow out when i came onto this project both stephen and david wanted me to keep it long i think it really suits jerry david told me he really did go to trial with long hair so its not out of the realm of possibility
9054483 i dont want people to think the public defenders are the good guys and the das office are the bad guys
9054484 were going for the gray areas i hope people are entranced with what michelle does shes not someone you can root for all the time
9054485 a bold and historic move for the republican party that clearly targets women and conservative voters but does little to change the fact that mccains bush like policies would be disastrous for all americans especially women
9054486 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9054487 it is fitting that this trust has been given to me almost 88 years to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9054488 it turns out the women of america are not finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9054489 as the mother of one of those troops and as commander in chief of alaskas national guard
9054490 the kind of man i want as our commander in chief

9054492 how will she perform in the debate with sen biden on foreign policy he has a command of foreign policy details that few people in washington have she will have to cram like its her college finals
9054493 the person im about to introduce to you was a union member and is married to a union member and understands the problems the hopes and the values of working people knows what its like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries
9054494 shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing bureaucrats and anyone who puts their interests before the interests of the people she swore an oath to serve
9054495 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9054496 shes an nra national rifle association lifetime member shes a right to life feminist she has every credential as a conservative she is young shes exciting shes a mom with five kids

9054500 although i was hesitant last night about pursuing the first available transit of wasp 10b for capture due to the low preingress altitude of the host star
9054501 i decided to pursue the transit anyway so as get the experience and knowledge surrounding this relatively dim host star mag 12 70
9054502 and it is also interesting to note the prediction for egress does not agree with last nights result for it seems the total transit of 142 minutes should be greater
9054503 there is another opportunity to capture this transit at the end of the month and with the host star much higher in the sky it will be interesting to see how my result then will compare with last nights effort

9054509 personally my favorite teachers have been mr david norwood and mrs joy clift i greatly admire both of them because they brought me out of my comfort zone asa dancer and helped me to truly discover the beauty of dance without them iprobably would not have the same passion for dance that i possess today thank you so much to both of you i am so grateful for all that you have taught me in these years past i have always followed the classic oecarpe diem adage i will seek out any opportunity that comes my way dance has become such an integral part of my life that i hope to always be performing or teaching in some capacity in particular i personally hope to someday become an accomplished choreographer
9054510 things i learned from this video its hard to dance in the grass to turn and pivot and stuff but its easy to do in the grass 100 degree oklahoma weather is not fun to dance in i think my neighbors enjoy watching me that pot in the middle has a lot of worms and stuff in it i would know seeing as how i tried to move it but then discovered a plethora of insects
9054511 aw no favorites no can do but definately inspirers inspitations ect destini rogers oh my gosh this is so cliche but i seriously would not be the dancer that i am if it werent for her i always feel like she believes in me always has ever since she first became my instructor at 10 years old she grieves to be inspired and her teaching and just who she is pushes me to be the inspirer heres her shout out iloveyou
9054512 as a dancer my goals are definitely to go somewhere with my dancing which basically includes anything thats has to do with performing and i also would love to be on so you think you can dance some day and i think show you tube you can dance is kind of like the first step
9054513 change the way people look at dance but still stay true to myself
9054514 hi im arlin but you can call me arlie because most people would mistake arlin for arlene and i dont really like that it makes it sound even more filipino and i am but i like arlie better i love dancing and eating taco bell
9054515 my experience has been brilliant i love seeing different peoples styles and getting new ideas by watching their video responses that they post i think show you tube you can dance was a wonderful idea this has also been a wonderful opportunity to learn from different choreographers
9054516 for 9 years i received my dance training at centre stage school of dance i have now been attending the georgia ballet for 3 years going on 4 and i am also a member of the blessed trinity dance company and blessed trinity dance team one of my goals as a dancer is to broaden my creative perspectives i want to achieve this by continually learning from new choreographers and different styles of dance i never want to settle in my dancing rather i desire to expand outside of my comfort zone in my dancing dance is like a language to me and i would like to develop different approaches of expressing it this way i can grow in my own choreography as well another goal that i strive to reach through my dancing is to bring the joy and awareness of dance to others
9054517 well the studio i trained and grew up at was honolulu dance theatre in hawaii unfortunately they recently had to close so i am currently bouncing around a few different studios for a while i wasnt sure how i felt about dance and i thought i could do without it it didnt take me long to realize that i love dancing and that i really do need it in my life basically my goals are to just keep growing and learning as a dancer
9054518 i will do just what the song says to be brave and have intent im going to be excited about my future even though im leaving so much behind

9054536 this festival is important for the gta because it puts beer into a cultural and family context
9054537 you can bring the kids and have fun learning about beer not just the taste but the cultural and historical aspects as well the brews fest is a chance to discover beer as the noble beverage it is rather than the party drink you see in tv commercials

9054560 on the bright side im really familiar with both cars i dont foresee any issues going from one to the other
9054561 speed breaking points theyre similar and i know everyone im working with theyre both very competitive cars and hopefully ill be able to come away with two good results
9054562 weve accomplished a lot together but we feel like we can do even bigger things in the future
9054563 the team 7 eleven car has been a fixture at the top level of the indycar series since it debuted in 2003 and we expect to keep it there for a long time
9054564 its completely different from the setup of the car to the driving style its a finesse game
9054565 its unfortunate that you have to come with a car thats sort of in the ballpark youll see us making a lot of changes this weekend
9054566 its a short time to learn everything its a challenge
9054567 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9054568 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9054569 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9054570 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9054571 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9054572 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9054573 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9054574 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9054575 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9054576 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9054577 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9054578 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9054579 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9054580 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9054581 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9054582 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9054583 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9054584 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9054585 this seems to be the work of the gulf cartel
9054586 we will have to see where the heads turn up i am sure they will try something spectacular to shock society
9054587 even though they were shown to coexist systemic and airway inflammation appear to operate independently of one another
9054588 might explain the apparent need for increased inhaled anti inflammatory therapy in obese patients with asthma and the difficulties that are encountered in achieving good asthma control in such individuals
9054589 the association between obesity and asthma interactions between systemic and airway inflammation
9054590 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9054591 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9054592 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9054593 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9054594 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9054595 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9054596 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9054597 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

9054600 sarah palin is a pleasant surprise for those of us who had foxnews http elections
9054601 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9054602 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9054603 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9054604 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9054605 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9054606 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9054607 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9054608 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9054609 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9054610 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9054611 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9054612 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9054613 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9054614 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9054615 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9054616 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9054617 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9054618 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9054619 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9054620 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9054621 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9054622 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9054623 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9054624 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9054625 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9054626 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9054627 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9054628 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9054629 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9054630 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9054631 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9054632 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9054633 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9054634 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9054635 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9054636 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9054637 its so great to be here in san fran whoops i mean cape town
9054638 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9054639 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9054640 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9054641 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9054642 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9054643 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint

9054645 i feel like weve come a long ways since last year we were going for sixth in points two weeks ago and ended up 14th two weeks later its racing thats the way it goes i think that we have a good enough team that if we make the chase we can run in the top five of the points if we dont make the chase were going to run 13th in points its going to be disappointing when you have bad weekends or depend on what happens with these next two well just have to wait and see where we are at
9054646 as far as this weekend if they race well and we race well were not going to make the chase if they have some races where they are a little slower and were good then well probably make the chase its going to be interesting im up for it im excited for it well just see what happens i have no idea whats going to happen i think that we should have some really good cars i think well be really fast i look forward to that side of it
9054647 we had two bad weeks two weeks ago we were going for sixth in points and now we are 14th thats racing thats the way it goes i think that we are still a good enough team to be sixth or seventh in points if we get the right breaks well end up back in the chase

9054695 were disappointed we will be appealing on a myriad of issues and we are going to fight this all the way

9054697 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9054698 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9054699 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years
9054700 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9054701 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture
9054702 the president will thank his family his administration and most of all the friends supporters and volunteers in the convention hall who have supported him and the republican agenda for these past eight years
9054703 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9054704 were in high political season were not going to let it get to us were going to focus on the big picture
9054705 we have no intention of keeping our troops in security zones around south ossetia and abkhazia for the long term
9054706 we will also help south ossetia secure its own border
9054707 it is us who would have initiated this war which we did not do
9054708 we are concerned over the fate of syrian kurdish activist mashaal tammo whose disturbing arrest is the most recent of a string of detentions of civil society activists by the syrian government
9054709 we condemn the detention of tammo and other syrian prisoners of conscience and call for their immediate and unconditional release by the syrian government
9054710 we encourage the international community to join us in calling on the syrian government to stop its policy of arresting critics of the regime
9054711 i am deeply convinced that this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me

9054723 our students remarked to me that as we traveled down to the area by plane people were asking them where they were going and what they were going to be doing
9054724 when the students told them they were rebuilding homes destroyed by katrina people would say things like really the homes arent all rebuilt yet
9054725 many lower income families are still waiting to have their homes rebuilt
9054726 our students had a pretty good idea about what needed to be done as several of them have been here before one student has made his third trip
9054727 probably the biggest benefit was having different perspectives from students and adults
9054728 we intentionally divided them into different work groups in order to achieve new cooperation
9054729 they really enabled us to do a lot of stuff that we could not have done they really really came through
9054730 its a challenging thing to be away from home but if i didnt id feel like i was being disobedient
9054731 i enjoy what im doing and love seeing people work for the kingdom

9054916 all the time we are hungry and now we have no one
9054917 lovinsky used to help us all the time were hungry now we have no one
9054918 lovinsky was not a criminal we know when the wealthy are kidnapped the government does everything it can to recover the victim lovinsky is not a dog not an animal he deserves the same treatment as the wealthy people give us a report if hes dead give us the bones and well bury him
9054919 the victims are asking for the key give us the key so we can open the door of justice who are we asking for lovinsky
9054920 your government needs to launch an investigation but on lovinsky they dont want to do anything
9054921 the preval government continues the policies of the latortue coup government
9054922 on the social and economic plane we can work with him
9054923 they need to arrest people escaped from jail my life is in danger
9054924 i have too much work to do its hard to keep track
9054925 had contact with the lavalas movement thats why theyre in jail

9054935 write more and make more money from your writing develop a fast fun productive writing process
9054936 achievements are also an incentive for new players mostly because theyre not retroactive
9054937 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9054938 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs
9054939 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
9054940 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
9054941 the frequency of high grade storms class 3 to 5 hurricanes in the region has nearly doubled in recent years americas one and only source of production growth could be shut down again and the price impacts would be severe
9054942 i have a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of midnight sun that left my possession and each was unique
9054943 my first feeling was that there was no way to continue midnight sun
9054944 writing isnt like math in math two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like with writing the way you feel changes everything if i tried to write midnight sun now in my current frame of mind james would probably win and all the cullens would die which wouldnt dovetail too well with the original story in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
9054945 this way my readers dont have to feel they have to make a sacrifice to stay honest
9054946 i hope this fragment gives you further insight into edwards head and adds a new dimension to the twilight story thats what inspired me to write it in the first place
9054947 the writing is messy and flawed and full of mistakes
9054948 for all intents and purposes breaking dawn is the last book
9054949 it might easily happen that i quit here thered be a lot of good reasons for doing that so i dont know if we need to get into all the future possibilities and speculations cause ill just go crazy and im so close already

9054972 jurnalistul ro este unul dintre punctele de plecare ale unui nou tip de jurnalism
9054973 i like the new guys i think they bring a lot to the table
9054974 we have a lot of players who can create offensive opportunities on their own but we have a team that is based on a two touch system which makes it easier to move the ball around they can move the ball quicker instead of holding onto the ball and trying to create
9054975 i like the way we possessed the ball during a recent scrimmage the chemistry is a lot better weve just got to get the freshmen who are coming in involved a lot more i like the chemistry of the team and i like the potential we just have to work some things out defensively
9054976 were always looking to make a run at the championship i like what ive seen in practice and a scrimmage we should be in good shape to make another run
9054977 i think we have a great chance to be a really good football team this year
9054978 we lost a couple of close games that were very winnable last year were going to incorporate some new changes with some of the traditional style of play and i think we can be in contention every game this year
9054979 our primary goal for the year is to win a mac championship
9054980 that should always be the first goal here at lycoming
9054981 one of the biggest areas were going to tighten up on offense is our protection for the passer
9054982 we have two guys colin dwyer and tim hook that have both had a really good preseason
9054983 they will both play in the scrimmage and we will use those performances to help determine a starter
9054984 josh is one of the most talented kids on the field and mark and jim will provide a threat each time they touch the ball were really going to work on expanding the running game this year
9054985 they both gave us a great spring and have a chance to be very good players for us this year
9054986 we plan to keep the traditional approach of having a powerful defense in place
9054987 we gave up a lot of points as a result of field position last year but if you look at the numbers we posted excellent yards against figures
9054988 were going to work on getting more pressure on the opposing quarterbacks which should lead to more turnovers in our favor and were going to try to tighten up our red zone defense
9054989 we think we have six or seven really solid returning linebackers
9054990 were pretty excited about that group of athletes this year
9054991 we really struggled in all areas of special teams last year
9054992 we only attempted two field goals all year and we had a number of kicks and punts blocked throughout the year improving that coupled with shutting down the big returns is what were going to focus on

9054995 i just received a call that myself and five other people from this area from the mohawk valley are needed down in louisiana and well be going as soon as possible to help set up before the event
9054996 we want to make sure were doing what we can in the event that it happens but hindsight we dont want to look back and say that we incurred many costs that were unnecessary so were being conservative yet prepared and thats probably whats come across because of hurricane katrina

9055007 ucc music video contest for breaking up in the daylight was the one who produced the music video
9055008 on december 2007 we held a contest called the breaking up in daylight music video challenge where the winner got an award and was given the chance to produce an all expense paid music video for one of the artist signed under jype
9055009 the contestant who grabbed our attention was kim eui yun who eventually won the contest and was invited to produce the music video for this time which is thought of as wonder girls second title track after so hot
9055010 the music video is about the wonder girls members reading a book titled this time a complicated love story between a designer and a mannequin
9055011 this time is a bright ballad song so we decided to reflect the mood of the song by using only soft colors in the video
9055012 im still an amateur but i want to thank jype for giving me the chance to debut as a music video director and making my dreams come true

9055034 these are all baseless allegations im sure everything will be all right soon akhil is just like my son ive known him for 14 years now ive nurtured him this is nothing but petty politics some people are playing and they are using akhil as a pawn
9055035 its been proved you know this is what i mean when i say politics issues like this coming up now you can join the dots theyre all efforts to malign me
9055036 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second

9055038 as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual
9055039 this is a moment when principle and political independence matter a lot more than just
9055040 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9055041 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9055042 it is pretty audacious for the obama campaign to say that
9055043 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9055044 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9055045 no debe haber perpetuaci n del presidente el pa s debe tener nuevos l deres eso lo digo muy convencidamente

9055055 for those of you who dont know that songs called a wolf at the door
9055056 du bist echt ein netter kerl und ich habe dich wahnsinnig gern aber nur als freund
9055057 wenn er doch nur ein bisschen so w re wie du
9055058 du dein freund der sebastian ist der eigentlich noch solo
9055059 du bist mein bester kumpel und der einzige der mich wirklich versteht
9055060 du hast einen geilen arsch kommst du noch mit zu mir
9055061 es wird so ausgehn wie du es magst ich werde all das tun was du sagst ich werde da sein wenn du nach mir fragst
9055062 it looked as if there was a rock or something in the path that made the bicycle break in two
9055063 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington governor palin has challenged the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources
9055064 john mccain has just won the election with this pick
9055065 an exemplar of all that is good and true a major leader in the pro life movement
9055066 a republican star was born the triumph came in alaska where sarah palin a politician of eye popping integrity was elected governor she is now the most popular governor in america with an approval rating in the 90s and probably the most popular public official in any state her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
9055067 i am a conservative republican a firm believer in free market capitalism a free market system allows all parties to compete which ensures the best and most competitive project emerges and ensures a fair democratic process
9055068 some radical feminists will vote straight socialist regardless of circumstances i honestly believe for the first time that mccain and palin can now beat the socks off a democratic ticket which only has a discredited robin hood agenda
9055069 i almost fell over when i heard that mccain picked sarah palin she is great not afraid to take on some of our butthead republicans and call them on the rug for ethics violations like she did to sen stevens and rep don young of alaska who are both under indictment i saw a bumper sticker they have in alaska gov palin coldest state hottest governor ya gotta laugh

9055096 no allegations are made that these two isolated comments created a foreseeable risk of severe emotional distress that the distress from mariners comments was severe enough that ti might result in bodily harm or that any severe distress was related to these specific comments
9055097 therefore the committee felt because they were contentious and bringing division to the community they should be excluded from the discussion
9055098 you could not have glenrosa you could not have shannon lake or lakeview heights what im saying is that could also exclude gellatly or boucherie or green bay
9055099 it will create a different kind of division with people feeling disenfranchised especially after we have closed the process and submitted all of these names its going to create more concern in my opinion with people asking why the process was run this way to begin with

9055176 quieren vender agua dulce a chile en ning n momento han venido a hablar con el pueblo ni con la comunidad reci n ahora
9055177 el agua excedente que se encuentre ya pertenece a la empresa mines argentina

9055514 these cards have been immensely successful in generating tips and two cases have been solved bringing closure to the victims families and friends
9055515 the attorney generals office welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with our corrections and law enforcement partners particularly on such a creative and important initiative
9055516 people are often fearful of providing information on criminal activity especially in a prison environment
9055517 crime stoppers is privileged to use our existing anonymous call taking network in this valuable initiative our greatest hope is to continue to gather the missing information needed to bring closure to so many grieving families in florida
9055518 the issuing of the third edition of cold case playing cards is a testimony to the success of this program distributing these to the thousands of inmates within the jails and corrections facilities in our state exposes the cases to an audience of people most likely to have come in contact with these individuals
9055519 this will provide an excellent source of information to help law enforcement solve crimes the florida sheriffs association is proud to be a part of supporting this effort
9055520 the florida police chiefs association wholeheartedly supports this creative and innovative program that provides visual aids and factual information as a means to jog the memories of individuals that may have information vital to these cases
9055521 it is the hope of our members that this program coupled with state of the art technology that was not available at the time of many of these murders will lead to many more solved cases throughout florida
9055522 we usually dont have a choice on those matters we take them in whatever the doctors order we must prescribe
9055523 we consider electric vehicles as one of the candidates for sustainable mobility but for the time being the most realistic approach is to use the electric vehicle for short distance travel

9055527 john mccain heeft vandaag de voormalige burgemeester van een plaats met 9000 inwoners zonder enige ervaring met buitenlands beleid pal naast het presidentschap gezet
9055528 voortreffelijk persoon en een boeiende nieuwe stem in deze campagne
9055529 what could i have changed to make all this different
9055530 thanks so much for those kind words but i dont really feel very strong right now
9055531 in choosing alaska gov sarah palin to be his running mate he is not thinking outside the box as some have said
9055532 mccain voted 90 of the time with bush i dont know about you but i dont want to take a 10 chance on change
9055533 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but we are the one who will pay for his flip flops
9055534 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans
9055535 write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches

9055539 as long as what you do how you vote doesnt affect my way of life were cool
9055540 alaska needs to be self sufficient she says instead of relying heavily on federal dollars as the state does today
9055541 religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9055542 did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues
9055543 lo importante ahora es seguir adelante no quiero vivir siendo s lo un prisionero de guerra
9055544 two more years of an absentee do nothing governor while tim pawlenty curries favor with the privileged elite
9055545 mark was my partner my best friend my soulmate and brought great joy to all who knew him
9055546 thank you to everyone for your kind words i request that you let us grieve for him and please remember him with love
9055547 we are greatly strengthened and helped in this very difficult time by the expressions of sympathy and the kind comments about marks life and career
9055548 welcome to the tropics you only got the rain wait until you get the rain and the wind is two or three times as strong
9055549 we have had growth not insignificant growth in our national income household disposable income has continued to rise our employment numbers remain very high historically so people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
9055550 its a recession when your neighbour loses his job its a depression when you lose yours
9055551 to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers and the emergence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
9055552 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets
9055553 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
9055554 unfortunately many people feel the need to manually remove earwax called cerumen which serves an important protective function for the ear
9055555 cotton swabs and some other home remedies can push cerumen further into the canal potentially foiling the natural removal process and instead cause build up known as impaction
9055556 when cerumen builds to the point of causing symptoms such as pain ringing itching or hearing problems its a sign you should see a physician
9055557 the complications from cerumen impaction can be painful and include infections and hearing loss
9055558 it is hoped that these guidelines will give clinicians the tools they need to spot an issue early and avoid serious outcomes
9055559 do you have the duo core optimizer from that page installed
9055560 if you see something missing on the web you fill it that is part of the read write web
9055561 t kan me niet bommen wat ze denken fluistert ze in mijn oor net voor ze vol zwier en zwaai de deur uitgaat
9055562 i was attracted by the cr che and the gym but also the social aspect to it its really relaxed and if youre on your own you soon start chatting to people caitlin wanders around and i know i can relax because its completely safe
9055563 they felt life hadnt moved on since their mothers times before they became mums they had a lovely time with nice dinners and nights out and all of a sudden they were on a dirty church hall floor having antenatal classes they found it quite a shock
9055564 i was sick of going to soulless locations i wanted a place that my kids loved but also a place that i loved
9055565 im getting bored with the lindy scene so now im doing west coast swing
9055566 im getting bored with the lindy scene so now im doing west coast swing
9055567 i am very excited because its my first game and i get to throw out the first pitch
9055568 i love the cubs but i love the park more
9055569 ok maybe not right away i fought it a little but eventually gave in
9055570 its really really neat i think i am seeing a lot of cool stuff my dad said i can get all the junk food i want
9055571 ive been throwing the ball in my backyard and i can throw 80 feet
9055572 as governor she has fought for the people of her state and for a government that truly serves them in alaska she fought against cronyism and corruption and restored faith in what principled leadership can accomplish in battling wasteful and wreckless spending by congress governor palin called for a ban on earmarks even when they would benefit her state thats the kind of leadership america needs
9055573 the choice of joe biden to me is almost a confession by the obama campaign that this is a big problem because there really was no reason to pick joe biden except his foreign policy credentials so its saying look we know we need help on this its an affirmation by them in a way
9055574 if youre an independent and youre looking at this youre going ya thats a negative for senator obama and a positive for john mccain
9055575 youre going to hear republicans continuing to talk about it
9055576 i have walked the earth since the morning of time ive seen so many little men squandering little lives in petty power struggles that bring meaning to an otherwise futile momentary existences
9055577 if he promises me an end to boredom ill take it
9055578 sheesh none of these people are gonna hurt you theyre to busy with their own lives to bother anyway
9055579 let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who traveled the farthest a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours hillary rodham clinton
9055580 when i hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business i think about my grandmother who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman
9055581 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9055582 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9055583 im a doer and i only want the job if its going to involve doing
9055584 its good that the grand old party is putting their foot into the 21st century
9055585 obamas lack of readiness was the only way to win
9055586 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
9055587 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression
9055588 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9055589 i wont have religion as a litmus test or anybodys personal opinion on evolution or creationism
9055590 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction praise
9055591 like other have said the election could basically swing around this choice but obama cant really do anything about that
9055592 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
9055593 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
9055594 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
9055595 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
9055596 i believe it is the perfect format for horror it gives you that short sharp jolt that stands the hairs up on your arm and tickles at the back of your neck
9055597 usually i only get to see him and make fun of his hair once a week this way working together we can ridicule each other almost around the clock oh and i thought we needed a horror comic anthology that was not and ec tribute and dark delicacies is all drippy with class and shit
9055598 we plan on originals classics and tales from the collections well mix it up but for the kick off issues we wanted some of the big names and great stories to help us get this ship underway were not aiming for any particular theme for this comic series anymore than dark delicacies aims for one as a book in fact i think that the strength of the book is that not only is there something for everybody but its constantly surprising in its subject matter
9055599 then for our second issue we plan to switch gears and do an all clive barker issue with his now classic tale of zombie love beyond the grave entitled haeckels tale
9055600 we are constantly looking for artists and writers and tales that remain in your mind long after the comic has been closed there are still some stories and actual frames of the old ec comics that will never leave my head that i read years ago wed like to do that but in a new look and mold to move it forward for the 21st century
9055601 face various hairstyles or a ludicrously long list of beards
9055602 offhand i can assure everyone that before the year is over when our sidewalk upgrading program is done the entire stretch of sidewalks of edsa would be walkable and people would shun riding jeepneys and buses for short trips

9055606 topette dicese de camisa camiseta o similar que al ser usada por un ser humano se torna mucho mas grande q su humanidad
9055607 it was a total team effort and our scoring distribution was good our attack stats were even in both halves obviously with it being the first game there are some areas where we will continue to grow and develop we still have to get used to playing with each other
9055608 no game in the world is as tidy and dramatically neat as baseball with cause and effect crime and punishment motive and result so cleanly defined
9055609 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook
9055610 there were parts of his speech where i felt totally overwhelmed and felt that he was speaking those words directly to us
9055611 if there were any doubts that he could handle things as president in a crisis his speech tonight laid those concerns to rest
9055612 i think hes going to make a firm commitment to the native community
9055613 obviously i wish they would have mentioned natives it irritates me when so many are mentioned except us
9055614 i was hoping that he could have acknowledged us even just a brief mention
9055615 in a 40 minute speech theres just not enough time to address all the specifics that affect a particular community
9055616 i join the people of guam in mourning the loss of a son of guam petty officer anthony m
9055617 i commend our new attorney general and her staff for the courage fortitude and heart theyve shown in their recent efforts shutting down illegal gambling machines on guam
9055618 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
9055619 montreal international lgbt film festival image nation now 21 years strong is a unique cultural event that brings together outstanding local national and international films for both montreals gay and lesbian community and the citys avid film lovers hungry for innovative and groundbreaking cinema november 20 30 2008
9055620 this festival has been a part of the greater seattle queer community and beyond since 1996 and has become the largest festival of its kind in the pacific northwest the festival has garnered national recognition for showcasing extraordinary and award winning work including the northwest premiere of transamerica and the seattle premiere of shortbus the festival is also an important venue in the local seattle film scene and inspires members of our community to express their creativity through film and video
9055621 there is a long way to go to get up to that level in all honesty
9055622 this summer like last summer the jet stream has been a long way south much further south than we would normally expect it to be
9055623 it has been largely around the uk rather than between scotland and iceland where we would traditionally expect it to be
9055624 nous ne lavons jamais fait la construction du premier syst me de gazoducs a t lanc e pendant les ann es 1960 au plus fort de la guerre froide et la russie a respect ses obligations contractuelles jusqu ce jour ind pendamment de la conjoncture politique
9055625 nous sommes tonn s par la position de certains responsables de ladministration am ricaine qui se d placent en europe pour persuader les europ ens de ne pas acheter nos produits notamment notre gaz cest une politisation inou e du secteur conomique qui est tr s pr judiciable
9055626 we are still trying to determine how halasan managed to get out of jail and commit more crimes what we know is he is behind bars
9055627 this goes to show that after staging robberies in metro manila these robbers flee to the provinces to elude arrests
9055628 i believe our data demonstrates the impact of fetal programming and its potential impact on the beef industry
9055629 the conclusion drawn from the study based on the minimal impact on cow performance is very different than when you consider the impact on the unborn calf
9055630 all the time but i just think it goes with the territory
9055631 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim this is about you go out there and you fight
9055632 i think that what hillary clinton did was tremendous for the country she has kicked open many doors which now we have to bring many more women through millions more women through my being speaker of the house was breaking the marble ceiling in congress which is hard sen clinton had a bigger challenge to run for president of the united states what we have to do now is say we have to translate that not just for individuals but for all women
9055633 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9055634 dont bother trying to complain your only choice is to work twice as hard
9055635 look the best thing for your personal advancement is to suck it up no question but you have a responsibility to all the other women in your position too and if you say nothing then nothing ever changes and more people than just you will suffer from discrimination so you should consider doing the right thing and speaking out even though it poses a risk to you
9055636 everything i do carries political risk because nobody gets the scrutiny that i get
9055637 its not like i have any margin for error whatsoever i dont everybody else does and i dont and thats fine thats just who i am and thats what i live with
9055638 dont even know the woman dont even know what shes done why would he have picked someone that is that inexperienced
9055639 i will have to study who she is what shes about
9055640 weve built one of the newest and most exciting tools for our customers
9055641 this funding will give us the ability to expand and grow with the huge market out there
9055642 myedge is an annual product which gives individuals a personal pr service
9055643 after some states in that region experienced supply issues last year especially the dakotas we took a hard look at our operations to determine how we could help increase delivery efficiencies
9055644 and we decided to make the significant investment necessary to construct this new section of pipeline as it should help us significantly increase fuel supply in the region
9055645 a nice smile a look that is so inviting it gets my thoughts racing
9055646 when a girl is nice to me but rude to a waiter it shows selfishness
9055647 jakub stefano has nude videos on maleperfection net theres a preview on youtube
9055648 they look more like crack heads than republican terrorists these are the
9055649 ha ha ha i love the videos yeah the last scene was hot that was
9055650 man this is one hunk i have had so many hot dreams about what i would do and give to
9055651 this is a crying shame i thought that this country was clear of all the
9055652 afin de contrer les actes de sabotage et les attentats les forces de lordre de la r publiques et le minist re de la d fense sont en train de constituer des unit s et des brigades sp ciales
9055653 progress continues and we are now planning to submit the environmental impact assessment report and application once there is greater clarity on carbon dioxide regulations and we are able to better align our project with the timing of our potential customers
9055654 we will be reaching out to the provincial government and regulators to discuss some of our concerns
9055655 this just gives us more options just to figure out what is the best thing to meet our potential customers needs
9055656 i want to thank my management because without them we wouldnt be here
9055657 john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
9055658 for 25 years mccain has opposed a womans right to choose and we know that he will continue to push anti choice policies in the white house mccains pick of anti choice sarah palin is further evidence that his white house will be just another four years of bush style policies any remaining doubts about mccains extreme anti choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti choice records of sarah palin and john mccain
9055659 governors race top contenders meet one last time to debate
9055660 americans are tired of the kind of divisive anti choice policies that sen mccain and gov palin have pledged to continue to support the contrast between pro choice sen obama and anti choice sen mccain is clear voters are looking for a leader who respects womens freedom and privacy barack obama is that leader
9055661 is the galaxy one whole piece such that if i visit one planet in one game i can visit that same planet in my new game and of course can i blow them all up
9055662 the first game is going to show everybody what weve got so everybody knows what we have
9055663 we arent going to hide anything right now were just hiding it the first game youre going to see for yourself yall can judge us
9055664 youre going to have to develop two deep no question about this
9055665 a profound negative impact on the health and safety of american workers
9055666 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9055667 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9055668 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9055669 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9055670 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9055671 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9055672 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9055673 because it was not guilty across the board including four misdemeanors i think thats a very close to total vindication
9055674 we always get together with family functions and stuff and hes doing well much better
9055675 we have plenty of music left in the future as you know michael is recording the jackson brothers are recording
9055676 im told hes trying to do something spectacular and very important
9055677 fifty is just the beginning happy birthday youre going to enjoy it
9055678 i hope that this action will act as a wake up call
9055679 as i have said before it is not the intention of kuwait airways to take aggressive action for its own sake but in the absence of any meaningful dialogue and in the light of kuwait airways duty to protect public funds iraq airways and iraq can expect further similar action to be taken without further warning
9055680 what were trying to come up with is a small quantity for them to do trials with
9055681 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9055682 i would think the dnc and the superdelegates would have chosen the best qualified candidate as well
9055683 shes from a small town she went to what university mccain is old
9055684 she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and a campaigner she was just absolutely awful
9055685 i think it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9055686 were trying to cover our collective butts in case something happens
9055687 ie faction a attacks faction b and they fight for a while until faction c decides to come in and attack both of them
9055688 fresh water is a product whose relative economic value has risen substantially and will keep rising in the coming years
9055689 it has become a growing source of wealth and an increasingly worthwhile investment opportunity
9055690 markets for water and thus its export handled with transparency flexibility and solid regulation could improve substantially the way water is managed and used in quebec
9055691 this could create strong incentives for conserving water and would allow for the fair and efficient reallocation of available water to meet our needs
9055692 like many businesses across the country we continue to feel the economic challenges including consecutive newsprint increases over the past 13 months
9055693 continue to provide quality products and services for our audience which continues to grow in print and online
9055694 i think that you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers
9055695 the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9055696 i guess barry will have to go back to his greek temple and do some thinking
9055697 and for letting the living being released from its mothers body die unattended in what amounts to a trash can
9055698 a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb with or without artificial support
9055699 whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place
9055700 obamas decision to run for office was a personal choice not an executive decision
9055701 palin also was the commander in chief of the alaskan national guard and had to negotiate tough border skirmishes with our enemies the canadians
9055702 my campaign is not the campaign i thought i knew
9055703 theres a lot of thread here why has no one given us a concrete example of palin much touted executive prowess the only factual examples i see are from her opponents
9055704 he decided to invest a hundred million dollars in opening over 300 field offices and employing well over a thousand people over the course of this 18 month campaign
9055705 whoever told obama to come out and attack palins experience even before they congratulated her should be fired immediately
9055706 all the obama campaign has managed to do is showcase how even the bottom of the mccain palin ticket has more experience than the top of the obama biden ticket
9055707 i hate the word feminist because it sounds negative i mean i shouldnt be labled for wanting equal rights equal treatment
9055708 just answer the question name one executive decision that obama has made that has impacted thousands of lives
9055709 a s for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9055710 just answer the question name one executive decision that obama has made that has impacted thousands of lives
9055711 dems nominated a community organizer who voted present in state senate
9055712 spent 18 months out of his 24 months in senate campaigning rather than working
9055713 in the same way he and his spokes people attacked hillary
9055714 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all sarah palin speaking today in ohio
9055715 all the time we are hungry and now we have no one
9055716 lovinsky used to help us all the time were hungry now we have no one
9055717 lovinsky was not a criminal we know when the wealthy are kidnapped the government does everything it can to recover the victim lovinsky is not a dog not an animal he deserves the same treatment as the wealthy people give us a report if hes dead give us the bones and well bury him
9055718 the victims are asking for the key give us the key so we can open the door of justice who are we asking for lovinsky
9055719 your government needs to launch an investigation but on lovinsky they dont want to do anything
9055720 the preval government continues the policies of the latortue coup government
9055721 on the social and economic plane we can work with him
9055722 they need to arrest people escaped from jail my life is in danger
9055723 i have too much work to do its hard to keep track
9055724 had contact with the lavalas movement thats why theyre in jail
9055725 they accused kids of being gang members bandits and of association with malefactors the same techniques as under former dictator duvalier
9055726 in my experience nice arent really very nice at all
9055727 they should change their name to the clinical unit for not treating the sick
9055728 all i can do is be me whoever that is
9055729 obama was not appointed he most certainly was did you miss the entire train wreck
9055730 she was mayor for 8 years so yes she has 10 years executive experience
9055731 oh thats right a podunk little town that has less people then my high school did by your calculations any president of the student council is qualified to become president
9055732 he managed to win 30 primaries from voters equipped with
9055733 i have a feeling the republicans will make sure that all of the questions regarding palins positions on various issues will be answered during their convention personally i think it will be quite interesting learning more about her and maybe we should all hold back on the premature negative comments until we do find out more
9055734 hello can someone stop the spin and give me a comparison that makes sense here
9055735 not quite but thanks for really proving your intellectual dishonesty
9055736 please dems continue to find fault in firing a trooper who tazed an 11 year old girl and was caught drunk driving in his state vehicle
9055737 perhaps you could aim some of that frothy outrage at your own candidate for trying to use the doj against people that are running truthful ads about his relationship with william ayers
9055738 if its true that the trooper in question was abusing palins sister then youve got nothing
9055739 i have an electronic version of your book about yield spread premiums i read the book and the information was fantastic

9055743 we are negotiating with both and theyre going at the same speed
9055744 this is the natural reaction after the prices have run up for quite a while you tend to see a softness period coming in
9055745 the stronger for longer commodity cycle looks set to continue
9055746 but in the near term we believe there is a risk of further commodity price correction as global economic and demand growth continue to slow
9055747 of the base metals nickel is the one that is most likely to have formed a base i would not expect to see a lot of downside in nickel id be more cautious about copper in particular
9055748 everybody is sort of shying away from testing the waters on the metals side
9055749 their patronising approach lends them an eerie resemblance to the
9055750 this is all about short term control of the news cycle stepping on the obama speech this is a tactical choice not a strategic one this isnt answering the biden pick this is answering the positive press on yesterdays speech
9055751 this is actually a pretty good window into what a mccain presidency would be like short term fixes lurching from crisis to crisis totally misanalyzing problems and proposing bogus but flashy solutions that dont actually work
9055752 when you are investing actual money with actual capital that has actual limits
9055753 no single metric whether it be sharpe sortino whatever captures enough about any distribution of returns to be worth using in isolation
9055754 g overnment statistics in general and gdp statistics in particular are continuing their
9055755 but while gdp is not yet shrinking at least not according to the current data theres still a good chance in the future as
9055756 well thats ok at least theres jim who is frequently half naked and always muscled
9055757 well at least i still have bob sugar he may not be sexay like ol jimbo but i can still remember a time when i thought he was at least cute
9055758 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9055759 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure

9055782 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9055783 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9055784 we send our congratulations to gov sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president
9055785 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9055786 same goes for republicans screaming over and over that obama has no experience
9055787 suddenly the same republicans have no problem with a vp not even finishing their 2nd year of their 1st term in statewide office
9055788 no wonder the liberals are already on a smear roll guess what you can not have it both ways after saying for so long that experience didnt matter when it came to your presidential candidate who has none now suddenly it became important with the pick of the republican vp candidate i hope you keep up that argument because its the one you will not win
9055789 much like a garbage man calls himself a sanitation engineer
9055790 the governor is commander in chief of the armed forces of the state he may call out these forces to execute the laws suppress or prevent insurrection or lawless violence or repel invasion the governor as provided by law shall appoint all general and flag officers of the armed forces of the state subject to confirmation by a majority of the members of the legislature in joint session he shall appoint and commission all other officers
9055791 this is what obama always does let his people attack and then he would demounce to make him look nice he has done that many times to hillary during the democratic primary
9055792 what i dont understand is why nothing has been said about the
9055793 correction she is not from a small state but from a state with a small population like so many others on the electoral map small population states can produce great and powerful leaders ie clinton from arkansas gore from tennessee biden from delaware leahy from vermont etc etc i grew up in maine and we had a great senator named george mitchell
9055794 i feel bad for palins husband this guy actually figured out how to fish for a living and now he will have to move to dc
9055795 blip as governor of alaska she is the head of the alaska national guard so saying that she is the commander in chief of alaska is not padding her resume
9055796 any mother of five could probably do a better job of running the country than any of these guys really
9055797 the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise and fall as one nation read world the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9055798 why would mccain unveil his running mate during the labor day weekend news dump
9055799 former mayor of a town with less than 9000 people
9055800 put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9055801 obamas 143 days as a senator in washington is more experience than being the governor of the largest state in the nation for 2 years and a city mayor before that where is the rational and intelligent thinking of those critizing mccain palin ticket obamas resume is too thin for the presidential office also obama is a socialist not even moderate democrat
9055802 yeah our ticket sucks but not as bad as yours
9055803 well you think sarah palin sucks sure but not as bad as yooooooooooouuuu
9055804 the corporate goodies and mob contacts that came with the ayers family
9055805 let me hear the logic it is ok for 95 of the african american community to support obama but it is ridiculous and silly for women to support women hmmm
9055806 it appears to me that obama has a real problem with strong independent women
9055807 i found it curious that initial knee jerk reaction from the obama campaign was to demean and dismiss another woman
9055808 i found it curious that initial knee jerk reaction from the obama campaign was to demean and dismiss another woman arent they already experiencing sufficient difficulties with senator clintons supporters it appears to me that obama has a real problem with strong independent women
9055809 hiding his shady past and complete lack of voting history two bills authored by him in the senate one of which was to name a post office 29 votes of present in the illinois legislature during his six years there
9055810 the party that is supposed to be progressive ignores a woman and the opposition is the first one historically to pick a woman as vp
9055811 obama and mccain have been running for president as long as palin has been governor of alaska
9055812 palins actions speak louder than political words she has fought corruption in both parties in alaska
9055813 in fact obama and mccain have been running for in this election for almost as long as palin has been governor of alaska
9055814 they think just because she is a woman that they will flock to him
9055815 it was just yesterday that mccain ran a tv ad congratulating obama on his historic achievement
9055816 you saved me money time and much consternation for which i am truly grateful
9055817 as a friend of his grandfather for 65 years i find this very distressing his grandfather was one of the
9055818 i have a 13 5 million racketeering action filed against fairbanks sps that should indicate my
9055819 there is only one party responsible for the loss of the harper home the harpers it is not the
9055820 now if we find a contaminated bin under the terms of section 46 of the environmental protection act we serve a notice on every adult person in the household concerned this instructs them what they should put in their bins if we do bill them and they dont pay they will not be prosecuted under section 46 but can be prosecuted for non payment of a bill which is much easier to prove and will be easier to enforce in the courts
9055821 labours bin policies will harm the environment by causing a surge in fly tipping and fuelling public resentment at town hall bin bullies
9055822 budget gaps are starting to increase the viability of public private partnerships
9055823 people said hold it we dont want our infrastructure owned by foreigners
9055824 our concern is that some sources of financing see this as a quick opportunity to make money
9055825 theres a huge opportunity that the u s public sector is in danger of losing
9055826 it thinks there is a boatload of capital and when it is politically convenient it will be able to take advantage of it but the capital is going into infrastructure assets available today around the world and not waiting for projects the u s the public sector may sponsor in the future
9055827 look at the physical neglect crumbling bridges the issue of energy security environmental concerns
9055828 we are facing an infrastructure crisis in this country that threatens our status as an economic superpower and threatens the health and safety of the people we serve
9055829 our infrastructure is crumbling from bridges in minnesota to our airports and freeways
9055830 you can see and understand the businesses involved for example ships come into the port unload containers reload containers and leave
9055831 ten to 20 years from now infrastructure could be larger than real estate
9055832 the fact that the private sector raised 1 4 billion for the beltway project shows that even projects like hot lanes that are considered high risk can be developed and financed privately and that has huge implications for other large metro areas
9055833 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
9055834 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
9055835 since i have to chose between these two mccain or obama i will vote for obama
9055836 carter has done more for the poor and working people than mccain will ever do
9055837 what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9055838 measure investor confidence on a quantitative basis by analyzing the actual buying and selling patterns of institutional investors
9055839 i have a 5 yo great dane dexter generally in extraordinary health active playful a little smaller than akc spec at 109 lbs male neutered i believe his left upper canine has moved about a quarter inch out in the last two or three days there is no bleeding he doesnt act as though its tender inside the mouth on inside or outside of the tooth line or inside or outside surface of the lip the tooth is not loose to my senses his appetite and energy level seems even and hes no more clingy than normal there are no noticeable lumps or discoloration in his mouth what the heck is going on
9055840 on ne change pas une quipe qui gagne mais on la renforce
9055841 le grand petit monde de la rivi re des roches
9055842 daddy if you crash and go to jail i will go with you to jail so dont worry because i love you i can ride in the back of the police car because they have car seats in there now
9055843 while somewhere in this country people have been evacuated from their homes to avoid hurricane dems gather 84 000 people to celebrate and listen to obamas speech
9055844 i was dissapointed about obamas outright support for georgia against the russians in his speeach when it was georgia that was largely responsible
9055845 frankly when she is on stage with biden i know which one ill be watching with the sound turned down
9055846 if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education
9055847 if you have health care my plan will lower your premiums if you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of congress give themselves
9055848 and so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country
9055849 i dunno considering the alternative mcbush i still think obama is clearly the lesser of the two evils
9055850 the best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry
9055851 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9055852 but why some say the moon why choose this as our goal and they may well ask why climb the highest mountain why 35 years ago fly the atlantic why does rice play texas we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win and the others too
9055853 you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why sen obama didnt tap sen clinton as his running mate
9055854 as for that vp talk all the time i tell ya i still cant answer that question until until somebody answers for me what it is exactly that the vice president does every day
9055855 gov palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has a record of delivering on the change and reform that we need in washington gov palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9055856 any woman who has just given birth to a special needs baby would have put that babys interest above her own ambitions
9055857 maybe they hired the same team that is constantly scrubbing barry and tuccs websites
9055858 hey you pumas palin called hillary a whiner gee those republicans sure do love that word not only are we middle class whiners to them but now so is hillary
9055859 looks like the mccain campaign has scrubbed palins wikipedia article to remove references to her current ethics investigation as well as as state dairy farm that she was involved in
9055860 i might not like hillary that much as a person but she can get the job done
9055861 check out the investigation sounds like the cop deserved to be canned
9055862 the republican party cares more about the fetus actually the political wedge it provides more than the actual fetus than born children
9055863 do you remember the debate between cheney and edwards me neither
9055864 i know this is pandering for the womens vote but women voted for hillary because she was the first women with credibility to run for office
9055865 dont worry youll have president mccain to take care of you and your baby
9055866 can you imagine palin in a debate with biden talking about foreign policy
9055867 she does herself a disservice to even mention it really youve got to plow through that youve got to know what youre getting into
9055868 hee hee hee hillarys true supporters are for hillary because of her experience her believes and they respect her as a person dearly
9055869 can you imagine palin in a debate with biden talking about foreign policy
9055870 hey curious if there are any non white folks who are mccain supporters
9055871 you are going to have a lot of women voters wondering why senator obama didnt tap senator clinton as his running mate
9055872 im sorry but palin is tight with ted stevens if stevens is convicted any time soon i dons see how this will help mccain
9055873 you cant say anything negative about palin without hurting the man at the top of your ticket
9055874 the fact is she has only 2 years of experience as governor which may not in and of itself mean anything but it does mean that mccain can not seriously question barack obamas experience any longer
9055875 should something happen to john mccain i can guarrentee palin will have the best advisors around her
9055876 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9055877 they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
9055878 because she is a trojan horse dressed in armani and shania twains hairstyle
9055879 for a decade she was mayor of wasilla alaska which has a population of approximately 8 471 which the obama camaign says is less than 1 20th the size of his former state senate district
9055880 odd how you are stretching so hard to smear senator obama rather than to build up governor palin a governor for less than 2 years of a state with a population less than south dakota and a mayor of a town of almost 8000 before that
9055881 undecided women are suddenly flocking to mccain because he has chosen palin for vp just because she is female i certainly hope not
9055882 mack you ever realize the architecture of washington dc including the white house and capitol include many columns you gonna bash the architecture in dc now
9055883 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9055884 they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
9055885 kim there is a big difference in being the governor of a state that has a small population with a reletvively small budget and the national economics that we see lying in front of us now
9055886 if all he care sbout is the women who voted for hilly guess what that says about how he cares for this nation
9055887 i think that most women can recognize that palin doesnt come anywhere near hillary in ability intelligence and gravitas
9055888 the thing that people are forgetting the democrats 18 million of them voted for hillary it is a bit off the mark to call the democrats an anti woman party
9055889 if you compare hillary to palin there is a big difference and i think that most women can recognize that palin doesnt come anywhere near hillary in ability intelligence and gravitas
9055890 if the media cnn msnbc attacks palin there will a huge backlash
9055891 mccain was better off letting the election be a referendum on obama and his
9055892 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9055893 it doesnt really matter that hillary was smart or knowledgable women just like her cause shes a woman they dont care about knowledge or politics so ill throw them a bone and this one looks like well you all know what i think she looks like a lot more attractive than that kay bailey hutchinson was
9055894 if something were to happend to him would the vp be ready
9055895 but dont say he isnt qualified or experienced because you know deep down that he is and your reasons for hating him have nothing to do with his qualifications at all
9055896 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9055897 i believe that people will look back and assess how hillary was treated by the media during the campaign primaries and it remains to be seen whether or not the ugly head of sexism in the media will raise its head again
9055898 any woman who votes for mccain palin simply because she is a woman is an idiot
9055899 mccains pick should sway the hillary voters i see it as more of a slap in the face
9055900 the choice of the person who would be a heartbeat away is especially important
9055901 and you want to compare this to obamas experience from illinois a state with 13 million people
9055902 younger woman for john mccain to have an affair with
9055903 i am a male hillary supporter who wanted a woman for a change
9055904 becasue the entire repub party and half of the dems hate her
9055905 for your information obama was a community organizer not high office experience before he became senator in 2004
9055906 after months of ignoring obamas 8 years as an il legilsator in addition to his 3 1 2 years as a senator in order to call obama inexperienced right wingers now hold somneones being mayor of a town of 5000 people as the right experience to be president
9055907 which the obama campaign says is less than 1 20th the size of his former state senate district
9055908 wha bhos experience in state legislature is voting present against palins ten year executive experience as mayor
9055909 bhos less than two years in senate out of which almost 1 5 years in campaigning against two years of palin as governer no comparison
9055910 true but consider that obama has spent 50 of his time in senate campaigning for president
9055911 to determine if palin dismissed alaskas public safety commissioner because he would not fire a state trooper mike wooten
9055912 politically he has chosen to turn the race into an ideological campaign
9055913 governor for two years vs senator for less than two years hmmmmmm really do you really want to talk about experience
9055914 the quote was taken out of context she was saying what her daily job would be on the mccain presidency as vp adn that she needs it to be real and productive
9055915 what history is that mack go back to school adults talking here
9055916 so apparently its okay a black guy with zero experience can be the 1 pick on the dems ticket
9055917 but a woman with zero experience cant be the 2 pick on the republican ticket
9055918 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9055919 yesterday the democrats selected not elected a former community organizer with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9055920 as for that vp talk all the time i tell ya i still cant answer that question until until somebody answers for me what it is exactly that the vice president does everyday
9055921 if its okay for a senator with no experience to be the democratic presidential nominee then surely its okay for the governor with no experience to be the number 2 person on the republican ticket
9055922 the best defense against usurpatory government is an assertive citizenry
9055923 obama has no experience and judgement to lead this country
9055924 and i dont think she wanted to be vp she wants to be president maybe after obama
9055925 palin has been governor for two years some might argue that in terms of experience she makes obama look like robert byrd
9055926 i am sure the mccain campaign would love for obamas campaign to keep reminding us of the experience issue hopefully on a daily basis
9055927 i hope that this action will act as a wake up call
9055928 while yes it says things were worse than we actually thought then it doesnt necessarily tell us a lot about what happens next
9055929 the things that are interesting is that while growth has been slower than expected the things that are underlying it show a slowdown in consumer spending which is no surprise

9056143 a few years ago it was all about climate change now energy security has come up too the problems arise when the two come into conflict
9056144 the key issues are now defined by what are coherent responses to these twin concerns
9056145 where there are conflicts it would be dumb to do something which is entirely one at the expense of the other but there are signs of a drift in that direction
9056146 there is clear evidence of backsliding it is our job to make sure they dont this is no time for short term expediency
9056147 until very recently climate change has been top of the agenda but with issues in georgia and increasing energy prices due to increased global demand security of supply will come more to the forefront
9056148 we cannot afford to say no to new coal new gas or new nuclear

9056151 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9056152 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9056153 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9056154 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of senator obama
9056155 the fact remains obama is still not ready to be president
9056156 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9056157 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9056158 deputy john palmer expressed his frustration with the fact that this incident was being investigated now
9056159 he stated that he is upset that the past administrative lieutenant and the then county administrator bill post both had knowledge of the incident and did nothing about it then but as soon as villagesoup did an article about it it immediately became a big deal
9056160 i absolutely didnt know about that video until i saw it on villagesoup if i had seen that video before there would have been discipline
9056161 palmer believes that if discipline was to be administered it should have been done then
9056162 another concern was how any permanent discipline can hamper careers concerning promotions assignments etc
9056163 during this incident a sergeant with many years of experience had directed palmer to pick up the taser from lincoln county and to deliver it to the social function
9056164 this sergeant was present during the entire incident along with many more experienced officers a new officer may have had partial belief that it was not a problem
9056165 the administration knew about this incident long before the media blew it out of proportion and that it should have been handled then
9056166 twitchell stated that the comment in the media quoting the sheriff saying i am ashamed about the incident shows that she had a predisposition about the guilt of anyone involved long before the facts had been made known
9056167 he believes that the penalty decision had been made long ago and that the predetermination hearing was a smoke screen for the administration to do whatever they want to save face including hanging them out to dry
9056168 came into the planning of the event late but that it doesnt excuse what occurred
9056169 he believes that the video recordings were taken off duty and were for private use they were never intended to be used for sale
9056170 he states that lt burgess gave everyone permission to use the departmental cameras for private use and that lt burgess watched the videos several times in the office for 2 5 minutes at a time and he just laughed
9056171 he said that the lieutenant never did anything about it nor did acting sergeant walker or chief deputy mcintosh so sprague believed that it was not a problem
9056172 he feels that they should not be the only ones held accountable when supervisors did nothing or even said anything to them that it was a violation sprague also said that the agencys past administration never held policy training
9056173 sprague stated that he was also concerned that sheriff dennison once stated to him that the firing of the taser was still a crime even though no charges were filed
9056174 he was also concerned that the chief deputy was always making comments like its gonna get worse and was always talking about the case even at the firing range
9056175 if its not an excuse for us then why is it an excuse for them
9056176 briefly related that he was sorry for what this incident has grown into and that he had learned a valuable lesson about his conduct
9056177 walker was very sincere in saying that he was sorry that this incident occurred and of the resulting embarrassment to the department
9056178 his participation was never intended to cause the sheriffs office any problems

9056401 ho scritto kings mentre stavo lavorando su heroes e sono stato assolutamente ispirato da ci che stavamo raccontando una storia pi grande della vita stessa ho tratto molte idee dagli altri autori dello staff e ho chiesto spesso il loro aiuto e consiglio loro sono stati molto generosi e senza i loro suggerimenti e incoraggiamenti non sarei riuscito a portare a termine questo nuovo progetto
9056402 ci sono molte somiglianze tra kings e heroes e il racconto di una famiglia che nel caso una famiglia reale la storyline si dipana puntata dopo puntata anche se ogni singolo episodio sar leggermente pi stand alone come ad esempio in pertanto non ci saranno difficolt per gli spettatori ad entrare anche a serie iniziata
9056403 mi sono chiesto chi pu essere golia in questo mondo
9056404 si trattava di prendere gli elementi fondamentali della storia raccontata nella bibbia e che tutti conoscono e riproporli in chiave moderna alla fine abbiamo raccontato la storia della caduta di un re e della nascita di un altro re qualcosa di simile alla saga di il padrino
9056405 la fantascienza non mi spaventa tuttaltro per non abbiamo voluto fare una space opera bens calare la vicenda in un mondo familiare allo spettatore ma al tempo stesso completamente reinventato e stato divertente immaginare questo nuovo mondo a cosa poteva somigliare abbiamo ripreso lestetica di new york ma facendola sembrare una citt diversa ricordo che una volta battlestar galactica che la domanda che si facevano spesso lui e il suo team era come saranno i pomelli delle porte in un altro mondo ecco abbiamo voluto costruire un mondo in cui le cose somigliano un po a quelle della nostra realt ma lasciando sempre un margine di incertezza
9056406 mi piace pensare che la mano della fede guidi gli eroi e sono curioso di vedere come la gente percepir le situazioni che si presenteranno nel serial sono sempre le solite discussioni che si aprono quando succede qualcosa di speciale e ci si chiede magia e qualcosa che va oltre la fisica e una coincidenza o solo fortuna nello show ho deciso di non dare spiegazioni ma lasciare che ciascuno interpreti come vuole

9056447 the imagery and the message behind obamas speech was more powerful than any that i have ever seen in my lifetime
9056448 its really refreshing to actually be able to witness history unfolding like this
9056449 it was a complete inspiration i have high hopes for our next president
9056450 i cried my eyelashes off i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9056451 hes not an african american candidate hes a candidate for americans
9056452 its strange to get the feeling that you will remember the exact moment and place you were sitting when someone gives a speech
9056453 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
9056454 theres the chills you get from hearing an incredible melody in a song from seeing the best movie youve ever seen in your life but this was something different i dont want to this to sound like a joke but obama has coin face his face will look amazing on a silver dollar and i want to be spending that silver dollar
9056455 he talks about hope but he actually delivers he has supports facts figures and the ba s to say it all at the risk of his political standing
9056456 his speeches convince me that he is an honest politician possibly the first in a desperately long time
9056457 there is going to be a paradigm shift in the world as we know it he just won

9056481 the walls that king and obama are trying to tear down are much different
9056482 king was trying to tear down the walls of injustice obama is trying to build walls of opportunity
9056483 he couldnt mention martin he couldnt mention the civil rights movement he couldnt mention those who sacrificed and gave so much its very very difficult to actually create a new world if you dont acknowledge the world from which you are emerging

9056509 the problem has been resolved and its been operating consistently for the past two weeks
9056510 it is emphasized government agencies and their employees cannot destroy records at will
9056511 with respect to the retention and disposal of records section 57 25 of the arts and cultural affairs law states in relevant part that
9056512 2 no local officer shall destroy sell or otherwise dispose of any public record without the consent of the commissioner of education the commissioner of education shall after consultation with other state agencies and with local government officers determine the minimum length of time that records need to be retained such commissioner is authorized to develop adopt by regulation issue and distribute to local governments retention and disposal schedules establishing minimum retention periods
9056513 further when an agency indicates that it does not maintain or cannot locate a record an applicant for the record may seek a certification to that effect
9056514 shall certify that it does not have possession of such record or that such record cannot be found after diligent search
9056515 that city of north tonawanda police department does not have possession of records photographs or that such record photographs cannot be found after diligent search
9056516 that a failure to determine an appeal within ten business days of the receipt of an appeal constitutes a denial of the appeal

9056518 well negotiate the best way to incorporate the employees to sidors payroll
9056519 both pri and pan will realize there is nothing they can do to prevent former presidential candidate leftist prd party andr s manuel l pez obrador from going onto the streets so they may as well get a better reform theres no reason to give something up to him if its not going to appease him
9056520 i think no matter what happens l pez obrador is going to call it privatization and hes going to take it to the street because his objective is more than simply to have a good reform for state oil company pemex its to use this as a way to weaken the current administration
9056521 we think the core of the reform is the law to include these incentivized contracts and flexibility for pemex to contract that is something key that should be included in the reform without that it will be nothing more than administrative changes
9056522 there might be a couple of loopholes in the law but really i dont see anything there rather i think the emphasis of the reform will be on administrative reforms of the firm

9056570 the prefab options are much better than they were four yeas ago the lv house michelle kaufmans designs the blue dot flat pack the weehouse these havent come and gone theyve come and stayed but it will take 10 years for them to really become established
9056571 scott likes to be cutting edge be in on the next big trends for building and business
9056572 now that the house is done he gets a lot of cache from his friends for living in a prefab house
9056573 it couldnt be so precious or so expensive that muddy paws couldnt run through it without making me panic
9056574 the nice setback on the house leaves a tremendous space for gardening planting tomatoes basil and garlic
9056575 the windows the roofing the framing the plumbing the electrical every single area went over budget
9056576 we thought all in the cost would be around 250 per square foot its probably now closer to 350 per square foot it may be even be as high as 400 per square foot
9056577 its 10 acres surrounded by a 200 acre property you really feel like youre alone in the woods its such a great feeling to be totally connected i can sit there with my cell phone and wireless internet and have a video conference call with china on my deck using skype that was the idea to remain connected work remotely and get away from the cities
9056578 the big thing we were looking for was that modern look
9056579 thats what i think separates these new prefab homes from older iterations
9056580 ultimately people dont sense that its prefab except that it is a very simple space
9056581 ive observed stick built houses in our neighborhood that started sooner than ours and theyre still under construction
9056582 but in the end i dont know id have to do it all over again to really know if prefab is anything unique
9056583 what we werent prepared for was the quality of the house i have built several houses and this is by far the best quality home ive ever lived in its fabulous when you build on site theres little quality control the individual contractors are all supposed to do their jobs but the overall aesthetic is almost left to chance in a factory you have quality control at every step
9056584 we didnt compromise on any beauty or aesthetic at all to go with a green home
9056585 we havent gone green and said oh its different because its green going green has turned out to be aesthetically pleasing
9056586 focus on just the exterior not the interior life of a home
9056587 weve gotten to a place where we dont think of ourselves as dwelling in nature we need to blur the boundaries between indoors and out and realize were part of rather than separated from the larger environment beyond our own four walls
9056588 the whole concept of organizing purging what you dont need being spatially aware in your personal environment is fundamentally eco friendly it encourages efficiency conservation and simplicity
9056589 but for softening or dyeing toxins might be used so definitely ask questions
9056590 draws every last drop from natural light to increase energy efficiency if you cant renovate because you rent or if you live in an older not so green home you should still work with existing light watch where the sun falls and use it to illuminate your indoor work whenever you can

9056664 the issue is nothing more than a game plan of the congress to gain political mileage its not about controlling the gurdwaras in haryana its an emotional issue the sgpc denotes sikh power and pride across the world and any attempt to dilute it would hurt sikh sentiments
9056665 since the pm has intervened and given an assurance as reported in the media sad sgpc should wait for a response

9056683 under the white v davis case the california supreme court determined in 2003 that in the absence of an active state budget the state has no authority to pay state workers anything
9056684 but federal law says they must be paid minimum wage
9056685 local cities are bound by law to have their budgets approved by june 30 but the state can be late and take money away from us at their discretion
9056686 i think local government is tired of being the whipping child for the states irresponsibility in getting a budget passed
9056687 right now were continually having to tighten our belts because of the states inability to reach a budget compromise
9056688 most of the school districts in calaveras county have already done layoff notices or not replaced retiring teachers and now the state wants to delay the payments they owe us until later in the year to solve their cash flow problem because of their unwillingness to compromise our students are paying the price
9056689 there has to be some kind of penalty to get them together
9056690 all they need to do is see how much money they have and budget it every household has to work within its means and so should our elected officials
9056691 i really hope our legislators come together and reach a compromise as soon as possible
9056692 we know more cuts will be coming our way we need to know what they are as soon as possible so we can act quickly
9056693 but as long as theres no budget the controller has no legal authority to issue checks to those medi cal providers its a clear example of one of the costs of the legislatures failure to enact a budget in a form the governor can sign
9056694 we can only make emergency purchases and provide basic services
9056695 so far we havent had any layoffs and thats good
9056696 thats how we are spending millions on the angels camp bypass right now while the state is going broke
9056697 the legislature has to stop dealing with budgets on a year to year basis and get a long term plan in place like schools local governments and individuals are forced to do
9056698 you can put any numbers here right now its a leap of faith
9056699 it could prevent not only happy slapping but videos of police brutality

9056757 ive kept out of doing this kind of interview you have to be quite careful unless youre one of those people whos happy to give everything of themselves and i for one am not
9056758 well thank god i didnt have to go there on millennium night
9056759 oh no you didnt have your collar all scruffed up like that for the pictures did you
9056760 becoming chancellor is completely different from any other appointment completely different even when times are easy its important because youre dealing with money and money affects how everything works when times are far from easy its even more difficult and we knew the economy was going to slow down
9056761 i remember i picked up the ft in the supermarket as you do and it had the european central bank starting to put money into the economy i phoned the office to ask why they were doing quite so much it didnt surprise me that money was going in there was concern going around but it was the sheer scale of it i said what about our institutions this was when northern rock started to figure
9056762 i received a phone call and went straight down to london from where i never returned that was the last time i saw edinburgh
9056763 this is a disaster this is terrible i said we have to search the place from top to bottom one of them said well start monday i said no we start today i phoned gordon up i said we appear to have lost two disks containing the personal details of just about every family in the country we knew it was bad
9056764 and i think its going to be more profound and long lasting than people thought
9056765 theres got to be a life outside politics it was nice to go to the pictures and go for a nice meal afterwards one of the great pleasures was getting to edinburgh and going out for a meal with friends who dont do politics
9056766 the waiter came over and said too much wine in a loud voice so we stuck to the one bottle for the entire meal
9056767 well i think most people understand perfectly well that most of the problems they face are international however that doesnt help sell their house i was at a filling station recently and a chap said i know its to do with oil prices but what are you going to do about it people think well surely you can do something you are responsible so of course it reflects on me
9056768 no theres nothing more pathetic than people feeling sorry for themselves so you get on with it you just have to deal with it theres lots of people whod like to do my job and no doubt
9056769 frankly if you had a reshuffle just now i think the public would say who are they anyway you name me a reshuffle that ever made a difference to a government actually
9056770 and you cant be chopping and changing people that often i mean undoubtedly at some stage before the end of the parliament he will want to do a reshuffle but im not expecting one imminently i do not think there will be a reshuffle
9056771 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for but weve got a hell of a lot to do we patently have not been able to get across what we are for and what we are about
9056772 yes i do think he can i do think he will
9056773 well its always difficult you know you can always say what could you have done better and all the rest of it but gordon in september up to party conference has got the opportunity to do that and he will do that its absolutely imperative
9056774 were grown ups but no one likes to read nasty things about their friends
9056775 we were an ordinary family we talked about events but we didnt sit around the table having intense discussions about what marx thought
9056776 very different people but we had a very clear sense of what was right and what was wrong my father always thought conservatism was about helping people less fortunate than you my mother was very clear about what you did and didnt do she was very clear about saying thank you and being courteous
9056777 strictly bread and butter issues things like food prices in the student refectory
9056778 if you want to make any changes theres only one way you can do it and thats by getting into a position where you can influence things and the obvious thing to do seemed to be to join a party
9056779 just i suppose overall i thought the tories were unfair they were only for one side and not for everyone the labour party just seemed to reflect my outlook on life you know that we were better working together fairness helping everyone to get on rather than just a few the labour government in 1977 was in a terrible mess and i was getting fed up looking at all these things on the television and thinking god surely we can do better than that i wanted to do things but i was never really interested in the theory of achieving things just the practicality of doing things
9056780 we werent the ones who leaked it it had already appeared in other newspapers before and at any other time i would just have ignored it but understandably i was asked about it
9056781 then i need to deal with a whole range of things
9056782 yes all right but if youre going to announce anything in the housing market you dont do it in the middle of august its just a silly time to do it
9056783 i get very exasperated when people say we need to show people we are concerned its just the wrong approach i think theres not a man woman or child in this country who doesnt understand the problems people are facing people are not particularly interested in public demonstrations of your understanding you just need to get on with it
9056784 i wouldnt personalise it my criticism is not of him as an individual
9056785 why i think the tories are bad is different from why i think osborne would be a bad chancellor
9056786 i think my criticisms are of the tory party rather than him
9056787 the tories havent really changed they may have packaged things differently but fundamentally i think they are still very much focused on helping a few people and not very bothered about most people
9056788 there are times when i listen to cameron and im not sure what he does believe in i dont say that in any nasty sense i just dont have any sense of what if he was prime minister he would want to do
9056789 i think youre right george osborne is a politician and hes made an enormous amount of promises but its not clear how he would pay for them osborne knows what hes doing in terms of playing the political field thats why i say hes a very good politician because he takes his moment but whats his long term view of where the country needs to go what is his vision for the future what sort of country does he see britain becoming in the next 20 to 30 years i just dont know
9056790 half a dozen eggs that would be 1 20 i know they have cheaper ones i saw them but the ones my wife specifically wanted were 1 20
9056791 i much prefer to be doing things than shouting about them
9056792 part of politics is you do need to shout politics is the art of communication if you cant communicate then it doesnt matter if youre truly brilliant as a technocrat there are lots of people who are very good but they just cant communicate it
9056793 well it was the same reaction i used to have with the blairs thank god i dont have to do that
9056794 i mean it was probably an accurate representation of both of them i didnt honestly i just couldnt get excited about those pictures one way or the other i mean of course theyre both posed cameron was as posed as they come
9056795 but im not going to be hypocritical about it when ive spent 15 minutes on a beach being photographed in a very unnatural posture
9056796 thats why im not a great politician you know im not very good at looking at pictures and subjecting them to the equivalent of textual analysis
9056797 theres nothing wrong with the term its just not one i use
9056798 im not offended if someone earns large sums of money is it fair or not its just a fact of life
9056799 pragmatic i passionately believe in living in a fair country and treating people properly with proper respect and fairness
9056800 as a minister by and large i had a charmed life i was sorting out problems rather than being landed with them
9056801 it is true that bell labs research has gotten out of material science research and device physics research because we are no longer in the semiconductor business but fundamental research is still alive and well and going on throughout bell labs
9056802 we also closed our cmos fab at murray hill keeping only the very high performance fabrication equipment that we now use for gallium arsenide custom and optical components
9056803 if you look at bell labs historically going back to the late 1940s when semiconductor research got its start a lot of that research was driven by bell labs
9056804 but today semiconductor research is spread out across the world in both the university landscape and in corporate research so its much more diffuse and diversified today nobody has a corner on semiconductor research anymore there is no single entity that if it went out of existence today which would impact semiconductor research one iota
9056805 fundamental research in wireless networking optics computer science and still even in physics but there we are focusing on quantum computation high speed electronics and nanotechnology with a group that is larger than the four ive seen reported in the media
9056806 admittedly it is a much smaller group than before when we were doing silicon device research
9056807 we continue to have physical technologies research group and a physical sciences research group in the past they were divided into fundamental materials science and device physics but now they are focused on quantum computation high speed electronics and nanotechnology
9056808 we still sponsor undirected research but not as much as before for instance we dont do the astronomy work that we used to do but now we focus our researchers in areas where we know they can be successful
9056809 from our point of view that was really always the case we didnt study cosmic background radiation because we thought is was interesting physics we studied it to improve satellite communications it turned out we also solved an interesting physics problem but that was not our intent
9056810 today our mission is not that different from what is was before we have always done and still do research that is scientifically important but which is also relevant to the area of computation and communications
9056811 even for transistors we didnt study them out of curiosity we studied them because you cant make good telecom switches out of vaccum tubes
9056812 when lucent had a semiconductor business that was coupled into selling communications chips it was perfectly reasonable to have a semiconductor research group that focused on materials and devices
9056813 even after the spinoff to agere systems inc which merged with lsi corp last year we kept the group going for six years just because it was doing very good physics and gave us another way of looking at communications problems but now we have decided to move on close that facility and focus instead on fundamental work in networking wireless and optics

9056824 ik vind het verbazingwekkend dat een gemeenteraad zegt we stoppen vijftig miljoen in een stadion en als het mis is hebben we niet de guts om er extra geld in te stoppen
9056825 dat is een misverstand de investering is juist wel de afgelopen maanden in ado gestopt onder andere het crediteurenakkoord en de afwikkeling met hebema zijn gebeurd alleen de lening van de gemeente aan sso is nog niet aangepast maar daar heeft ado geen last van
9056826 nee hoor mijn zomervakantie was wel een stukje drukker dan vorig jaar omdat er nog zoveel geregeld moest worden en n g eigenlijk maar als je ziet waar we vandaan komen is het w l leuk de hele reddingsoperatie was in eerste instantie gericht op de eerste divisie toen ado den haag plotseling promoveerde moesten we snel handelen je kunt niet de illusie hebben dat je met de ploeg die vorig jaar in de eerste divisie met de kerst zeventiende stond nu de eredivisie in kunt dus heb ik tegen andr wetzel gezegd we gaan meer geld uitgeven
9056827 achteraf was het wel een tegenvaller dat de verkoop niet doorging swansea wilde ado betrekken in de deal er kwamen berichten dat hij twee miljoen waard zou zijn dan zou ado de helft daarvan krijgen een enorm bedrag later wilde swansea dat we met minder dan vijftig procent genoegen namen om de deal door te laten gaan wij hielden gewoon vast aan het contract en hadden verder geen invloed op de verkoop door swansea en het feit dat de transfer niet doorging
9056828 van afslanken van een eerste divisieclub naar het opbouwen van een eredivisieploeg dat is a hell of a job in commercieel opzicht zijn we een heel eind de doelstellingen in dat opzicht zijn voor 95 procent bereikt op vijf businessunits na zijn ze allemaal weg vorig jaar negentien nu dertig dat zegt wel iets er zijn al 3700 seizoenkaarten verkocht en 8500 clubcards ik kan je vertellen dat ado den haag in het nieuwe seizoen de hoogste omzet ooit gaat draaien de inkomsten stijgen van 7 5 miljoen naar 11 miljoen
9056829 nou er is natuurlijk ook een aantal mensen zelf weggegaan maar de meeste mensen waren murw geslagen en hadden niet meer de veerkracht om door te gaan er m est een frisse wind waaien door ado
9056830 e n miljoen veiligheidskosten per jaar is gewoon niet op te brengen wat dat betreft blijft het opvallend dat de gemeente den haag met het nieuwe stadion zo hamerde op de veiligheid en met een pakket eisen kwam terwijl de club de kosten voor zijn rekening moest nemen toenmalige burgmeester deetman heeft toezeggingen gedaan om de veiligheidskosten in de toekomst op een normaal niveau te houden
9056831 voor iedereen in het stadion moet een voetbalwedstrijd van ado den haag een uitje zijn ik ben daar voor het is scheef als er in het businessgebouw wel feest wordt gevierd en aan de andere kant van het stadion niet toen we laatst overleg hadden bij burgemeester van aartsen en we het hadden over gelijkheid voor iedereen grapte hij dan ook maar geen bier meer in de businessclub maar ik ben blij dat er sinds kort voor het eerst weer gepraat kan worden over faciliteiten voor de supporters er moet een biertje komen al dat niet evenementenbier het mag niet de bedoeling zijn dat fans na de wedstrijd hard het stadion uitlopen ze moeten lekker even blijven hangen het is prettig dat onze burgermeester meedenkt en betrokken is we moeten de supporters vertrouwen geven alleen als dat niet beschaamd wordt is het mogelijk goede faciliteiten te organiseren
9056832 nou er zijn nog tal van dingen die we aan het onderzoeken zijn neem de energierekening van ado die is vier ton geloof je dat vier ton heel even heb ik me afgevraagd of er niet een hennepkwekerij onder het zuiderparkstadion ligt
9056833 de hoogte van de spelerssalarissen de prijsverschillen tussen aanvallers en verdedigers niet te vergelijken met werknemers uit het bedrijfsleven en dat veel succesfactoren in een bedrijf overeenkomen met een voetbalclub in essentie verschilt het managen van een bedrijf en een voetbalclub denk ik niet
9056834 jammer natuurlijk het was een apart moment want ik stond aan de rand van de niagara watervallen toen hij belde om af te zeggen de stap voor hem was nog net even te groot maar hij vertelde wel dat het uiteindelijk tussen roda jc en ado den haag ging terwijl hij wel tien aanbiedingen had mensen buiten onze regio zien nog te veel op tegen ado het is aan ons om te bewijzen dat we aan iets goeds bezig zijn wat dat betreft mag ado in sociaal maatschappelijk opzicht minder bescheiden zijn we mogen best meer naar buiten treden met alle activiteiten die ado wat dat betreft in de regio doet

9056868 i can see why people are sceptical of wikipedia because it hasnt gone through a peer review process
9056869 but with wikipedia you have a peer review process thats going on every day that may not involve academics but other people who have differing areas of knowledge
9056870 i also thought this would be a good way of motivating people to produce writing that they will have some pride in if they know other people are going to read it rather than just me
9056871 you can follow the progress of your input as changes and additions are often subject to critical review by other wikipedians
9056872 you are also making a useful contribution to public knowledge by either improving content or accuracy and your it skills are improved
9056873 i think wikipedia itself is a good reference point for further research i dont believe i would cite it in my work but would rather use it to access the original source
9056874 the project will enable me to test the benefits and identify the limitations of wikipedia and wiki technology as tools for improving the evaluative research and writing skills necessary at postgraduate level

9056898 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9056899 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9056900 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9056901 every time you pick up the paper everyone is saying this team will go as their defense goes
9056902 our players are taking hold of that i dont know if itll be a rallying cry or what but i just know this theyll play a lot better than they played last year
9056903 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me

9056941 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9056942 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9056943 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9056961 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
9056962 p rez yoma rechaz duramente el ultim tum de agricultores de la araucan a
9056963 agricultores de temuco dieron 10 d as a p rez yoma para visitar la zona
9056964 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9056965 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9056966 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9056967 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9056968 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9056969 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9056970 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9056971 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9057102 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9057103 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9057104 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington

9057116 for years the ski and snowboard school and race team kids have been exploring these secret spots we just decided to share these well kept secrets with all our guests in the hope that everyone will have more fun
9057117 the idea was to raise awareness among families especially because this is the first layer of barrier and to help people to realize they are not alone and be able to face the problem
9057118 the cast i worked with had no cinematic training which i thought would be useful to access things that a professional actor wouldnt be capable
9057119 usually an actor is trained to show things i thought it was important to show what a person was hiding
9057120 right up to the day of shooting i hadnt found a suitable character to play that role and i even thought about cutting her out
9057121 as it is a very masculine and male oriented society the thought of really coming out and revealing that fact they wanted to come out and revealing they are not a real male has real problems all of the women i met who wanted to be male didnt want this to be known for them it was a real problem coming out

9057124 day to day temps have been fluctuating far more than usual
9057125 the swings make me a little nervous particularly when temps soar to 116 as we saw recently when temps get that high vines can shut down putting the grapes in danger fortunately our grapes are all doing great
9057126 this is the time of year when we visit the vineyards several times a day to see when they start to get their color when the first hints of purple appear on the grapes we know that harvest is right around the corner right now i am ordering all of my harvest supplies and getting my team ready to pick sort and rush the grapes to the winery
9057127 well thats a big question but ill boil it down in simple terms because of the hotter temperatures paso wines tend to be more deeply extracted and big the higher temps lead to higher sugars which in turn lead to higher alcohol when making my wines i strive to deliver big and bold flavors but also wines that hold up when paired with food some of my wines are meant to solo imbibing to be sure but the lexicon that you are enjoying is a great food wine bright acidity and deep fruit dont overpower and are perfect with lighter foods or even hearty entrees
9057128 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
9057129 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9057130 sen mccains selection of alaska gov sarah palin is an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base of his party
9057131 she is a strong executive who hates corruption and puts principle above politics after floating the names of tom ridge and sen joe lieberman in recent weeks selections that would have created consternation among pro family republicans sen mccain has chosen a solid conservative who has a reputation for espousing common sense
9057132 gov palins commitment to the sanctity of life is not just a political position
9057133 she was advised to abort her fifth and youngest child when it was learned he had down syndrome she refused thats bravery and integrity in action
9057134 the selection of governor palin is great news for conservatives for the party and for the country
9057135 her dedication to principle her courage both before and after her election as governor of alaska and her personal qualities make her a perfect choice for vice president i predict any conservatives who have been lukewarm thus far in their support of the mccain candidacy will work their hearts out between now and november for the mccain palin ticket
9057136 sarah palin is an outstanding governor an exemplar of all that is good and true
9057137 she is a major leader in the pro life movement and that is main reason we chose her as our keynote speaker for our life of the party party at this years gop convention
9057138 john mccain has just won the election with this pick
9057139 governor palin will have wide appeal among social conservatives and pro life republicans
9057140 governor palin is a down the line mainstream conservative who will energize the base and reach across party lines attracting women voters independents and blue collar democrats
9057141 with almost one fourth of women voters undecided senator mccain has made a brilliant choice by picking a blue collar conservative woman who will excite the republican party and lay out the welcome matt for independents and disaffected clinton voters
9057142 this week in denver the democrats did a lot of talking about the glass ceiling
9057143 but today the glass ceiling was shattered by not by barack obama and the democrats but by senator mccain governor palin and the republican party
9057144 governor palin also believes that marriage is between one man and one woman
9057145 in a speech in 2006 she expressed her disappointment in an alaskan supreme court ruling ordering that the state provide benefits to same sex partners
9057146 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9057147 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9057148 john mccains choice of sarah palin as his running mate proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose
9057149 for 25 years mccain has opposed a womans right to choose and we know that he will continue to push anti choice policies in the white house mccains pick of anti choice sarah palin is further evidence that his white house will be just another four years of bush style policies any remaining doubts about mccains extreme anti choice position should be put to rest when voters learn about the combined anti choice records of sarah palin and john mccain
9057150 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
9057151 sarah palin not only supported the 1998 alaska constitutional amendment banning marriage equality but in her less than two years as governor even expressed the extreme position of supporting stripping away domestic partner benefits for state workers when you cant even support giving our community the rights to health insurance and pension benefits its a frightening window into where she stands on equality
9057152 fisa amendments act of 2008 and the swell party thrown by at amp t for

9057155 the media did condemn larry craig for his airport restroom follies
9057156 yeah but most of that outrage missed the boat by focusing on how craig floats his who cares how rocks are gotten off no his and ilks real transgression is the hypocritical vote getting anti gay agenda they cynically press until you know one of them gets caught with his pants down

9057175 a republican star was born the triumph came in alaska where sarah palin a politician of eye popping integrity was elected governor she is now the most popular governor in america with an approval rating in the 90s and probably the most popular public official in any state her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success
9057176 i am a conservative republican a firm believer in free market capitalism a free market system allows all parties to compete which ensures the best and most competitive project emerges and ensures a fair democratic process
9057177 some radical feminists will vote straight socialist regardless of circumstances i honestly believe for the first time that mccain and palin can now beat the socks off a democratic ticket which only has a discredited robin hood agenda
9057178 i almost fell over when i heard that mccain picked sarah palin she is great not afraid to take on some of our butthead republicans and call them on the rug for ethics violations like she did to sen stevens and rep don young of alaska who are both under indictment i saw a bumper sticker they have in alaska gov palin coldest state hottest governor ya gotta laugh
9057179 was the most deliberated in the meetings of the auction this week registered a rate of more than 80 of the total trading volumes of the banks participating in the meetings which was the rate of more than 13 banks in a given meeting which is expected because of the weight of government banks and owning the largest proportion of cash assets in the banking system on iraq
9057180 movement in the exchange rate which constitutes a gain of rolling and not necessarily gain the market in general
9057181 the downturn in demand during the last week came as a way to pressure the central bank to show more flexibility toward politics price of the dinar in the auction central bank of iraq
9057182 i think mez is a potentially good young defenseman who had a bit of an off year this past year and weve asked their camp to entertain that in what were trying to do with him
9057183 i think weve made more than a fair offer and put ourselves in a position where he could come here and with some help we think he can be a top player
9057184 everything came out the word would be awesome from our standpoint
9057185 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came through with flying colours obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9057186 he touched on all those things that make america great and all the things americans want to see from education to smart energy to immigration policy to getting out of iraq
9057187 i think the people are ready to take back our country and barack obama is our messenger
9057188 we have so much work to do to make barack obama the next president of the united states
9057189 as a labor lawyer working with families across the state i see them suffer and i see how hard it is to access quality education and healthcare and to pay for bare necessities
9057190 i really really believe in this man because he is the one
9057191 he just cares hes a team player and hes not a soloist
9057192 i think hes someone who is actually going to listen to people because he already has since his days working in south chicago
9057193 this is a representation of the journey my life to this point has been on to improve the lives of others
9057194 what he said about how were in this not for a candidate but for us we have to take responsibility
9057195 this message of change and bringing people together and unifying us just resonated with me
9057196 its because weve had eight years of division that this means so much
9057197 i feel his spirit here rejoicing even though he was assassinated im rejoicing with him and with obama
9057198 i was ready to quite and i met him and he had that light he cared about the real people
9057199 the passion and love he shows for his family he extends to everyone else
9057200 it says in the bible that everything has a time and a place this is the time today
9057201 so many poor people think that is all there is
9057202 but he gives our people hope when we see a young black man be all he can be
9057203 this is a freeing moment for blacks i know i lived the discrimination too
9057204 being able to see the glass ceiling break for minorities and women and to realize there is still an american dream for people has been inspiring
9057205 he cares about peoples concerns those thoughts keep him up at night
9057206 i understood the challenge he was going to go through
9057207 he talked tonight about the changing sentiment in the country and i felt that way when i ran in denver
9057208 its part of the story its what america is its a melting pot thats how it is and i identify with that
9057209 he appeals to us because he is a new generation leader he does not use race he doesnt talk about race its just what it is
9057210 he has really made a strong outreach to indian country and has a definite disability and native american platform
9057211 hes the first candidate since bobby kennedy to visit an indian reservation
9057212 we are all the underdogs and when we unite we are no longer the underdogs and theres an opportunity for all of us in indian country we call it be a part of the circle
9057213 its emotional for me because you see people here of all races of all creeds you see gays you see lesbians you dont see this at the republican convention and thats why i am a democrat
9057214 the olympics bring so much pressure it was easy here
9057215 as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster time my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9057216 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers
9057217 the world record is now closer but im not sure i can do it this year maybe next
9057218 i ran a season best and i plan to improve on that in brussels and stuttgart i want to end up as world number one at the end of the year
9057219 the first three days after the olympics race i was pretty sick to my stomach
9057220 i felt like i was living in a nightmare youre going to be hurt but youve got to pick yourself up again
9057221 i know its been two weeks but im still having nightmares
9057222 so to come out today and have a successful run was really meaningful and probably the best therapy for me
9057223 we wish you well in life we should praise her she is our golden girl take care of her
9057224 if john mccain thinks that he can substitute sarah palin for hillary clinton in the minds of hillary clinton supporters hes sadly mistaken i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9057225 shes been governor of alaska for eighteen months and before that she was the mayor of a town of 8 000 people
9057226 shes already under investigation by her states legislature they voted to spend 100 000 on an investigation because she is accused of firing a state commissioner who refused to fire her sisters husband this is not the kind of change that we need
9057227 she might have been protecting a victim who needed help
9057228 le encanta la atenci n que recibe en las ceremonias y se toma su tiempo para inspeccionar las tropas
9057229 this is only the second month of the fiscal year
9057230 its too early to jump to any conclusions about where collections will be at the end of the fiscal year august collections are actually 1 percent higher than the same month last year
9057231 we are asking people who may want to foster animals or adopt during this time to help us out
9057232 the more animals adopted out of humane society the more they can go to animal control and pull more animals to take to the permanent shelter
9057233 we are trying to get as many animals out of there as possible
9057234 i would call this a life or death manor for these animals at that point
9057235 does not value the company and its future prospects appropriately
9057236 we believe that international rectifiers valuation is still under the cloud of legacy issues
9057237 the first quarter proved to be a more difficult business environment than we anticipated a situation that we believe may continue throughout at least a portion of the remainder of our fiscal year
9057238 lack of a compelling strategic fit with potential buyers makes a timely buyout possible but not likely
9057239 see signs the company was credibly executing toward its fiscal 2010 targets
9057240 we are executing well in this tough environment and are on track to achieve our targets for the year
9057241 we have decided to slow our store and petshotel growth going forward to balance our investment between the productivity of our current asset base and driving market share gains
9057242 the relatively non discretionary nature of this business enables petsmart to maintain unit sales while passing through inflation driving strong consumable comps which offsets weakness in discretionary products
9057243 additionally petsmart benefits from continued movement to higher end foods where there is less competition
9057244 of course we are always excited when women shatter glass ceilings so we are delighted governor palin was given the opportunity to be a vice presidential nominee we were equally excited that sen clinton in the words of gov palin left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america wipp will work with both parties for continued growth of women owned businesses
9057245 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9057246 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment
9057247 we really have to make our minds up are we ready to try and persuade this country to support us for another term because the next 12 months are critical its still there to play for

9057255 great post kevin i always like to hear your perspective on great meetings and presentations
9057256 oh also unsubscribe rate definitely keep an eye on that
9057257 any system that would tax distribution of free samples but exempt sales of the same product just simply does not make sense and disproportionately affects lower income georgians that rely on these free samples as part of their supply of medicines
9057258 as a state that is aggressively marketing our strengths to the life sciences industry taxing these samples used in clinical trials puts us at a disadvantage in attracting research and development activities to georgia
9057259 we are going through a down business cycle like everyone else

9057262 people are having to make cuts and unfortunately thats affecting us
9057263 i thought this might be too good to be true but now im earning over 2000 a week
9057264 what i like about being a web processing specialist is that i have always enjoyed typing and this is a real typing job but i get to work when i want to and set my own schedule youre typing articles which are usually pretty interesting
9057265 i had tried many work at home programs over the years which unfortunately all turned out to be scams but when i read about the program offered by personal computer training institute i just had a feeling that it would let me finally let me live my dream of a job that lets me stay at home and be there for my kids
9057266 i only made 637 in my first month but i was happy because i made back the cost of the course and then some i would definitely recommend the course if you are looking for an interesting way to work at home
9057267 all i can say is that this is the best paying most honest work at home program i have ever found
9057268 they told me i was going to a contending team and that made it a little easier to accept than if i was going to a team that was out of the race that would have been different
9057269 they have a good ballpark for hitters ive always hit well there its close to home
9057270 basically i picked up the schedule and looked at who were playing stuff like that
9057271 i know were one game out going into tonight so its going to be a good race
9057272 you never know i could end up retiring as a coach from the blue jays
9057273 being a canadian player on the only canadian team i wanted to retire as a blue jay but who knows whats going to happen
9057274 maybe i could ask for a one day contract so i can retire as a blue jay
9057275 its early to think about next year we also have to see what the phillies plans are
9057276 they decided they were going in a different direction i understand that thats baseball
9057277 i had a great time in toronto and wish them nothing but the best
9057278 we have no intention of keeping our troops in security zones around south ossetia and abkhazia for the long term
9057279 we will also help south ossetia secure its own border
9057280 it is us who would have initiated this war which we did not do
9057281 the epidemics curve appears to show that we have not yet reached the end of the outbreak because there have still been recent cases
9057282 it is reasonable to believe that these products could pose a threat to public health
9057283 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9057284 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9057285 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9057286 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9057287 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9057288 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9057289 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9057290 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9057291 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9057292 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9057293 with both crude and total oil product inventories running significantly lower than they were when either hurricanes katrina or rita sidelined gulf oil production both oil and gasoline prices are more exposed to potential storm related supply disruptions than they were three years ago
9057294 a comparable hit to production could easily send gasoline prices to new record highs with pump prices in the united states rising to us 5 per gallon and send natural gas prices spiking as well
9057295 the question is whether demand destruction can keep pace with the destruction in supply
9057296 while supply disruptions and attendant price hikes will be temporary there will be lasting impacts from hurricane damage on future supply growth as there have already been from the 2005 storm season
9057297 the general trend to gasoline prices would be flat to slightly lower reflecting a sort of underlying slowing global growth and therefore a slowdown in demand for crude oil
9057298 that should take a further froth off crude oil prices and allow for gasoline prices to slip a bit further
9057299 if there is damage to infrastructure if rigs are offline for more than just a few days for precautionary reasons then you could see oil and gasoline prices move upward temporarily
9057300 however some of this strength reflects inventories built up ahead of the beijing olympics imports will likely fall off in september before picking up later in the year
9057301 as countries often do as new requirements are being discussed we communicate with each other and we express the view that youre referring to and continue to hold the view that the system in place in canada continues to deliver an effective control for listeria monocytogenes in production
9057302 that being said we recognize that the approach the u
9057303 full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
9057304 the cfia fought the concept of daily visits because they figured it was the wrong approach and it was overkill on the part of usda
9057305 all theyve said is the information was available the report was filed somewhere so the inspector could stumble upon it otherwise they didnt bring it to their attention like they were required to do
9057306 innocent people have lost their lives due to consuming something as simple as prepared meat
9057307 not unlike those in walkerton who perished because they drank tap water

9057313 i thank god for people opening their hearts to provide something like this for people like myself who didnt expect to be in this situation i feel like i can breathe now
9057314 a lot of families just need immediate help and theyre over
9057315 i think it kind of speaks to the economy right now
9057316 people are having a hard time more people are losing their jobs and having trouble making the rent
9057317 we found out if we built it they would come

9057328 its not so much how serious a wound will be
9057329 its a wound that requires medical treatment it caused a medical report and the wound was the result of hostile action
9057330 its overdue and the only thing thatll be controversial is those people wounded since the end of the cold war who wont get it
9057331 history must have its own way of calling an eyewitness for in all those sleepless nights i had endured in the past last night was the most different instead of going through an entire nocturnal phase watching cartoons and news my body surrendered at half past midnight i was asleep peacefully only to awakened three hours later by my own body clock
9057332 and the high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule or to impose himself in any other way

9057394 it is very difficult to look at an incomplete structure and realize the value of not only the land but the zoning engineering materials and labor that have already been invested
9057395 our clients are looking at the cost to complete the project the current market for resale and the investors overall roi
9057396 we at unfinished construction recognize there is a current demand due to market conditions especially foreclosures to complete a wide range of projects
9057397 our company can help sellers find buyers and investors and assist in the non traditional real estate market referred to as out of the ordinary we can also assist in locating contractors who will be able to finish the project or locate resources to help finance the project to full completion within that market
9057398 the airport is the first and last place in minnesota most conventioneers will see and we want the experience to be positive and to reflect well on the state as a whole
9057399 we worked with the non partisan convention host committee to integrate the airport into metro wide welcome and transportation plans our goal is to ensure visitors have a seamless airport experience and hopefully get a sense of the state and the community while theyre here
9057400 airport police met with state federal and local law enforcement agencies for nearly two years to develop and implement a comprehensive security plan for continued safe efficient airport operations
9057401 travelers will notice increased police presence on and around the airport extra k 9 teams and new electronic screening devices that can identify anyone carrying possible explosives

9057406 street protests are short cuts which can be used once but not all the time if you want to change things go to the country side and create a revolution which generates that mass support and then win the election thats the democratic way
9057407 hey its my money and i want you to spend it the right way
9057408 overthrowing another government would seem only to undermine the dysfunctional democracy here
9057409 the police are not using violence they are merely going into the government house to protect the people

9057423 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9057424 who you are speaks so loud i can barely hear what you say
9057425 todays budget vote was neither courageous nor productive it was more of the same from liberal politicians who would rather pick the pockets of hardworking families instead of cutting wasteful spending
9057426 assembly republicans commend our senate republican colleagues for defending hard working californians from billions in higher taxes and billions in new spending by standing united against the senate democrat budget
9057427 their irresponsible budget would have hurt working families by increasing the state sales tax threatened public safety byincluding a dangerous direct discharge parole scheme and done nothing to reform our broken budget system
9057428 now that the senate has joined the assembly in rejecting a budget proposal containing tax increases i hope we can finally get serious about working together to reach consensus on an honest budget compromise we must come together to craft a state budget that helps california live within its means improves our economy and protects californians from higher taxes

9057457 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9057458 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9057459 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9057460 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time

9057483 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
9057484 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
9057485 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
9057486 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
9057487 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
9057488 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
9057489 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
9057490 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

9057506 i kind of expected mccains pick was not going to be something that was going to be the conventional pick knowing him the way i know him it was going to be an out of the box type of selection and this caught everybody by surprise
9057507 her name wasnt mentioned it came down to the tim pawlentys the mitt romneys but i think that whatever bounce the obama campaign gets and they will its going to be deflated quickly with sarah palin when shes introduced
9057508 last night senator barack obama had a chance to address all the sexism and misogyny that was leveled in this campaign against hillary clinton and he chose not to take that
9057509 so in terms of sitting well with women on the democratic side we see that john mccain gets it john mccain selected a qualified woman with a lot of experience and accomplishments to be his running mate as opposed to barack obama who chose against the person that got more votes than anyone in history so i think that thats actually whats sitting poorly with women right now
9057510 actually when you look at sarah palin you see that she is a family woman shes a mother of five you see that in alaska she has an incredibly strong record as a reformer
9057511 so i think thats where peoples concern is going to be that its a person with accomplishment and experience whos been chosen she just happens to be a woman as well
9057512 the text was obscured without any explanation as to why
9057513 our suspicions were confirmed by staff who told us that following a complaint from a single religious fundamentalist the museum had been instructed to cover up the offending statement
9057514 by this action the council would appear to be endorsing the views of a religious minority and denying the right of the rest of us to see the results of rational and scientific thought
9057515 evolution is not an extreme view not to be mentioned in respectable
9057516 its particularly sad that in the 21st century we appear to have a council with 19th century attitudes
9057517 id be interested to hear how the council justifies this censorship and who ordered the cover up
9057518 preferably they should reinstate the complete panel immediately if they havent got the courage to do this they should at least put up a statement telling all that they have a policy of allowing censorship by religious minorities
9057519 our museum team covered part of a display board following a complaint about a small section of the wording
9057520 the team agreed the wording was poorly worded and could cause offence we took the decision to obscure part of it rather than spend tax payers money on a replacement
9057521 the team agreed the wording was poorly worded and could cause offence
9057522 the team agreed the wording was poorly worded and could cause offence
9057523 you have the right to be offended but you do not have the right to silence me even if you are offended
9057524 we all were involved in the doe matter it should not be blamed on one person
9057525 they had signed doe off the book because they were interested in sawyers interim leadership
9057526 a government can not hold into account a truce signed with rebels
9057527 we carried him on the base while ecomog took care of his soldiers whether they died or escaped i do not know
9057528 if the death of the thirteen men the death of tolbert the death of journalist charles gbenyon general thomas quiwonkpa and many others were televised i too decided to televise does death so that people would see it
9057529 men were put in a combat against the regime that murdered their children i said sorry to doe family am i a coward to continue to say sorry have you heard with your ears that the krahn people have come to tell the nimba people sorry
9057530 does regime did not favor my people they killed them like chickens and created sleepless nights for them what do you expect me to do to a man reflecting my mind on atrocities most of does children were born by women from nimba county yet he treated our people cruelly should i have given room to human rights to stall the things that i wanted done
9057531 sawyer was extraordinarily wicked after we had vowed to have him serve as the interim leader and brought him to monrovia as a leader on a platter of gold he called us thieves when he changed the liberian bank notes
9057532 sawyer is ungrateful he siphoned some the money and allegedly built his home in the us when sawyer was interim leader he stole money which he did nothing with neither did he account for it now he is made chairperson of the countrys governance commission what will happen to the country sawyer is corrupt
9057533 i tied journalist isaac bantu for suppressing my release i tied him seriously and had him in my living room at my base for seven hours
9057534 michael doe died of misinformation from former miss liberia annie broaderick that angered me annie said that michael brought the npfl to attack us and that he was collaborating with doe soldiers so he was shot in the chest his death was not intentional
9057535 i turned over to ecomog and my men went through the ddrr process
9057536 if youve been foreclosed on and you have a lien against your home or if youre in financial trouble due to general economic conditions and you arent able to pay your assessments that creates some major problems for the association
9057537 some associations are assessing 10 000 20 000 or 30 000 per unit the buildings are 30 or 40 years old and they need renovations some owners are defaulting and then thats another 10 000 20 000 or 30 000 that the rest of the homeowners need to make up
9057538 awareness is always better than uncertainty dont just stand on the sidelines and condemn and criticize
9057539 the best option is to be as frugal as possible and if there is still a shortfall they should do the one thing that associations can do which is to assess the owners as necessary
9057540 if a minority of the homeowners cant afford the assessments maybe those owners need to find another place to live if most of the owners cant afford the assessments the association needs to redo its budget and figure out ways to keep the expenses down the board cant fashion the budget for those who cant pay
9057541 if a hot dog at the church carnival costs fifty cents how many dimes would that be
9057542 arg that one was tougher soon enough though my tiny fist shot up filled with four fake quarters i was learning
9057543 go to school get good grades and look for a safe secure job
9057544 the avoidance of money is just as psychotic as being attached to money
9057545 the primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they handle fear of failure in their lives for most people the fear of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich
9057546 the fear of being different prevents most people from seeking new ways to solve their problems
9057547 hay una serie de eventos que vienen ocurriendo que apuntan hacia una campa a para intentar criminalizar nuestras luchas por esto es necesario hacer un llamado de atenci n al gobierno nacional para que analicen lo que est ocurriendo e investiguen a funcionarios involucrados y cese la criminalizaci n y los juicios contra trabajadores dirigentes y dem s ciudadanos que reclaman y defienden sus derechos hay que impulsar una campa a en defensa de los derechos de los que luchan
9057548 si vemos los hechos del conflicto de los yupkas donde hubo una fuerte represi n por parte de la guardia nacional y la detenci n de periodistas de medios comunitarios la represi n que se ha desatado contra trabajadores que han ocupado fabricas como son los casos de sanitarios maracay y sincreba en m rida o lo que vimos contra los sidoristas durante su justa lucha para un contrato colectivo digno y la nacionalizaci n y los casos de dirigentes obreros en distintos partes del pa s que est n frente juicios como los de fundimeca simplemente por defender los derechos de los trabajadores podemos ver como la derecha est usando su control sobre partes de instituciones del estado sea la guardia nacional o sea los tribunales para intentar criminalizar nuestras luchas
9057549 en todos estos casos vemos que luego de 10 a os de revoluci n todav a quedan pendiente muchas tareas y una de ellas es la depuraci n de las instituciones del estado
9057550 hace por lo menos 7 a os que este pueblo ind gena est enfrentando las mafias y sicarios de los terratenientes quienes tomaron por la fuerza sus tierras hace 30 a os atr s
9057551 si no fuera por la campa a de los medios alternativos como aporrea donde se ha denunciado la represi n brutal en contra de estudiantes y periodistas que fueron a apoyar a los yupkas la detenci n de cuarto de ellos por la guardia nacional y el cerco alrededor de la comunidad yupka limitando acceso a los que vinieron a apoyarlos todav a este caso no hubiera salido a ver la luz del d a
9057552 otra vez como fue el caso de la lucha de los sidoristas contra la represi n de la guardia nacional fue el presidente hugo ch vez en su ultimo alo presidente el que se puso a frente para denunciar que las cosa no pueden seguir como estaban hasta ahora cabe preguntar por qu dado el claro papel nefasto de estos terratenientes en colaboraci n con oficiales de la guardia nacional el inti y otras instituciones del estado ninguna otra persona del gobierno y de las otras instituciones del estado ll mase asamblea nacional o ministerio p blico sali a denunciar todo esto
9057553 este es otro ejemplo donde a las claras se demuestra que aun todav a dentro el estado revolucionario existen muchos escu lidos y contrarrevolucionarios que en conchupancia con patronos enfrentan y enjuician a los trabajadores
9057554 no es el nico caso de intentos a criminalizar los que claramente son conflictos laborales por eso es necesario impulsar un campa a conjunto con todos los corrientes que hacen vida en el movimiento sindical junto con las organizaciones sociales para defender todos estos compa eros y compa eros sea los yupkas o los de fundimeca u otra empresa
9057555 este campa a tiene que levantar los reclamos en estos caso con una sola voz para denunciar los intentos a criminalizar estas luchas y es m s tiene que jugar un papel fundamental e impulsando la depuraci n del estado venezolano si de verdad queremos ir hacia el socialismo es obvio que esto ser imposible con un sistema judicial que perjudica las luchas de los despose dos que apuntan en esta direcci n estos jueces y fiscales como todos los que ocupan cargos p blicos deben ser servidores del pueblo y no de los terratenientes y empresarios por eso no basta solamente remociones porque luego siempre terminan apareciendo en otro puesto esas personas deben ser electos por las comunidades con un mandato revocable solo as podemos ir hacia un verdadero estado revolucionario

9057678 lo que hemos convenido con los sectores que producen o importan alimentos es que el proceso de adecuaci n va en el lapso m s perentorio posible para colocar la informaci n nutricional precios y ese conjunto de factores de presentaci n de los productos

9057688 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9057689 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9057690 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9057691 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9057692 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9057693 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9057694 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9057695 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9057696 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9057697 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9057698 we sympathize with the family and we never meant for any of this to happen but please help me bring my dogs home
9057699 these dogs are not running around the neighborhood like a pack of wild animals this was an accident and that will come out if and when a hearing occurs
9057700 state law gives a dog a second chance if a dog is deemed dangerous and then bites someone it can be destroyed but broward has taken that away
9057701 is this a situation where this family and these dogs lost their right to live because of this horrible accident thats what this law suggests
9057702 they are not vicious animals they are not dangerous everyone in my neighborhood knows my dogs they come to visit my dogs and interact with my dogs
9057703 its sad for all parties concerned for the owners of tinkerbell as well as for the owners of these dogs said lisa mendheim of broward animal care and regulation

9057708 absolutely not you know months ago they were talking about decisions were going to be made behind closed doors this was democracy at its best
9057709 involved you know you look at the everything the people the surroundings the colors the imagery it reminds you of athenian democracy
9057710 i think it was a home run shes a beautiful woman you know her hugs are genuine she has those beautiful high cheek bones that we see in models the broad shoulders look how wide her stance is her gestures are huge theyre very encompassing these things draw us in
9057711 that was one of the criticisms though you said athenian that the temples made it look i mean the columns made it look a little bit too much like a temple like this was meant to worship barack obama as a god
9057712 not at all this was about that you know we use the images of these columns from athens to tell us about our history of democracy about openness about the people and we have a great example of this where this has been opened up i think for the first time and may set a precedent for future conventions very powerful
9057713 well you see them and theyre its a similitude this is a similitude of the white house and you see them walking off into right here this is showing us hey were normal just like you we are a family very very powerful images here we havent seen these by the way since the kennedys
9057714 yeah with the two little kids and the elegant wife i sort of was reminded of that as well
9057715 this is extremely powerful theyre going to be talking about this for a very long time very tough to top

9057752 the california proposal seeks to limit sprawl not by enacting some manner of harsh prohibition but instead by limiting state participation in providing easy highway access for new communities in the outlying exurbs if the state is unwilling to build new highway interchanges access to the new areas will be more curtailed and there will be less incentive to turn these areas into new tracts of carpet bombing houses without ready freeway access new developments in more outlying regions will be less attractive to commuting families and the growth of these developments will be less rapid

9057767 as the baby boom generation of corporate leaders and experts approaches retirement businesses in the u s canada and many european nations face the loss of experience and knowledge on an unprecedented scale
9057768 younger workers cant be counted on to fill the void as they lack the experience that builds deep expertise they also tend to change jobs frequently taking their technological savvy and any knowledge theyve gained with them
9057769 while the process may seem long and complex it can sometimes be accomplished quickly in practice
9057770 but several iterations through the process may be necessary when the knowledge is deep complex or large in scope

9057797 but lets state this flatly right here right now where you dont attack palin is based on her looks based on her femininity based on her being a mother based on her xx genotype sarah palin is a former miss alaska and conventionally attractive but that doesnt mean her mind is irrelevant to the discussion that her experience as a mayor or governor is somehow worthless palin should be judged in the same way any other candidate for the vice presidency should be judged on her merit as a candidate and a leader period attack her record and attack her experience those must be on the table but her gender that should be off the table period
9057798 dod recognizes that there are substantial insecurities in the defense industrial base
9057799 in a worst case scenario these insecurities could lead to the injection of malicious code into the operating software of a weapons platform
9057800 rfis such as this recent one the army put out are one method
9057801 another way would be to simply invite industry to demonstrate different methodologies systems and technologies that they are using that can be transported to government
9057802 however industry in general is behind the government in terms of processes and procedures for protecting sensitive information on it systems
9057803 one exception to this would be in the financial and banking industries and while they are probably the most advanced in this area there might be some reluctance to share their methodologies
9057804 e government expansion has been somewhat limited due to security concerns and the war on terror

9057809 the days where a person has a job for life are long gone so its perverse that the generation y psyche appears to show less adaptability efficiency and dynamism than older generations
9057810 the 20 somethings we studied were also less resilient less confident at negotiation and decision making less influential in a leadership capacity and less able or willing to follow the rules all of which is concerning for the future
9057811 but there were positives too in stark contrast to popular perceptions of surly selfish and aggressive youth the younger generation claims to have a stronger ethical code is more socially aware and more in tune with others behaviour than their elders
9057812 perhaps because of growing up in the 1960s radicalism still shapes the baby boomer psyche
9057813 they remain more adaptable to change than younger people very much confounding the view that you cant teach an old dog new tricks
9057814 but baby boomers also perhaps understandably show signs of easing down as they approach retirement showing less ambition and competitiveness than other generations

9057877 ive shut down 70 schools brought in a new principal who selected a new team and they are operating in a more effective way
9057878 we had high schools that had a 30 per cent graduation rate i shut those schools down and replaced them with smaller high schools in the same building and some of those schools now have a 70 or 80 per cent graduation rate
9057879 we re putting an emphasis on linemen it s hard to replace the speed of zach and jacque but we re trying our best
9057880 it s going to be tough but i have a lot of young kids who feel they can make the same impact
9057881 not a single move in player who can help the varsity shocking

9057883 uh hey just to let you know i see a ghost in your bathroom
9057884 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9057885 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9057886 the greatest end zone dance of all time has to be cuba gooding jr
9057887 the way we played tonight was superb and we definitely deserved the victory
9057888 in fact i am surprised we did not score more goals we deserved to win by a bigger margin
9057889 tottenham did not offer the 22 million pounds 40 28 million we wanted for him and what we think he is worth they offered 16 million pounds and with respect that is not enough so thats the end of it
9057890 we played our best when we were 2 0 down
9057891 we put a good effort in it was a warm night and there are tired players out there
9057892 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9057893 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9057894 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9057895 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9057896 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9057897 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9057898 all they have to do is call me and ask me for something like that and its an immediate yes
9057899 we dont have the time to go out and be the true workers which are the volunteers that spend a year in africa
9057900 we dont have that liberty but we can definitely do our part back here just to get people to realize what its all about
9057901 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches
9057902 i wish i would win nice and in a simple way just cruise through the match and thats it
9057903 i schedule my life around my life not his life
9057904 i was gone for dinner and he decided to do it quick so i missed it
9057905 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore so that was that was problem
9057906 no i feel good in both i have no preference
9057907 of course theres days youre like maybe next match youd rather play at night you can sleep in and have more time
9057908 depends a little bit the scheduling but i dont feel superior in the day session or the night sessions
9057909 ive been at a lot of different places and been underdogs in a lot of different games
9057910 you go into each game coaching just as hard and preaching to your players hey youve got a chance
9057911 what would happen i dont know im sure in some ways good things would come from it but id rather not learn lessons that way
9057912 i expect our guys to go down there and block tackle and not jump offsides and do the fundamental things that a good football team does
9057913 who we are playing doesnt have anything to do with us taking care of the football on saturday
9057914 any team can win on any day that was proven last year
9057915 if we come out and were lollygagging and everybodys kind of like usc usc thats whats going to happen were going to have a michigan appalachian state
9057916 you learn a lot of different ways but for me the best way to learn is to go out there and experience it for yourself
9057917 i think troy and kyle have separated themselves from joe in terms of being ready to line up and win a football game for us at this level
9057918 i would have to say it hurt him it retarded his development because he never got a chance to really learn
9057919 the great thing about it is i dont think i have to give out that information at this time
9057920 it looked as though he was about to get that nod
9057921 we had a quarterback who very well could have been our starter miss all that time so well kind of have to factor that into the equation as we go forward
9057922 but by the same token hes had a lot of reps from the very first minicamp on through so he knows our offense
9057923 i think joe is in a place where he can compete for us as opening day starter
9057924 now whether thats the best thing for us well have to see in the next four or five days but hes handled himself very well
9057925 hopefully i can get back but health is more important right now because its a long season and i feel the team is going to need me more down the line than early
9057926 i feel like were in the beginning stages of being able to be to put our best foot forward
9057927 with our absolute best group that we can put out on the field
9057928 we have to deal with the reality of his knee not responding well right now
9057929 i dont know if we can afford as a team to keep him active unless he can predict that he can come through
9057930 i think hes going to have to play with some soreness
9057931 thats going to be a battle i think thats a very close battle
9057932 hes been a great part of this offense but were just evaluating and i thought stephon came in and did a pretty job
9057933 needs to continue to mature mentally in the passing game
9057934 thats the history of this offense basically is the passing game has been behind the run game the defense the special teams
9057935 and then as it comes on then you start hitting on all cylinders
9057936 if he doesnt progress well and doesnt practice this week i probably will hold him out
9057937 one rumor on which mariotti would not comment had him bound for boston and an array of multimedia opportunities
9057938 i also did experiments on observers under the influence of marijuana and found that
9057939 a feature matching model has difficulty making predictions because of the familiar problems what constitutes a feature by microsoft research
9057940 this is going to be a real good test for us because theyre going to come out and throw the ball at least 40 times
9057941 its a way for the secondary to make a name for ourselves in the first game
9057942 the michigan game was really a wake up call for us
9057943 we did not stop them the whole day they were up and down the field now when you go into the offseason at least you have something to point to when guys start thinking about how good they think they are
9057944 all you had to do is just turn on the film and just say hey guys lets just go back to last season and lets look at that and well see how good we really think we are
9057945 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve
9057946 this game just because of what happened last year is going to be an early test for us
9057947 we had the mentality that other teams got in three extra weeks of work so we had to catch up
9057948 regardless of whether we brought everyone back from last years team its still a different team
9057949 were building that right now i dont see anyone complacent or sitting on the fact we were super bowl champions last year
9057950 stray was kind of the face but a p was the leader every day at training camp
9057951 he has always been a vocal leader we have plenty of veteran guys stray left an imprint for sure even without him i am still going to envision him stomping someone out before every game
9057952 you have to move forward and you cant dwell on it
9057953 with the predictions and the opinions we could really care less those are the same people that last year told us we wouldnt do nothing
9057954 i think from a mental standpoint guys are even more focused than they were last year and ready to get off to a fast start
9057955 we just have to work hard on that and just be consistent week in and week out
9057956 i think that has been our motivation and we know we have to do that

9057991 so thats been a pattern its always seemed to me thats the right thing to do gift of screws as an album wasnt really finished so i was trying to do the right thing for the good of the whole
9057992 i didnt really go in there and plan to make a rocking album
9057993 for whatever reason this seems to hearken back to earlier work fleetwood mac in particular i think thats something the record company recognizes and feels good about
9057994 speaking as a private individual i would not vote for john mccain under any circumstances

9058002 i went ran to the fire escape and i put a blanket over my face pushing at the fire escape
9058003 i remember them pulling the ladder out real quick and he was climbing up the ladder
9058004 i remember him telling me to turn around but i tried to turn around i guess
9058005 my heart stopped and they rushed me to see what was wrong
9058006 they thought i had a blood clot or something and then my heart started going again

9058012 smiling and kicking and cooing all that stuff 6 month olds are supposed to do
9058013 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and season was coming up
9058014 did i want to just like quit and give up and just be here all the time and just be with her oh definitely this is my daughter man i only had her 3 months
9058015 we noticed the same pattern when we looked at changes in wiki pages virginia governor tim kaine and some of the other potential democratic candidates
9058016 we saw a lot of accuracy and footnote changes on bidens while on kaines page there were a few but not too many also a couple of the same editors were working on both the obama and biden wiki pages
9058017 sometimes youll have personnel at private airports who see activity and discuss it on blogs and forums saying hey i noticed this person leaving in the dead of night
9058018 it feels good in a humble way im a confident guy but im not a cocky guy
9058019 theres another side of me that honestly knows that all fame is fleeting

9058022 i was like if my lifes going to be short im going to enjoy it
9058023 i didnt want to do this show and it became everything i wasnt
9058024 its meant to be entertaining but its also very real
9058025 the first day of filming i tell all the girls look this is not a white picket fence and were getting married
9058026 im not in competition with them but it surely raises the bar

9058034 should fire the chairman and architect of this woeful strategy himself
9058035 it was 2 in the morning or so and it seemed like johns father had been sleeping before it happened
9058036 he got to the point pretty quickly after we got moving
9058037 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long
9058038 he wanted to get home he just said no more of that the important thing was that we not jeopardize anything for ourselves
9058039 that man did things for this country that few people could go through never forget that
9058040 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9058041 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9058042 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9058043 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9058044 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9058045 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9058046 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9058047 the landscape is littered with the bodies of those who have crossed sarah

9058052 we came for shorter this time three days not seven we didnt rent a house we stayed in a motel
9058053 they definitely spent a lot less money people were much pickier and they shared a lot more food they didnt spend on the big ticket item
9058054 they really just picked out select things for certain people they had budgets and they stuck to them this year
9058055 we have been holding our breathe for the season to see how the economy would affect us to everyones relief visitors still came down
9058056 sums up the mood of irish who just wanted to kill some british
9058057 i actually think if we deal with global warming in a way which raises peoples energy bills we will have blown it
9058058 mckinsey says roughly the first half of what we have to do is a good investment and when you make a good investment in efficiency your bills dont go up now the second half is going to be tougher but hopefully by that time we will have new technology
9058059 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
9058060 at a time when many republicans are still clinging to pork barrel politics governor palin has quickly become a leader on this issue
9058061 she is a principled reformer who understands how badly wasteful spending has marred the republican brand
9058062 un carr blanc sur fond noir cest pas de lart
9058063 that was the biggest round of my career it was not the front nine i wanted but it was the back nine i needed
9058064 i was playing very well but the greens were ridiculous
9058065 they were really bumpy all you could do is hit a good stroke and hope it was really really disappointing
9058066 oh well it is nice to be told what to do by one so young and one so inexperienced
9058067 can you believe he said that the only reason that we said a hotline to faldo is because he is the only one saying it
9058068 no one is he did say he has spoken to nick has anyone else said that no right then it is nick faldos decision
9058069 not necessarily i dont think that necessarily proves that you are on form or not a good solid performance does nowadays in europe if you finish from 10th up you are performing quite well because it is tough to win and you have to be fortunate at the right times
9058070 never in any of my 41 victories have i stood up and said i was unlucky ever
9058071 but im happy and glad to end my international career here in zurich
9058072 im happy i was still able to run with the best after 12 wins here and my memories will last very long
9058073 its a good place to run my last international race
9058074 but it is time for me to come to a decision about this one must be realistic in life my form is not bad but ill admit that im far from my best performances now
9058075 i have never doubted that john mccain is the right person to lead us through these tough times sen mccain is the president to deal with our countrys two pressing challenges restoring our economy and bringing tough visionary leadership on national security today i am just as certain that gov sarah palin of alaska is the superb vice president we need for america right now gov palin is known in alaska as a rock solid executive and a no nonsense reformer of what had been wide spread corruption in that states politics with this breakthrough choice john mccain and sarah palin are poised to usher in a new wave of change and reform to a washington that has stopped working for the people of america i look forward to joining president mccain and vice president palin this january to make this change work for people right here in the commonwealth
9058076 sarah palin is a popular and proven reformer with a record of accomplishment and real executive experience
9058077 heres the way to look at mccain picking sarah palin as his running mate hillary clinton has been replaced by the other woman again
9058078 shes younger than barack obama and has held the governors office for less time than hes been in the senate 2006 versus 2004 for obama she has not served in elected office above that of mayor prior to her gubernatorial victory she has not yet been tested in any kind of major media election process
9058079 sen john mccain would have to abandon any inexperience attacks on sen obama experience may be a strength more with general election voters than democrats who have been choosing the lesser experienced obama over sen clinton
9058080 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief said spokeswoman dana perino
9058081 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy ms perino cautioned
9058082 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years
9058083 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama she underlined
9058084 the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture but the speech also
9058085 the president will thank his family his administration and most of all the friends supporters and volunteers in the convention hall who have supported him and the republican agenda for these past eight years
9058086 some of the attacks are just out and out false for example suggesting that the bush administration hasnt invested in alternative or renewable energies
9058087 were in high political season were not going to let it get to us were going to focus on the big picture she said
9058088 above all the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief amp squo amp squo said spokeswoman dana perino
9058089 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9058090 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9058091 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9058092 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9058093 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9058094 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9058095 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9058096 everything was clean there were a number of tests and josh came thought with flying colors obviously we hoped for that we needed to get some closure
9058097 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9058098 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9058099 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9058100 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9058101 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9058102 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9058103 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9058104 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9058105 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9058106 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9058107 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9058108 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9058109 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9058110 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9058111 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9058112 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9058113 traditionally september is a weak month for stocks and i dont think were going to escape that
9058114 i do think we are going to stay in a trading range i dont see this market falling out of bed and going below the july lows
9058115 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9058116 it wasnt a georgian attack on tskhinvali that launched all of this
9058117 it was russian pressure over a long period of time and then shelling coming from south ossetians
9058118 was not a wise thing to do because as weve seen russia was prepared to launch a major invasion
9058119 today it is a fight between the civilized and the uncivilized worlds
9058120 the olympics bring so much pressure it was easy here as im starting to get a cold i was not able to think about any faster time my coach told me that i should make sure to end the season healthy
9058121 but this was my best race with the best pacemakers
9058122 the world record is now closer but im not sure i can do it this year maybe next
9058123 i ran a season best and i plan to improve on that in brussels and stuttgart i want to end up as world number one at the end of the year
9058124 the first three days after the olympics race i was pretty sick to my stomach
9058125 i felt like i was living in a nightmare youre going to be hurt but youve got to pick yourself up again
9058126 i know its been two weeks but im still having nightmares
9058127 so to come out today and have a successful run was really meaningful and probably the best therapy for me
9058128 if people give you a shelter you should take it
9058129 gustav could become a major hurricane near the time it crosses western cuba
9058130 the rise of sites such as facebook and bebo has dramatically changed the way teenagers in particular invite friends to their parties
9058131 sharp contraction in refinancing options for borrowers and stricter lending criteria
9058132 its great to see that people are quite rightly prioritising their mortgage payments ahead of other financial commitments having a smaller mortgage can mean you get a better deal when you remortgage and of course reduces future monthly outgoings
9058133 its about time someone took this step and hopefully others will follow helping to safeguard against perilous lending this announcement however is only relevant for lender valuations which are for the benefit of the lender not the purchaser
9058134 customers have a right to be treated fairly and be given correct and relevant information to make informed decisions
9058135 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers
9058136 however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now
9058137 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for
9058138 it is plain to see the devastating effect the government is having on the housing market as it keeps tight lipped about the possibility of a

9058142 were concerned that two thirds of people are over estimating the costs of protection

9058144 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
9058145 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb
9058146 although most retired homeowners have seen the value of equity in their homes fall in recent months its important that they dont lose sight of the bigger picture which is that despite current falling property prices in the vast majority of cases retired homeowners have built up a significant amount of equity in their homes over a number of years
9058147 a number of brokers are now seeing debt management as an absolutely crucial route to bolstering their own income
9058148 many have seen their mortgage and re mortgage business significantly diminish which is not only impacting their own earning opportunities but making it difficult for them to help clients who are facing financial difficulties
9058149 a eurodebt debt management plan provides a viable alternative that enables the broker to retain client relationships and our marketing toolkit which is unique in the sector means brokers can promote this service with only limited outlay from their own business we recommend that prospective introducers request a copy of our marketing support catalogue to establish just what is possible to boost their income many of the templates have been used to target tens of thousands of prospective clients
9058150 whilst a number of debt management providers are now offering opportunities for brokers and ifas to promote their services we believe eurodebt is unique in investing in an extensive marketing support toolkit to support brokers facing particularly difficult conditions and provide future revenue generation opportunities because they are still actively involved with their client
9058151 as a mortgage broker i have found selling wills to clients old and new a natural extension to what i have been doing for years
9058152 a client who has faced a mortgage or secured finance decline could be offered a eurodebt debt management programme giving brokers a crucial way to help their clients whilst also earning generous referral fees
9058153 the investment we are making in our new roadshow means brokers will have the opportunity to find out first hand how the eurodebt introducer scheme could work for them we recognise that many brokers are under pressure time wise so our goal is to bring the information they need right to their doorstep
9058154 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low

9058157 i dont get upset because i have answered this question many times theres no need to explain anymore
9058158 we certainly are looking at the new ordinance and we take the position that the new ordinance is another attempt by the city to regulate in an area of immigration an area that is clearly only given to the federal government

9058211 there is a long way to go to get up to that level in all honesty
9058212 this summer like last summer the jet stream has been a long way south much further south than we would normally expect it to be

9058217 fresh water is a product whose relative economic value has risen substantially and will keep rising in the coming years
9058218 it has become a growing source of wealth and an increasingly worthwhile investment opportunity
9058219 markets for water and thus its export handled with transparency flexibility and solid regulation could improve substantially the way water is managed and used in quebec

9058266 after aces was passed conocophillips alaskas most active oil exploration company and one of the top three producers announced it was canceling plans to build a diesel fuel refinery at the kuparuk oil field conocophillips blamed the cancellation on passage of aces the new tax the refinery would have allowed the company to produce low sulfur diesel fuel onsite for its vehicles and other uses on the north slope rather than haul the fuel there from existing refineries

9058276 will sunday be strange i am 100 per cent for villa thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
9058277 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 per cent for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
9058278 will the fans all be behind me all i can do is give 100 per cent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
9058279 it has been a long summer there was continuous speculation but i feel i am strong enough mentally and ill be fine with it all now
9058280 am i here for the long haul i always take things a season at a time this speculation happened at the end of last season and it has been decided ill be staying at villa
9058281 ill take this season now concentrate on that and hopefully we can improve on last season
9058282 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between scotland and england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
9058283 tevez was outstanding he was fantastic we had some of the best chances in the match but that happens
9058284 ibrahima has agreed to join stoke and he has signed a three year deal
9058285 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players i said something to peter a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch
9058286 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come
9058287 first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
9058288 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
9058289 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names
9058290 this is a player that we wanted to sign and i am happy that he is coming to hearts
9058291 i dont want the fans to think that i want to leave
9058292 i am happy at west ham i have just had a baby and i dont want to go anywhere i am really settled in my life and only want to work hard and do well for west ham
9058293 i am just looking forward to a bright future and when the time is right the deal will be done
9058294 all i am thinking about is pushing on this season and scoring more goals that is my main objective
9058295 i am happy with my current situation and hopefully i can carry on playing games and doing my best for west ham
9058296 steven gerrard has had the operation it was not serious but he will not be available until after the international break
9058297 i have spoken today to fabio capello about the situation he asked me how steven was and it was a good conversation everything was positive between us and i have explained to him the timing and when he will be fit
9058298 we had no option but to have the operation done now there will be another international break soon anyway and we could not wait any longer
9058299 it is a season long deal with the option to buy at the end of it
9058300 he is very happy about moving to england and everton and linking up with yakubu and the other nigerian players at everton
9058301 its not our decision on who he spends his money on nor will it ever be our decision if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30m can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes we totally back him its his decision theres a dual problem for him if we were to buy star names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way arsene plays they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters whove been brought up through
9058302 all i know is that park chu young attended training today and there is a big chance that he will play at the weekend
9058303 lets not talk about what may happen and talk about what is happening
9058304 i dont think a player should be able to play for two clubs in the same competition in the same season and i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
9058305 i also think we have to look at the summer and winter transfer windows
9058306 i have a feeling we can put this story to bed
9058307 i think with the purchase of pavlyuchenko the idea of arshavin moving to london no longer exists
9058308 like i said about robbo yesterday i want as many good footballers at the club as possible and robert fits into that category
9058309 he has become an important member of the squad over the past 19 months and has a terrific attitude
9058310 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
9058311 our squad is complete and it is impossible for us to have one better than the one we have
9058312 robinho still has two years left on his contract therefore he is our player for the next two seasons so you can draw your own conclusions from that
9058313 its like they live in an ivory tower they complain that we take traffic business from them but we dont get a share of that traffic so why should i care
9058314 some races run along predefined tracks while others allow you to run anywhere in the world in any direction
9058315 it is like a computer game except that you are not controlling the player you are the player
9058316 we like to provide as many services as possible for free we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources
9058317 those are things were looking at and learning how we can provide a service without people having to pay
9058318 but we still get our operation running with funding from somewhere so that we can maintain the level of quality we want
9058319 were more open about approaching and bringing services in to ps3 and psp we cant support all the needs of the consumer and there are great companies providing services on the pc already so were very open to provide the opportunity to those companies to reach our user base as well
9058320 we did enough to get through on the tie and we did very well out in iceland but even so we can improve immensely on that performance
9058321 we are in the process of talking to the government
9058322 theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
9058323 while we visited la fem they showed us a new wet mill which is a machine that separates the coffee bean from the fruit pulp crs provided it and we were asked to bless it as they looked forward to a more efficient processing of the coffee crop this year the women now have a growing business selling fair trade organic shade grown coffee which is among the highest quality possible they have paid back the initial loan and their children are now dreaming of going to the university it was impressive how much they are aware not only of good business practices but also marketing prices organic methods and preserving the environment these women never had much chance at formal education and now are changing the future for their entire village

9058391 four months of turmoil have followed in which almost every move by palin has been questioned from firing the museum director to hiring a deputy administrator at a cost of 50 000 a year to a short lived proposal to move the citys historic buildings from downtown
9058392 mayor palin has stated on several occasions that the national rifle association encouraged her to fire chief stambaugh because of his stance against the concealed weapons legislation
9058393 john mccain is to be commended on his choice of sarah palin a true christian for vice president
9058394 palin an evangelical who is pro life and pro marriage meets all the criterion that cadc set forth for a vp pick unfortunately obama chose joe biden a liberal catholic who is not in compliance with christian moral teaching on abortion or homosexuality
9058395 between an avowed pro abortion ticket that would continue to push for unrestricted abortion on demand and a strongly pro life ticket that will bring us closer to a society that embraces the value and dignity of human life
9058396 will mccain pick a pro choice republican or perhaps a moderate mormon or a liberal jew i urge mccain to pick someone that conservative evangelicals and catholics can support
9058397 unless mccain picks a true christian for vice president real conservative christians are being disenfranchised from this presidential election obama missed a great chance to reach out to christians now we will see if mccain will let conservative christians have someone we can vote for not just vote against
9058398 we wondered how her using a city computer to run for lieutenant governor in 2002 was different than republic party chief randy ruedrich using alaska oil and gas conservation commission computers for party business for which he was fined and resigned under pressure she said it was different

9058400 apparently that is exactly the kind of vicious campaign the former two term wasilla mayor is running in our view that kind of backdoor character assassination is the most scurrilous type of attack
9058401 it is akin to running against teddy kennedy and promising not to discuss bridges cars swimming or chappaquiddick oh i have dirt palin says smugly yes indeedy but ill not give the details because that would be wrong she is right it is very wrong it is very much the hallmark of lightweight politicians in over their heads

9058439 france is definitely the good place to be when working around open source
9058440 the french social model was appropriate for innovators and entrepreneurs to start working on alternative solutions to proprietary software fostering the creation of new projects in which a good mix of experienced professionals and skilled computer science students work together

9058444 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
9058445 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
9058446 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
9058447 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
9058448 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base

9058452 this incident only affected a handful of customers and to our knowledge all customers emails are being restored
9058453 receiving or reading these widespread emails themselves does not mean you are infected but if users open the attachment they will be infecting their windows computer they will give hackers an open door to take control and steal information
9058454 theres no other way of putting it this attack is sick hackers have no qualms about exploiting a familys natural instinct to defend its most vulnerable members

9058656 ive never felt that france is a musical place in japan many people make music and often they are doing another job to survive but in paris it is the opposite there is some support from the french government so when a person decides to be an artist or musician they never do another job and they dont make music often either

9058670 they do throw the ball around a lot and we do need to improve

9058710 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9058711 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9058712 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9058713 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9058714 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty

9058747 yo creo en roe vs wade y llego a esa concusi n no porque estoy a favor del aborto si no porque a fin de cuentas no creo que las mujeres tomen esas decisiones a la ligera
9058748 tengo un historial de 25 a os como antiabortista en el congreso y en el senado
9058749 creo que la gente tiene una opci n muy clara
9058750 creo que obama hizo su mejor esfuerzo dado su punto de vista y el formato y creo que mccain fue de lo mejor que lo he visto hacer creo que disip algunas de las dudas de los conservadores sociales acerca de su compromiso con la causa a favor de la vida y c mo la entiende
9058751 creo que he hecho un claro contraste entre barack obama y yo si l puede seguir con ese fervor e integraci n de asuntos y fe creo que tendr un nuevo impulso en su campa a si se a sla en un lugar donde no quiere hablar m s sobre esas cosas creo que no le ayudar as que fue una tremenda victoria creo que se trata de un nuevo cap tulo espero que contin e

9058754 hist ricamente no hemos definido el matrimonio en nuestra constituci n
9058755 no puedes hacer que el c rculo se haga cuadrado como l intenta hacerlo
9058756 o apoyas el matrimonio o no lo apoyas l dice una cosa sus acciones indican otra y esa respuesta fue extremadamente d bil y nos muestra la hipocres a en su postura sobre este asunto creo que ser a m s refrescante para l si tan s lo fuera honesto acerca de ello y dice que est a favor del matrimonio gay no lo puede hacer porque el pueblo americano no favorece el matrimonio gay
9058757 yo apoyo firmemente preservar el estatus nico del matrimonio entre un hombre y una mujer
9058758 en mi estado espero que tomemos esa decisi n y otros estados ya la han tomado para reconocer el estatus nico entre un hombre y una mujer y eso no significa que la gente no puede lograr acuerdos legales eso no significa que no tienen los derechos de todos los ciudadanos lo que digo es que debemos preservar el estatus nico del matrimonio entre un hombre y una mujer
9058759 s i una corte federal decide que mi estado de arizona debe observar lo que decida el estado de massachusetts acerca del matrimonio de homosexuales entonces yo estar a a favor de una enmienda federal constitucional hasta entonces creo que los estados deben tomar decisiones dentro de sus propios estados
9058760 no creo que era un juez tan fuerte o un pensador legal en el momento de su nombramiento aparte del hecho de que estoy en gran desacuerdo con su interpretaci n de muchas partes de la constituci n
9058761 yo no nombrar a al juez scalia aunque creo que no hay dudas acerca de su brillantez intelectual porque l y yo no estamos de acuerdo
9058762 yo pienso que el presidente de los estados unidos tiene una incre ble responsabilidad al nombrar gente para la suprema corte de los ee uu
9058763 esta nominaci n debe basarse en el criterio de tener un registro comprobado de adherencia estricta a la constituci n de los estados unidos de am rica y no a la legislatura desde el banquillo algunos de los peores da os han sido causados por legislar desde el banquillo

9058773 my intention is to return to that more direct relationship with artists and audiences
9058774 these folks are always always always manipulating and thinking about their next move and the only way you can keep them off guard is to supervise them to the point where they have to worry about the next time theyre going to be checked
9058775 their thought process is different than the average person they have a single minded nature about the way they think about things
9058776 they have a need driven underlying fantasy to offend in a sexual way its almost like an addiction
9058777 you cant look at these people like you can save them i cant be any blunter than that
9058778 its not that they cant be controlled and its not like they cant function in society but thats going to have to be with a high level of supervision

9058838 i believe we can still be friends and stuff like that and have that relationship on the racetrack
9058839 i might text him later and well go get some in n out burger
9058840 no wait he doesnt eat that stuff probably i dont know maybe salads
9058841 doesnt matter were here to race and the racings been pretty good
9058842 all this stuff this week i kind of just got a chuckle out of it because i know deep down what he says doesnt matter to me and what i say doesnt really matter to him
9058843 what really matters is we race well on the race track i say well be fine
9058844 means you cant do anything like you did last week again nascar did what they thought was right
9058845 people always say that all im doing out there is running into people im telling you im not out there to try to move anybody
9058846 its going to make the race interesting going to make it good for the fans and im a fan and im going to enjoy watching what they do between each other
9058847 daher habe ich das gef hl dass das ganze niemals wirklich aufh rt
9058848 ja das ist es auf jeden fall aber muss es ein vielseitiges angebot an titeln geben schaut man sich an dass games in ihrer fr hzeit lediglich ein elektronisches spielzeug waren mit dem man sich erst einmal zurechtfinden musste und dass games erst im laufe der zeit einen kulturellen status erlangt haben dann ist dies etwas das wir auch heute noch vorfinden casual games sind einfach zum spielen da doch gr ere produktionen sind wie b cher oder filme aus denen man lernen kann die einen bewegen oder die einem die augen ffnen f r mich pers nlich ist es also sehr wichtig dass meine games eine aussage haben
9058849 selbstverst ndlich will ich bei jedem neuen game etwas neues schaffen aber ich bin nicht nur sch pfer sondern genauso auch gesch ftsmann daher kann ich nicht leugnen dass sich serien besser verkaufen als originelle einzelkreationen das sp re ich seit einigen jahren am eigenen leib es ist verdammt schwer etwas beispielloses zu etablieren

9058852 even with the system of permits even with the limits of movement to south africa we never had as much restriction on movement as i see for the people here
9058853 there are areas in which people would live their whole lifetime without visiting because its impossible
9058854 the issue of separate roads different registration of cars driven by different nationalities the indignity of producing a permit any time a soldier asks for it and of waiting in long queues in the boiling sun at checkpoints just to enter your own city i think is worse than what we experienced during apartheid
9058855 the daily indignity to which the palestinian population is subjected far outstrips the apartheid regime and the effectiveness with which the bureaucracy implements the repressive measures far exceed that of the apartheid regime
9058856 this is ridiculous why are they arresting our guides and leaving the man with the megaphone
9058857 these provocations didnt come from us im jewish and i look at this and i say to myself how can i feel fear from other jews
9058858 as you walk into yad vashem you see a quote that says in effect you should know a country not only by what it does but what it tolerates
9058859 so i found it very shocking to then come and here and see footage of teenagers heaping abuse on palestinian children as they come out of school and throwing stones at them and that this should be done in the name of judaism i find totally reprehensible
9058860 what the holocaust teaches us more than anything else is that we must never turn our heads away in the face of injustice

9058866 there is much evidence to warrant an in depth investigation of the role played by agents of israel in the 9 11 attacks
9058867 just what level of power do israeli interests wield in the halls of power in the us that any investigation into israeli spying activities on us soil against us intelligence agencies can be so completely quashed
9058868 they were trying to take a current situation and get some training out of it
9058869 500 pound gorilla in israel well armed and trained operates in both gaza and the west bank known to disregard international law to accomplish mission very unlikely to fire on american forces fratricide a concern especially in air space management

9058871 on the morning of 9 11 and just as the wtc towers were crumbling the five israelis were caught doing the happy dance as they videotaped the twin towers fall
9058872 either someone does something about these sick psychopaths or they and their kind in washington and around the world will destroy us all
9058873 since 2003 academic unions have been dominated by a campaign to exclude israelis and nobody else from uk campuses we have warned the ucu general secretary on numerous occasions that this campaign has imported anti semitic ways of thinking into our union she either didnt understand or didnt care that the union is now circulating racist material should be understood as a manifestation of its institutional anti semitism it cannot be written off as yet another random accident
9058874 the ucu is circulating links to david dukes website on behalf of delich
9058875 im not surprised that anti semitic material has again dropped into my inbox from the union activists list what is shocking is the failure of the unions internal procedures to do anything about this ucu prides itself on being an anti racist union in fact it is probably the most complacent public institution in britain in relation to increasing anti semitism and the leadership turns a blind eye or worse to the racism in the union behind all this is the campaign of discrimination against israeli academics which is fostered by some in the union and encouraged by the leadership
9058876 this is precisely the kind of thing which drove me recently to resign from the ucu it has become a union which is complacent about anti semitism it regards prejudicial hostility toward jews from within the union itself as something too unimportant for it to bother with i didnt feel able to remain in an institution which treats anti semitism indulgently as a special exception to a generally anti racist stance
9058877 anti semitism is routinely tolerated on the activist list when it is expressed in the language of hostility to israel
9058878 only a small group of jews and anti racists have been standing up against this culture on the list some have been excluded from the list on trumped up charges others have been driven off the list by continual accusations of bad faith some have left the union because they cannot bear to pay their dues to what they consider to be an anti semitic organization
9058879 criticism of israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti semitic

9058885 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten because weve been footing the bill when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price
9058886 it pains us to take this measure however we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users
9058887 a big part of the problem may be twitters choice of uk sms distributor
9058888 dont put off until tomorrow what you can do today
9058889 applies to business yet twitter has done exactly the opposite by putting off the development of a business model
9058890 we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service
9058891 it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users
9058892 twitter will continue to negotiate with mobile operators in europe asia china australia the americas and other regions to forge relationships that benefit all our users our goal is to provide full two way service with twitter via sms to every nation in a way that is sustainable from a cost perspective

9058903 this morning we removed widgetlaboratory a third party application developer from the ning platform for violating nings terms of service widgetlaboratory provided independently developed applications that could be added to a social network on the ning platform by a network creator while we try to be as transparent as possible its our long standing policy not to comment on specific cases where we remove networks or third party developers from the ning platform so we will not be providing any additional details publicly
9058904 as of this morning august 22 2008 we learned from our customers that ning had unilaterally removed widgetlaboratory com and all of its products we have received no formal notice or explanation at this time we have not violated any terms of service nor have we violated any published guidelines from ning
9058905 this action by ning was completely without any notice was without any merit and in our opinion was done for the sole purpose of eliminating a company that had started to provide a useful and valuable service to all of you we have a full and complete documentation of our relationship with ning from the very first moment that we contacted them in november of 2007 and met with them subsequently to get their blessing for creating our company and products the facts and details contained therein will substantiate our claims regarding nings actions
9058906 unfortunately this is a black and white issue of widgetlaboratory violating our terms of service after multiple warnings and negatively impacting the ning platform we had to act and did so the answer wont be to bring back widgetlaboratory our terms of service are there for a reason please know we did not enter into this decision lightly
9058907 and claims that in the past it had always worked successfully with ning to resolve any technical issues
9058908 third party developers and the early discussion of the possibility of terminating widgetlaboratorys accounts seem to indicate that ning was already anticipating a negative outcome something that is unhealthy in any
9058909 may have been collecting as much revenue as ning itself

9058952 at the moment we wouldnt accept liability for the fire we dont believe it should be on charged to us and a legal argument would have to be sorted out in court
9058953 my understanding of it is its the total cost of the fire suppression effort including fire engines i imagine they were of a significant cost and were destroyed but i imagine they have insurance
9058954 no invoice has been given to the waikato district council and until thats the case until the council respond to that we simply dont know i would have thought that the council would have had insurers to have claimed that on anyway
9058955 as to whether the fire service tries to recoup those costs its not for me to say as we havent had those costs

9058961 the horses found dead at the scene have been examined and post mortems on them were completed yesterday we are still awaiting the results of those examinations the bodies of three dogs were also found close to the horses
9058962 officers have completed a search of the outbuildings and are now in the process of removing vehicles from the site we have completed a cursory search of the annexe part of the main building which is relatively intact following the fire
9058963 there is extensive debris at the site and it will take some days possibly several weeks to complete this part of the investigation we will be seeking to build up a picture of the circumstances leading up to the fire
9058964 there is a lot of speculation concerning this incident and we are anxious to clarify the exact circumstances as soon as possible
9058965 however i stress this will be a lengthy process and we would ask for the support and cooperation of the local community while we continue to work at the scene
9058966 nearly 100 officers and support staff are continuing to work round the clock and more information will be released publicly as it becomes available
9058967 we are very concerned for the safety of kirstie and her family who are in our thoughts and prayers
9058968 the investigation is continuing and additional quarantines and testing are likely to occur
9058969 there has been no evidence of natural transmission of the organism by ticks tick surveillance is continuing in an effort to ensure that there are no infected ticks and no tick species likely to transmit the disease in florida
9058970 work is being carried out to identify additional horses or premises that may have been in contact with or associated with a positive horse or premises
9058971 in addition representatives of the southeastern cooperative wildlife diseases study are assisting with tick surveillance on affected premises
9058972 this is a fantastic way to get new people engaged in the sport and i am really pleased to be taking part weve seen this sort of approach in other sports and i think its going to be great for eventing
9058973 eventing is a lifelong passion of mine and one that i would like more people to experience and enjoy its an equestrian triathlon and arguably the ultimate test of the partnership between horse and rider but that can make it quite a challenging sport for the spectator to understand and follow
9058974 i believe that express eventing will encourage many more people to engage with the sport spectators will not only enjoy the very best of the worlds riders at close quarters but the stadium technology will ensure they know exactly whats going on and what each rider has to do to win
9058975 it will be a fast paced fun and dramatic day out for the whole family sport and entertainment at its very best
9058976 british eventing is delighted to support this new initiative within the sport it is an exciting new competition for our riders and a great opportunity to introduce the sport to a wider audience
9058977 whether or not he would have passed the test in the writers opinion is immaterial to this point the media made that choice for us and marginalized him even after he showed some viability in iowa didnt fox boot him from the debate which followed steve arney
9058978 paul you and your friends obviously dont understand that whats important isnt the speaker but what the tv experts say about the speaker by accident i was watching coverage on pbs when i noticed that they were showing the speaches i immediately turned to fox

9058993 and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9058994 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
9058995 as we discussed a bit at the development call were going to be moving the code freeze for beta 1 to september 30 this schedule adjustment will better allow us to incorporate feedback from the alpha on exciting features like worker threads before beta and adjusts for some of the impact of mu on build and release resources
9058996 alpha 2 builds will be produced using the code from aug 19 as before and we should have a schedule for the build availability and release pretty shortly likely around sept 2 if you made me guess dont make me guess

9059006 turning the results around there are some hints here about viable anti spam policies although classifying email addresses by the amount of non spam email received is not a very sensible way of deciding whether future messages will be spam or not it does seem clear that there is a significant gain in spam filtering efficiency to be gained from making the isp email reception systems aware of all valid email addresses

9059016 performance as absolute and measurable as it might seem also has a lot of subtlety there are many elements and many tradeoffs involved in achieving performance that meets everyones expectations we know that even meeting expectations folks will want even more out of their windows pcs and thats expected weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area in windows 7 and ie 8 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams fundamentals
9059017 how much memory a given scenario allocates during a run as you know there is a classic tradeoff in time v space in computer science and were not exempt we see this tradeoff quite a bit in caches where you can use more memory or disk space in order to improve performance or to avoid re computing something
9059018 disk i o while hard drives have improved substantially in performance we still must do everything we can do minimize the amount that windows itself does in terms of reading and writing to disk including paging of course
9059019 disk footprint while not directly related to runtime performance many folks see the footprint of the os as indicative of the perceived performance we have some specific goals around this metric and will dive into the details soon as well well also take some time to explain windowswinsxs as it is often the subject of much discussion on technet and msdn here rather than runtime tradeoffs we see convenience tradeoffs for things like on disk device drivers assistance content optional windows components as well as diagnostics and logging information

9059032 a complaint against dnr for a recently launched state website meant to clarify the issue for voters
9059033 it has become clear to us that the department of natural resources is working hand in hand with the industry and that the state is inappropriately making efforts to influence voters on this ballot initiative
9059034 imposing hefty penalty is not the only solution now we cannot raise it as it was recently slashed to 2 5 from 8 to converge spot and futures prices
9059035 apart from the penalty provision we are working on other alternatives to penalise defaulters

9059057 theres no hurry anymore when all is said and done
9059058 sarah putin sic is not a catholic as stated in previous release
9059059 i wish i could say that i knew something about her but i just dont
9059060 university of idaho alumni are sizable in number but remain a close knit community
9059061 a large number of university alumni such as sarah have gone on to distinguish themselves in public service
9059062 youve got an idaho girl there on the ticket shes fairly tough idaho women are fairly tough so shell be able to handle anything that biden or obama can throw at her
9059063 the nice thing from a policy perspective is that shes obviously knowledgable on western issues public land issues and other things that are of concern in the west
9059064 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9059065 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9059066 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9059067 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9059068 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9059069 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9059070 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9059071 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck

9059074 winning or losing a couple of percent on a coinflip because i made the trade on tuesday and the fed said something an hour after i placed the order
9059075 by singing in harmony from the same page of the same investing hymnal the diehards drown out market noise
9059076 theres lots of stuff we can learn by studying the past one thing we cant learn though is how much the future will resemble the past
9059077 i have a balanced portfolio made up entirely of 4 and 5 star funds
9059078 this seems illogical to me i would think that investors would be willing to pay more for a share that produces the higher yield and less for a share that produces a lower yield
9059079 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9059080 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9059081 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9059082 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9059083 i thought it was unfair to us and to him
9059084 its a very reasoned response from those jurors because they apparently recognized this was not something they were well suited to determine
9059085 in my view its going to cause the u s attorneys to give a second thought to prosecuting soldiers for acts that occurred in combat
9059086 how many jurors have been involved in a domestic dispute in which a person was killed none you dont put those people on a jury
9059087 i dont think any of us who passed that legislation thought we were now going to have people discharged from the military being charged in federal court
9059088 there are all kinds of problems with witnesses and evidence and those kinds of things in addition to the fact that military persons are operating in an environment quite different from the normal street crime we see
9059089 but its worth taking a closer look at whether civilian juries will ever have the confidence to believe they can sit in judgment in these cases
9059090 the average american is reluctant to second guess the conduct of a service person in a combat zone
9059091 theres no real light at the end of the tunnel for newspapers
9059092 its not clear where the revenues are going to bottom out
9059093 the cuts that theyve taken have not been able to compensate for the decline in revenue as the revenue picture becomes more bleak those cost actions have accelerated
9059094 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9059095 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9059096 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9059097 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9059098 hey you kids get off my lawn you damn ruffians
9059099 when you live in a capitalistic society the currency of the dissemination of information goes through capitalistic channels would noam chomsky object to his works being sold at barnes and noble no because thats where people buy their books were not interested in preaching to just the converted its great to play abandoned squats run by anarchists but its also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message people from granada hills to stuttgart
9059100 yo i have an extra ticket to the rage show tonight wanna go
9059101 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9059102 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9059103 i think it raises its profile i dont think it changes the steps you go through it is what it is you have to find out what happened
9059104 we want the documents now so that we can argue that the trial should not go ahead
9059105 were not going to discuss these allegations in a public forum
9059106 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9059107 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9059108 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9059109 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9059110 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9059111 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9059112 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9059113 from the point of view of polands interests we will be strategically more secure
9059114 i am the last person to seek conflict with our neighbors but as prime minister i must not leave poland defenseless
9059115 can you deny that having the shield base redzikowo will be target no 1 for countries that dont agree with it
9059116 i prefer to have here american troops rather than soviet troops
9059117 depends on you how well you are able to seize that opportunity
9059118 all of our principals sign an agreement with us saying if their school gets a d or an f two years in a row or three cs in a row we can remove them
9059119 we also reward those schools and those principals and teachers who get good results by giving them additional pay
9059120 ive shut down 70 schools brought in a new principal who selected a new team and they are operating in a more effective way
9059121 we had high schools that had a 30 per cent graduation rate i shut those schools down and replaced them with smaller high schools in the same building and some of those schools now have a 70 or 80 per cent graduation rate
9059122 im confident that we can resolve the issue of electricity policy and once we resolve that there will be complete unity again
9059123 the issue of generation is always the one that has attracted the most heat within the labor party
9059124 there are so many problems with this arrangement it should not go ahead
9059125 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9059126 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet
9059127 and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9059128 if you want change in washington if you hope for a better america were asking for your vote
9059129 john mccain has made his candidacy about a single argument experience and sarah palin doesnt have it
9059130 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
9059131 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9059132 what the people heard people of every creed and colour from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
9059133 being sustainable fundamentally is about striving to find better more efficient ways of doing things
9059134 the efforts were undertaking to become more sustainable will help provide a cleaner environment a stronger community and a more cost effective government

9059152 there is a long way to go to get up to that level in all honesty
9059153 this summer like last summer the jet stream has been a long way south much further south than we would normally expect it to be
9059154 it has been largely around the uk rather than between scotland and iceland where we would traditionally expect it to be

9059159 it has become a growing source of wealth and an increasingly worthwhile investment opportunity
9059160 markets for water and thus its export handled with transparency flexibility and solid regulation could improve substantially the way water is managed and used in quebec
9059161 this could create strong incentives for conserving water and would allow for the fair and efficient reallocation of available water to meet our needs

9059181 most people think corporate income taxes are paid by wealthy anonymous companies
9059182 but as economists have been teaching for years ultimately people bear the burden of corporate taxes not companies and in 2006 that burden averaged 3 190 per household thats more than the average household spends on restaurant food gasoline or home electricity in a year

9059190 its been nearly 20 years since bellingham had a rink and thats a shame
9059191 i think a rink would be a great success in bellingham
9059192 we really need one in a town our size skating is a perfect family activity
9059193 we havent had a rink in bellingham since the one at the old national guard armory closed in 1989
9059194 we used to have four rinks in the county and now the only one left is in lynden home of the lynden skating club
9059195 we see wonderful facilities like the sportsplex and the arne hanna aquatic center and we can only wish someone would come along to invest in a roller rink
9059196 it would be a multi functional complex since the national roller sports association sponsor of the nationals in nebraska oversees several roller sports
9059197 if i was a millionaire i would build a rink in a heartbeat
9059198 we have a lot of former national champions in our county
9059199 you have to remember to breathe yet stand straight and hold your gut in while remembering all the steps and set patterns in a routine and keep time to the music its a lot harder than it looks
9059200 im definitely excited to do it theres no travel involved
9059201 its really exciting very fastpaced its a fight to stay near the front were continually sprinting so it makes for a very very fast race
9059202 therell be some guys that might get some road rash
9059203 at the race at enumclaw had a great huge turnout probably about 500 people over the weekend
9059204 the category i was in had about 60 riders and they all want to stay in the front
9059205 in the higher categories you see a lot more team tactics
9059206 youll see a whole team get their guys in front so youve got to look at the guys with the same jersey the higher categories definitely have a lot more strategy
9059207 it made sense to me that wed train here together
9059208 this is going to be a very special day for running in bellingham
9059209 this is the first time weve had a celebration to end our one week summer camp for girls on the run and were planning to make it an annual event
9059210 well start at 9 a m at the barkley village gazebo and everyone in the area is invited to participate including boys and men
9059211 its a non competitive event and our goal is to celebrate the strength confidence and character in girls and women
9059212 in 2007 girls on the run offered half of our total participants either full or partial scholarships to girls who wouldnt otherwise be able to participate in our program
9059213 there are now more than 160 girls on the run councils across the united states and canada
9059214 the local girls on the run program was founded in 2001 by nancy tupper
9059215 we served 250 girls in whatcom county in the past year in fall spring and summer girls on the run
9059216 i really feel the sense of accomplishment our girls develop carries on in all aspects of their lives
9059217 they learn that inside beauty is more important than whats outside
9059218 one girls mother told me her daughter had never done a 5k before joining girls on the run and now she wants to try triathlons
9059219 we keep the groups small so each girl can receive a lot of individual attention
9059220 some groups meet to run and talk once a week and others meet twice in addition to running we talk about topics such as healthy nutrition and why bullying and gossiping are so harmful
9059221 but my mother told me about a car that was available from the mount vernon fire department and it seemed like it would be cool
9059222 i finished third in my first competition last september and then i won the next competition in may
9059223 thats how i qualified for the all american soap box derby
9059224 but i began to realize that it was a lot like ski racing youre reacting to the quick changes you need to make in a lane
9059225 and thats an important part of the race how you fold yourself into the car
9059226 as the day wore on and adam kept winning i was sitting back and grinning because about halfway through it all adam turned to me and said its ok dad ive got it
9059227 what he meant was that he understood the mechanics and decisions he had to make at that point i just relaxed because adam had it figured out
9059228 theres a lot of tension and everything goes so fast in a small period but its not really scary the trick is just to be as smooth as a you can be you actually have more control in skiing
9059229 mike bourgeois a local 1983 firefighter helped me with the car
9059230 it was originally driven by his daughter megan after it was built for the may 2007 qualifying race
9059231 were getting financial support for our trip from washington alder a timber company mount vernon parks and the mount vernon fire department
9059232 just the spectacle of it all and the thousands of people who will be watching will make it quite an experience
9059233 well learn a lot of the details of whats going on when were racing on saturday
9059234 thats what happens when youre helping to run the race
9059235 if people can run only one race during the year they look forward to the chuckanut
9059236 in those days there was only one century to consider

9059306 i can count on one hand the number of projects weve approved that have been anywhere near that density
9059307 we need sustainability we need workforce housing if this project falls into those categories i need to know how that is going to work
9059308 it seems a little hazy to me that this is called workforce housing when we dont have any concrete agreement between trammell crow and station to make it so
9059309 our goal is fairly simple and that goal is to provide housing that is more affordable than single family housing and to locate it close to where opportunities for work exist
9059310 it gives us enough traffic on our roads i dont think that the construction of apartments is consistent with the surrounding neighborhood
9059311 we all agreed that an apartment housing project is not the perfect project for this property but it is the best project thats been suggested
9059312 the people who live there will be shopping and spending in our community and that benefits everybody

9059318 ill just have a little cake with my children and well probably watch some cartoons
9059319 i am letting them enjoy their childhood as much as possible i let them go to the arcade and go to the movies and do things i think that comes naturally i want them to get to do things i didnt get to do

9059324 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is

9059326 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him

9059345 i just love so i dont understand when people cant do exactly what i do
9059346 his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame
9059347 i am not the reason that he has no contact with his daughter he is
9059348 in real danger and she needed to save her and get lindsay into a place
9059349 it just was a straight shot straight down the lane he hit the curb and flew through the window
9059350 there was blood everywhere and there were bodies all over the place
9059351 i went in to see if i could help there was nothing that could be done for anyone in the front of the store

9059355 the prime ministers legal actions are an attempt to use the courts to interfere with the official oppositions freedom of political expression and thereby give his party an advantage over his principal political opponents

9059362 the fundamental principle behind any selection of a running mate would be whether that person is fully prepared to take over and shares your values your principles your philosophy and your priorities
9059363 and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
9059364 she was scheduled for a high profile speaking role at our convention and included in the vp selection process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials

9059367 i think the environmental protection agency would be well advised to put an immediate emergency ban on the neonicotinoid seed treatment pesticides i would say on all pesticides
9059368 what became obvious as the evidence unfolded however is that from time to time despite denials to the contrary both mr brown and his son ashley barker were involved in acts of racial aggression towards members of mr khans family

9059370 at the end of the day it should have been murder not
9059371 if he did not have the intention to go out and murder he should not

9059428 with his selection of alaska governor sarah palin john mccain has demonstrated that this will indeed be a historic election governor palin has a proven record as a reformer who gets results and will feel at home within a mccain administration as a working mother of five and an experienced executive palin has a great story that will connect with working families virginians can feel confident that a mccain palin ticket will bring to the white house the experience and leadership necessary to address our nations most pressing problems
9059429 the wrap on her is going to be she has even less experience than barack obama does is she really experience enough

9059434 los instrumentos aztecas como los silbatos con forma de calavera poseen caracter sticas de construcci n que no se encuentran en ning n otro instrumento musical conocido
9059435 este sonido se produce a diferencia de los instrumentos tradicionales cuando dentro de las flautas se chocan dos corrientes de aire diametralmente opuestas dentro de lo que he llamado una c mara del caos
9059436 reproduc an el sonido que los antiguos pobladores de mesoam rica supon an en el inframundo
9059437 nuestro cerebro no puede procesar los dos sonidos al mismo tiempo
9059438 luego de un tiempo de estar expuesto a esos sonidos el cerebro deja de insistir en procesarlos y la persona que escuchaba deber a caer probablemente en una suerte de trance

9059440 nos sorprendi encontrar que antes de que una mosca vuele en respuesta a la amenaza de un depredador o un matamoscas sta planea la direcci n de su salto haciendo una serie de complejos movimientos
9059441 el objetivo de estos movimientos para planear la hu da dice el profesor dickinson logran posicionar cuidadosamente el cuerpo del insecto para que las patas queden situadas en la mejor posici n para escapar en direcci n opuesta de la inminente amenaza
9059442 estos movimientos son muy r pidos toman unos 200 milisegundos
9059443 esto ilustra la rapidez con la que el cerebro de la mosca puede procesar la informaci n sensorial y convertirla en una respuesta motora apropiada
9059444 esto quiere decir que la mosca debe integrar la informaci n visual de sus ojos con la informaci n mecanosensorial de sus piernas

9059467 i had known for the past three years that i certainly was not waiting to make my plans
9059468 what youll see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising it at all levels of government were clearly better prepared

9059535 online has not proven to be unaffected by economic conditions
9059536 they are making a lot of these cuts up front so they can be in a position to turn the organization around
9059537 theres certainly the risk that a number of newspaper companies could run out of time
9059538 before they make the transition online and theres no evidence that making such a transition is a certainty
9059539 it will pick up again if we dont diminish the product so much that they dont rebound

9059549 you need to do a good analysis about whether this is acceptable risk
9059550 one of the things the government is betting on is the fact that if theres a failure its not a safety issue
9059551 from time to time we are going to have a glitch but its a tradeoff

9059593 if mccain wins by a landslide of epic proportions which is quite possible now with the pick of palin the platform and principles of the democratic party are in grave danger we must prevent a huge shift of democrats to the repubs we must reach out to moderate and independents and keep our core base committed to dem principles
9059594 the aim of the ndp is to prevent the republicans from capitalizing on a mccain palin landslide by coopting our voting bloc howard and obama lost us so completely today we must prevent the republicans from picking us up

9059600 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9059601 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9059605 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9059606 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9059626 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9059627 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9059628 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9059629 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9059630 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9059631 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9059632 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9059633 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9059634 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9059635 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9059636 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

9059639 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9059640 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

9059643 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9059644 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9059645 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9059646 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9059647 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9059651 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9059652 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9059653 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9059654 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9059655 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9059656 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9059657 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9059658 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9059659 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9059660 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
9059661 id think the obama people would have learned by now not to belittle the experience of women

9059669 governor sarah palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president
9059670 she has brought republicans and democrats together within her administration and has seen approval ratings of over 80 percent whether it is her resolve and toughness to challenge the influence of the big oil companies while fighting for the development of new energy resources or challenging a corrupt system and passing a landmark ethics reform bill sarah palin doesnt just talk about it she gets things done
9059671 as the head of alaskas national guard and mother of a soldier she understands the importance of supporting our brave men and women in uniform she has been shaking up government in alaska and making the tough decisions that come with being a leader i look forward to giving everything ive got to help the mccain palin team win in wisconsin so they can bring the right kind of change to washington
9059672 sarah palin is perfectly in step with john mccain on pushing big oils agenda and continuing george bushs failed economic policies
9059673 more disturbingly his political hail mary threatens to put a first term governor who just two years ago was mayor of a town of 8 000 a heartbeat away from being commander in chief

9059734 se ha tomado la decisi n definitiva en el ministerio hemos recibido la orden y romperemos las relaciones con la federaci n de rusia
9059735 georgia ya no tendr en rusia ni rusia en georgia la anterior gran representaci n que se hac a cargo de la labor pol tica
9059736 esta decisi n no significa que se suspenden definitivamente los contactos entre los ministerios de asuntos exteriores de ambos estados pues tales contactos ser n posibles en territorio de terceros pa ses
9059737 conservamos el consulado pues seg n la convenci n de viena la ruptura de las relaciones diplom ticas no significa la ruptura autom tica de las relaciones consulares
9059738 ambos estados estar n representados a nivel de c nsul vicec nsul y personal t cnico
9059739 lamenta la decisi n de georgia de suspender las relaciones diplom ticas aunque precis que no se hab a recibido a n ning n aviso oficial de tiflis
9059740 el cambio ocurre porque el pueblo estadounidense lo exige porque se alza e insiste en nuevas ideas y nuevo liderazgo una pol tica nueva para un tiempo nuevo
9059741 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9059742 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9059743 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9059744 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9059745 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9059746 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9059747 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9059748 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9059749 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9059750 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9059751 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9059752 who are open to doing something on the production side
9059753 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9059754 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9059755 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9059756 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9059757 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9059758 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9059759 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9059760 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9059761 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9059762 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9059763 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9059764 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9059765 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9059766 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9059767 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9059768 despu s de esto derramar mi esp ritu sobre todo ser humano y profetizar n vuestros hijos y vuestras hijas vuestros ancianos so ar n sue os y vuestros j venes ver n visiones
9059769 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9059770 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9059771 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9059772 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9059773 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9059774 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9059775 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9059776 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9059777 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9059778 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9059779 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9059780 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9059781 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9059782 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9059783 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9059784 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9059785 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9059786 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9059787 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9059788 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9059789 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9059790 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9059791 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9059792 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9059793 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9059794 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9059795 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9059796 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9059797 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9059798 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9059799 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

9059808 the rioters destroyed my house all of our family fled trying to save our lives ive got a 13 year old son and a husband who arent here in the camp and im worried about their fates
9059809 my house was burnt ive lost everything i was lucky to escape unhurt
9059810 a strict curfew is in force please stay indoors and dont come out for congregational prayers
9059811 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9059812 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9059813 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9059814 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9059815 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9059816 shes outside the box outside the traditional government standard fare
9059817 i think shell be an important factor in the race shell be great to solidify our base and appeal to independents
9059818 she knows how much a gallon of milk is and how expensive it is to fill up a gas tank
9059819 shes a fascinating person with a fascinating life story and she will bring energy to the ticket
9059820 unfortunately this choice reinforces john mccains embrace of the failed bush economic policies that have squeezed michigan for the last eight years on the issues that matter from outsourcing to choice the mccain palin agenda is wrong for michigan and unlike joe biden governor palin does not have the experience to step in and serve as our commander and chief women and men across michigan are ready for change and all john mccain has offered with his pick is more of the same
9059821 as a female public servant i have always tried to stay away from gender politics because of my desire to focus on getting the job done for the people but i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice senator mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society if the american people are truly seeking change and reform their only choice in this race is the mccain palin ticket
9059822 sen mccains choice for a running mate should surprise no one what were seeing is a maverick who has shaken up washington picking as his teammate a maverick governor who has shaken up her own state for those of us looking for real change this is a dream team
9059823 unlike the democrats false stereotypes of our party gov palin is a republican parent of young children who daily experiences the joys and challenges american families gov palin is modern american mom pursuing her familys happiness she lives it she gets it and she will be an historic and effective vice president of the united states
9059824 sen mccains selection of sarah palin for his vice presidential running mate opens up the whole presidential campaign it is a breath of fresh air and an opportunity for republicans to create real change this comes at the 88th anniversary of womens right to vote it is a smart and bold move on the part of sen mccain and shows his clear understanding of todays voters the palin pick has put new energy into the campaign and puts the voice of women on the center stage of american politics
9059825 governor sarah palin is a true reformer with a proven record of standing up to the status quo eliminating wasteful government spending and fighting for energy independence the strength principled leadership and compassion of john mccain and sarah palin will lead america well through the challenging times ahead
9059826 esta necesidad nos muestra que tendr amos no m s que ampliar el tiempo para recibir a las instituciones que faltan ser escuchadas un elemento central de todo este proceso es que con esto se expresa que la sociedad necesita todav a discutir en sus diferentes instancias este tema de la nueva ley de pensiones

9059839 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9059840 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9059841 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9059842 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9059843 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9059844 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9059845 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9059846 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9059847 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9059848 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9059849 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9059850 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9059851 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9059852 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9059853 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9059854 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9059855 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9059856 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9059857 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9059858 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9059859 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9059860 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9059861 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9059862 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9059863 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9059864 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9059865 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9059866 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9059867 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9059868 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9059869 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9059870 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9059871 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9059872 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9059873 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9059874 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9059875 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9059876 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9059877 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9059878 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9059879 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9059880 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9059881 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9059882 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9059883 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9059884 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9059885 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9059886 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9059887 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9059888 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9059889 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9059890 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9059891 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9059892 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9059893 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9059894 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9059895 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9059896 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9059897 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9059898 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9059899 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9059900 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9059901 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9059902 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9059903 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9059904 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9059905 this seems to be the work of the gulf cartel
9059906 we will have to see where the heads turn up i am sure they will try something spectacular to shock society
9059907 there is some kind of engagement to have some understanding of where we are because its not clear whether the talks have collapsed or are still on
9059908 the mediator has to help us appreciate where we are in terms of locating a way forward
9059909 we are trying with mbeki to get zanu pf to be flexible because there has not been any indication of movement of flexibility on the part of zanu pf
9059910 just with the south african mediators there is no zanu pf
9059911 we hope the talks can lead to the finalisation of the political and outstanding matters so that we can start with a normalisation of the political economic and humanitarian situation in zimbabwe
9059912 unless there is a political solution we dont have the necessary framework to deal with the economic recovery package for zimbabwe and the humanitarian crisis
9059913 it will be determined by the progress made they will continue until all parties feel they have covered sufficient ground
9059914 he was an ordinary business salesman running a company and a family man he was just an ordinary everyday chap well dressed a good businessman
9059915 we are devastated this just does not happen to your own family it is like something you see on television
9059916 there is no one who disliked her everyone got along with her she had no enemies
9059917 he is not in the intensive care unit he is in a reserved room
9059918 whenever news like this comes out all tibetans inside and outside tibet remain concerned it is a matter of concern for the future of tibet
9059919 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9059920 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9059921 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9059922 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9059923 no one works for someone we all just work together
9059924 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9059925 tu est s comigo a tua vara e o teu cajado me consolam
9059926 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9059927 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9059928 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9059929 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9059930 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9059931 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9059932 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9059933 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9059934 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9059935 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9059936 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9059937 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9059938 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9059939 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9059940 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9059941 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9059942 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9059943 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9059944 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9059945 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9059946 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9059947 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9059948 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9059949 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9059950 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9059951 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9059952 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9059953 mil cair o ao seu lado e dez mil a sua direita mas vc n o ser atingida 09 de outubro de 2006
9059954 we have roughly 10 of our volunteers in gaza and we have to get them
9059955 we need to get the passengers together hopefully within a month
9059956 this might be the beginning of a simple delivery service if we can set up the mechanisms here in cyprus this can be used as a model for what can be made more permanent
9059957 border between the state of lebanon and the state of hezbollah
9059958 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9059959 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9059960 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9059961 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9059962 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9059963 the prediction from our geotechnical experts is that within the next four days we are likely to see a very significant slip event which could sweep across the road and on to the foreshore
9059964 if youre taking low dose aspirin avoid ibuprofen which can cancel out the aspirins antiplatelet effect and cause a catastrophic stroke
9059965 a new study at the university at buffalo and the dent neurologic institute in buffalo is the first to show the stroke danger
9059966 it was the first time he really took mccain head on
9059967 obamas speech had a shorter shelf life than fred thompsons candidacy
9059968 the only thing that could have taken that speech off the front pages for the next 48 hours was a totally unpredictable pick john mccain gave them a totally unpredictable pick and now that speech is already old news
9059969 we could not be more pleased that 38 million people watched last night
9059970 then this morning they leaked it in dribs and drabs about who it wasnt going to be
9059971 it truly was genius it was a double leak strategy that really took a lot of the energy out of obamas speech and then to kick it off they went with gov palin which just blew it out of the water you have to hand it to the mccain people they played this brilliantly
9059972 in fact mccains choice may have even made obama look better by comparison
9059973 his event was monumental in scope and significance while mccains announcement seemed small by comparison more like a spring shower than thunder
9059974 the mccain camp basically let the obama news cycle play out hardly an ambush technique
9059975 his pick is being panned almost universally so if he tried to steal the spotlight what he was able to grab was a negative one
9059976 and while i dont speak for the obama campaign i would bet theyd be happy to allow sen mccain to have this type of negative press any day he wants
9059977 it really is at the intersection of marketing and commerce and entertainment
9059978 it was an exciting entrepreneurial opportunity within the publicis family for me to make this move
9059979 ultimately its really going to be a blend of more traditional brands that have targeted generation y and more fashion forward and niche brands
9059980 some of the big budget marketers will certainly have product offerings that are more middle market and more middle america but the brands that we work with them on will be more cutting edge trend setting
9059981 ive had a lot of success in getting the conversations going and getting in front of non publicis agencies because im able to position honeyshed as something unique in the marketplace
9059982 its not like every holding company has a honeyshed theres only one honeyshed on the web
9059983 were not asking people to buy houses and make major investments decisions in that way the broader stresses of the economy work in our favor
9059984 i am infuriated by these empty cans disillusioned by the abuse the flagrant insensitivity to the beauty of the land
9059985 why do they do it why do they carry their beer cans to this lovely isolated beach when they could just as easily sit on a city curb or beside a garbage dump i believe it is because they ave no choice they are drawn to the beauty of this place this is where they have to be
9059986 but when their party is over its as if some imp of the perverse takes over as if they have to prove to others that they are immune to the force of nature that lured them here to behave otherwise would be a tacit admission that they feel a connection to the land an attachment to the sea and sand a bond with what they perceive as sacred in the world
9059987 el cambio inicia a partir del pr ximo 28 de septiembre cuando todos los ecuatorianos digamos s al refer ndum aprobatorio de la nueva constituci n
9059988 estamos sellando la segunda y definitiva independencia de nuestros pa ses
9059989 por su triunfo en el reciente referendo revocatorio qu gran paliza le dio evo a los de siempre
9059990 supuestos l deres estudiantiles de venezuela est n asesorando a j venes de ecuador de nuestra oligarqu a pero no se preocupen juntos los derrotaremos
9059991 son peores que los yanquis el yanqui es un yanqui orgulloso de serlo pero el pitiyanqui es un arrastrado que lame la mano y otras cosas del yanqui
9059992 las lluvias afectaron mil hect reas de avena forrajera ma z y frijol en el sur de ojuelos y la parte cultivable de lagos de moreno
9059993 hay que esperar a que el agua disminuya para ver cu ntas sufrieron p rdida total y cu les tendr n que entrar en la cobertura del seguro catastr fico que los gobiernos estatal y federal tienen para estas contingencias
9059994 las semilleras tambi n entraron con un porcentaje para crear una bolsa conjunta y cubrir alrededor de 160 mil hect reas en el estado
9059995 sabemos en qu superficie pero s hay afectaciones con p rdida total
9059996 at the moment we wouldnt accept liability for the fire we dont believe it should be on charged to us and a legal argument would have to be sorted out in court
9059997 my understanding of it is its the total cost of the fire suppression effort including fire engines i imagine they were of a significant cost and were destroyed but i imagine they have insurance
9059998 no invoice has been given to the waikato district council and until thats the case until the council respond to that we simply dont know i would have thought that the council would have had insurers to have claimed that on anyway
9059999 as to whether the fire service tries to recoup those costs its not for me to say as we havent had those costs
