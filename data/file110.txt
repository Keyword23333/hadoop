1100000 well need to be lowered in the bottom if there is one is not close and if i read the bounces correctly any plumbline would likely get fouled in the convolutions
1100001 weve got about thirty meters of play on the cable and extension give or take plus our rope slack gerard youll carry the radio repeater
1100002 what do you think were going to find you know at the bottom
1100003 here we are at thirty nine meters it looks like this is the end of the road eh
1100004 the flesh and organs have been stripped note the marks of tooth and claw
1100005 but it does lead one to wonder since when do spirits eat
1100006 your prejudices wont gain you a thing down here ger were in the unremembered realm now where the ghost world touches our own okay what you think you know is useless but i can feel my guardian with me now and he will work for us both
1100007 shit we shouldve been the other kind of indians their gods come in numbers you know serious numbers not one freaking raccoon thats weak
1100008 no disrespect et but if a dozen rabid mink try to take us down i really cant see this invisible raccoon of yours as anything but a freaking appetizer
1100009 you say no disrespect but you have no idea what it means close your mouth try to learn something
1100010 i wouldve thought it would go north everything about this whole mess seems to point north why not this
1100011 our spirits not only eat but they defecate as well
1100012 detective im starting to think we might as well turn back okay how long can we go on doing this
1100013 its the only way for a family farm to stay competitive its the only way to get the yields we need to turn a profit
1100014 herbicide resistance is spliced into the dna along with counter measures against predator insects they sell it as a package solution seeds and spray
1100015 whether by design or opportunity something has found a novel way to exploit the unique makeup of your modified canola this compound in the pool its production is being catalyzed farmed from under your own farm
1100016 i dont think it is something unto itself though but rather an ingredient
1100017 we had to give it up though lost all our hives to colony collapse disorder
1100018 some people say ccd is connected to genetically modified crops
1100019 they eat meat weve seen their scat these moos bas may be ingesting the goo but they are not living from it observe the sacs between the shoulders they are filling with some kind of gas a chemical reaction is occurring the goo is being transformed
1100020 my limbs are artificial no skin has not been punctured
1100021 i feel like im losing my mind can this be real detective
1100022 i have seen many strange things monsieur corbeau but they were fleeting events seldom more than halfway in this world this on the other hand is concrete this is tangible and real and very very old this is not an intersection of the ghost world and ours this is something altogether different
1100023 we cant let a mississauga do this alone its an abenaki problem so abenaki must face it
1100024 because the moos bas know the way across look at the prints in the mud theyve tested every ford
1100025 not now not while active my theories are spun out from dreaming
1100026 detective mississauga is aware of his dreams ger he says it helps him
1100027 the answers do not come to me i come to them the dreams you remember do you know what they are
1100028 i do dreams are a sorting mechanism a method for classifying and amalgamating data in preparation for encoding to long term memory the engine you use to form higher thoughts is taken offline and repurposed when you sleep it is used to identify patterns it separates the wheat from the chaff trims redundancy makes semantic connections that allow for higher fidelity compression
1100029 normally awareness is partly or wholly subverted by this process in my case however i remain conscious throughout i am capable of directing the synthesis engine and tuning it toward a wilful end
1100030 i make connections yes a thousandfold more connections than would be possible for a waking mind i am able to ply the solution space in a completely fluid manner culling for arrangements of special significance
1100031 you must get a break when youre in the quiet place between dreams right what do they call it slow wave sleep
1100032 slow wave sleep is only dreamless for you not so for me it offers me no rest it is a trial to be endured
1100033 the brain never stops to stop would be to die but in slow wave sleep all things being equal the personality is disconnected the slow wave visions are not for you they are for your body your reflexes are primed your muscles memorize you are trained
1100034 for horror the slow wave visions are martial exercises explorations of worst case scenarios they are limbic and lurid all the worst things that can happen to a man are simulated in slow wave sleep to sharpen our responses to danger and crisis a programme of methodical nightmares the merest fractions of which ever bleed into regular dream
1100035 shit detective no wonder youre not afraid of nothing no matter what comes at you youve seen worse
1100036 but im not sure what happens in the aftermath of thousands of mutated minks converging on the core of a major metropolis
1100037 thats whats at stake okay then we should be moving
1100038 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now
1100039 the soldiers mere presence is a deterrent to criminals the fact that the soldiers are deployed in the street does not increase a sense of fear but scares those who intend to commit crimes
1100040 we sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude
1100041 we need a much bolder and much bigger set of solutions we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away

1100051 we zijn hier op de kws opgegroeid en nu varen we weer samen twee jaar geleden deden we ook mee aan de sneekweek en toen werden we tweede dat willen we dit jaar natuurlijk verbeteren
1100052 het duurde even voor het echt tot me doordrong ik had het in eerste instantie te druk met skutsjesilen maar op een dag zat ik in de sportschool en toen drong het ineens tot me door ik zit er niet bij dat was echt even een klap
1100053 ik had het helemaal niet verwacht maar ik vind het ontzettend leuk dat de gemeente sneek aan ons heeft gedacht
1100054 zo kijk ik er niet tegenaan ik heb heel veel geleerd de afgelopen drie jaar ik had geen topsportervaring toen ik met die andere meiden in de yngling stapte na drie jaar kan ik zeggen dat ik heel veel heb gezien van portugal tot aan miami en dat ik sportief en persoonlijk enorm ben gegroeid je leert zo veel een gezond leven je koppie erbij houden balans proberen te vinden het ynglingproject was af en toe heel moeilijk maar je leert ook met die zware omstandigheden om te gaan
1100055 ik wil best door met zeilen op topniveau maar de yngling doet in 2012 niet meer mee aan de olympische spelen misschien stap ik wel in een 470 of ik ga iets heel anders doen het schoolzeilproject van de gemeente sneek vind ik heel interessant en dat is met mijn pedagogische achtergrond ook een logische stap de toekomst zal het leren
1100056 read a property and a whole bunch of other stuff gets reset
1100057 when should i let someone do a thing their own way and when should i make them do it my way
1100058 sure the ethno sectarian violence is down baghdad has been ethnically cleansed for the most part and weve separated the rest by walls
1100059 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
1100060 zoopy have broken all offsite videos used by members of their site
1100061 we expected to find the emerald ash borer in wisconsin sooner or later but this is still disappointing
1100062 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1100063 a very cute little girl grabbed my leg and asked where are my parents where are my brothers
1100064 i saw her parents and brothers were on a plane that was set to take off in three minutes
1100065 i ran quickly because i knew that every minute mattered at the same time the police tried to contact the flight attendants to get them to stop the plane when i reached the gate the plane was no longer there
1100066 were in shock theyre very responsible and organized top notch people apparently one relied on the other and this is what happened
1100067 no similar weapon in the service of armies in the world
1100068 tax reform is desperately needed in the united states but before we can reform the tax code we must sharply reduce the tax burden on americans made necessary
1100069 the american people simply cannot afford more of the same which means more government spending more special interest pay offs more fraud and waste and continuing to treat american taxpayers like geese to be plucked rather than citizens of a free society and democratic republic
1100070 the individuals right to keep and bear arms helps ensure all of our freedoms the supreme courts recognition of the constitutional right to gun ownership is a recognition of the right to life liberty and property for all americans
1100071 we must address the issue of climate change but do so realistically recognizing the importance of simultaneously expanding energy supplies and maintaining economic growth our greatest strength in confronting the problems of the future is our free market economy only by reducing government barriers to private research and development are we going to achieve the innovative even transformational changes necessary in the years and decades ahead
1100072 america should not be the worlds policeman the american purpose is to provide a strong national defense not to engage in nation building or to launch foreign crusades no matter how seemingly well intentioned
1100073 neither the republicans nor the democrats can be trusted to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the american people as president i would never forget that it is a free society which we must defend we must never sacrifice the individual freedoms that make america so unique
1100074 its telling that daisuke matsuzaka who owns a sterling 11 1 record the best of any pitcher with at least 15 starts would probably be the 3 starter if the playoffs began today this rotation continues to improve and jon lester has emerged as the co ace of a three headed monster of red sox starters
1100075 yet on this team even with that record can we all agree that daisuke matsuzaka is a no 3 pitcher its not a putdown so much as a realization that josh beckett remains the staff ace and that lefty jon lester has emerged as a solid no 2
1100076 the red sox dont deserve a player like me during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players they did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro mart nez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
1100077 its common sense you can eat what you want just not enormous amounts
1100078 blaming our food instead of the real problem that we eat too much of it
1100079 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1100080 oh you dont know the half of it let me tell you what they said behind your back
1100081 my fellow americans i told you so did i not tell you did you listen noooo fine have fun see you in 2012 good night
1100082 maximizers want the best the problem that needs to be solved is whats the best jeans the best restaurant the best place to go on vacation the best marital partner everything yet that requires a search of all possibilities which is impossible
1100083 satisficers arent looking for the best theyre looking for good enough
1100084 search engine marketing networking and offline strategies for driving traffic
1100085 there is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision
1100086 if any man lacks wisdom let him ask of god who giveth to all men liberally

1100091 we believe were best positioned to be the consolidator in this industry when an industry reaches a point of maturation and growth stops it simply makes good economic sense to consolidate into one cost platform
1100092 we fundamentally believe that phone calls are the currency that local businesses operate under
1100093 i think we did the best that we could and i think we are happy just to get the issue before the public

1100101 information is a vital corporate asset but when mismanaged it can quickly become a liability and create risk

1100110 there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too
1100111 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
1100112 but take a look at the web site of the lead attorney representing apple
1100113 they came to us i think because this is a much bigger issue than just copyright
1100114 theres the fact that we are in the jurisdiction of the u s district court for northern california but weve also tangled with apple before weve dealt with apple so were familiar with the courts and the parties
1100115 what psystar might say is what we would like to do is use the mac operating systems unique features more broadly on a variety of hardware
1100116 i think its a very very hard argument to make but i wouldnt be surprised if they tried
1100117 my guess is that they will mount some kind of direct attack on apples exclusive licensing
1100118 the scale and size of this embassy set on 10 acres in a new diplomatic zone symbolizes the future of the relationship as it expands in scope and breadth
1100119 beyond the final score the politics of sport in asia
1100120 it acknowledges that chinas rise is not a zero sum game thats not denying the competitive aspects to the relationship but it is a broader template which coincides with the building of the new embassy
1100121 the completion of the two new embassies not only reflects the good shape of our relationship but also signals broad prospects for its further growth
1100122 a decade ago the bilateral issues were relatively well known taiwan human rights trade now chinas interests literally span the globe

1100128 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing

1100134 danske valg er for danske statsborgere man skal tage udgangspunkt i hvilken nationalitet man har og ikke hvor man betaler skat n r udlandsdanskerne udfylder deres valgrolle bevarer de tilknytningen til danmark og har en holdning til tingene det er meget vigtigt det er folkestyret
1100135 i takt med at vi lever i en internationaliseret verden hvor danskerne f r flere og flere aktiviteter i udlandet vil vi v re klar til at se n rmere p mulighederne og begr nsningerne for at udvide stemmeretten men gr nsen skal vurderes
1100136 vi vil st tte enhver forbedring for danske statsborgere bosat i udlandet s l nge det er i overensstemmelse med grundloven
1100137 hvis vi kommer fra et demokratisk land bakker op om demokratiet og hylder globaliseringen s g r det ikke at fratage folk deres ret til at stemme kort tid efter at de har forladt danmark
1100138 vi er bne for en generel tidsramme p 10 12 r det er bedre end ingenting
1100139 om man bor i riget er et tolkningssp rgsm l vi lever i en globaliseret verden hvor folk der er udstationeret kan stemme mens andre ikke kan det er forskelsbehandling og diskriminerende

1100141 stturkistan terrorgrupper repr senterer den st rste trussel mod legene
1100142 siden begyndelsen af ret har sikkerhedsorganerne i xinjiang stoppet terrorplaner og der var kun tre til fire s danne sager vi kan se at disse terrorgrupper ikke er i stand til at iv rks tte massive sabotageaktiviteter som nogle fjendtlige kr fter ellers havde h bet at se

1100144 disse gopler n r kysterne er en besked havet sender os med udsagnet se hvor d rligt i behandler mig
1100145 gopler er en glimrende alarmklokke for milj et jo flere gopler desto st rkere signal om at noget forandrer sig
1100146 der var mere end 20 mio gopler i en lagune lige for n sen af ferieboligerne
1100147 for det f rste er gopler rovdyr af betydning over for dyreplanktonet der omfatter de unge fiskelarver fra kommercielt vigtige fiskebestande hvis gopler der mere kan det s ledes f re til mindre rekruttering til nords fiskeriet resulterende i mindre bestande at fiske p
1100148 hvis f rst fiskebestanden er fisket ned skal der meget til at f den op at st igen n r goplerne ligger der i overfladelagene og spiser de f g og larver der er tilbage i den situation kan goplerne ret let f overtaget
1100149 det er en ret alarmerende udvikling som m f lges n je fordi betydelige skadeeffekter p fiskeriet ikke kan udelukkes i de sidste 20 r er temperaturen steget st t i nords en og ikke mindst de seneste rs varmerekorder har givet den invasive ribbegople s rligt gode betingelser for ikke blot at overleve men ogs formere sig og stige i antal r for r
1100150 vi har frygtet at denne sommer ville give en megabestand af dr bergopler i danske farvande og at det s ledes ville g helt galt lige f r jul blev der f eks i isefjorden registreret milliarder af goplernes bittesm overvintringsstadier men i sommer har der ingen dr bergopler v ret i isefjorden vinteren har m ske v ret for kold for dem men det fort ller bare at det er helt umuligt at forudse hvad der vil ske og hvorn r
1100151 der bliver ikke i dag foretaget nogen systematisk overv gning af goplerne fordi disse arter ikke indg r i nogle af de nationale moniteringsprogrammer og det er en stor fejl
1100152 bed mt ud fra meldinger fra fiskerne er det vores fornemmelse at vand og brandm nd i de senere r har optr dt i store m ngder end normalt fiskere klager over at de st r og alene hiver vandm nd og brandm nd ud af deres garn men det er ikke noget der ligger egentlige unders gelser af

1100173 canadas trade minister michael fortier said he hoped that any new deal would protect its dairy and poultry farmers from foreign competition
1100174 there are still potential potholes in the road but we are closer to a deal than we have been at any point in the last seven years
1100175 what is emerging is a deal that is not perfect not beautiful but is good for the global economy and good for development
1100176 theres no use beating around the bush this meeting has collapsed
1100177 in the face of the global food price crisis it is ironic that the debate came down to how much and how fast could nations raise their barriers to imports of food

1100181 the centre has made rs 10 as rti application fee but some states charge higher rates for instance haryana charges rs 50
1100182 has become more of a grievance cell for ips ias and wbcs officers
1100183 there is an acute shortage of staff and infrastructure but applications keep pouring in
1100184 things have improved though after pios were posted in each government department
1100185 the government should also create infrastructure like more buildings and provisions to send complaints directly from rural areas through e mail
1100186 government should come out with a special postal stamp of rs 10 towards payment of rti fee nationwide the amount collected through the stamp and information cost can be used to create awareness programmes
1100187 for instance in maharashtra the state information commissioners are also posted in nagpur and pune but in uttar pradesh all 10 information commissioners are in lucknow
1100188 if the fiscal policy response remained inadequate amidst heightened external shocks then ratings pressure for a change in indias sovereign ratings outlook from stable to negative would increase

1100192 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey

1100222 health education programs designed to promote physical activity should target not only children from socially disadvantaged households and neighborhoods but also children in immigrant families

1100230 i respect that theyre here and spent a lot on their homes but on the other hand give me a little bit too ive been here since i was 7 years old

1100240 there was a moment when the public opinion of the greatest empire in the world involved in the largest war in their history was changed by a few poets
1100241 and solzhenitsyn changed the story of the story of the soviet union he changed it from this difficult march to utopia to the decline of a brutal totalitarian state and his version of the soviet union lived longer than the official account that is a kind of social and cultural power that is special to writers

1100249 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes youll get punished for them
1100250 no one wants to go to jail but like i said youve got to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1100251 it should be over with after the second 30 days all of this comes from the juvenile thing

1100255 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1100256 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1100257 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1100258 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1100259 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1100260 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1100261 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1100262 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware
1100263 so we thought wed have people who want to celebrate with a gift do that with these two institutions
1100264 the very fact that we can get married to some people is a political act
1100265 they filled her prescription with the wrong strength and they never diagnosed the meningitis even though she had been complaining about headaches sweats and generalized pain for weeks that is what killed her in the end
1100266 it was so advanced that it involved her brain her liver her lungs her heart and a couple of other organs she died in terrible pain
1100267 i told them i needed my medicine but they didnt give me anything
1100268 she told me after a month in detention that she still hadnt seen a doctor
1100269 i told her i could send her more medicine but she said they would not give it to her they were mostly giving her tylenol
1100270 he told me that victoria wasnt eating and was urinating blood but that the officials still were not paying her any mind
1100271 he told me get outside help but try not to worry
1100272 her foot was chained to the bed and when she tried to turn over it would hurt her
1100273 that made it twice as hard it was so humiliating no human should have to live their last days like that
1100274 theyre cited as proof that racism is no longer a significant barrier to black advancement and interracial equality
1100275 this isnt new go to the 19th century and southern aristocrats would point to a certain african american landowner who was doing well to prove that whites are not racist
1100276 however the suggestion that somehow senator obamas campaign represents an easy shortcut is not realistic
1100277 senator obama believes that we still have a lot of work to do and thats not just true for the issues facing blacks or latinos but for women and other communities struggling to secure the basic necessities in life like jobs housing health care and quality education
1100278 first of all its beautiful its the kind of place i want to come and spend my time at to see membership grow and to see the atmosphere and the spirit is exactly what we had in mind when we started

1100299 this is an incredible story the first african american nominee going abroad after a long period of anti americanism
1100300 what that means of course is that the cbs evening news nbc nightly news and abcs world news will be broadcast from europe and the middle east this week throwing an even brighter spotlight on baracks obamas excellent adventure
1100301 sen obama has said this is going to be a listening tour we certainly hope very sincerely he listens to the advice of our military commanders
1100302 the question is whether he will listen to them or will he ignore there military judgment on the importance on having a conditions based withdrawal and supplant it with his own military assessment which is really based on a political calculation rather than any experience he has

1100312 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1100313 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1100314 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1100315 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1100316 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1100317 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1100318 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1100319 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1100320 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1100321 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1100322 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1100323 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1100324 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1100325 scratch the surface of any cynic and youll find a disappointed idealist

1100333 first to increase the number of people using drupal by a factor of at least 10 if not more in the next several years second to invest focused attention on the software to make sure it fulfills its potential third to build a company that respects the community the drupal way of doing things and that at the same time can be a big commercial success and finally to build products and services that lots and lots of drupal users will want in order to build a successful company we can only continue to do more and more for drupal if were making money if we build stuff you want well grow which will help us invest more in drupal we hope it becomes a virtuous cycle
1100334 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1100335 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1100336 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1100337 was that he didnt want to go to school because he thought the school was trying to kill him
1100338 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1100339 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1100340 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
1100341 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
1100342 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1100343 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1100344 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1100345 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1100346 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1100347 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1100348 you feel like you know everything once youve been a waitress
1100349 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1100350 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1100351 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1100352 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1100353 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1100354 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1100355 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1100356 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1100357 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1100358 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1100359 so how does it work kevin whats the experience like
1100360 but what if i dont have a media center kevin
1100361 i have signed up for way to many things and i am having a hard time advertising all the things i am signed up for i want to be able to give one webpage to all my colleagues to show them my work in different web 2 0 mediums
1100362 he was always willing to plead guilty to culpable homicide but this was flatly rejected by the crown and that is why a trial was necessary
1100363 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1100364 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1100365 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1100366 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1100367 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1100368 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1100369 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1100370 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1100371 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1100372 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1100373 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1100374 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1100375 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

1100388 sales were driven in part by large shares of deeply discounted distressed sales in many parts of the state
1100389 with lower prices and favorable interest rates affordability also has improved significantly in recent months paving the way for many buyers to purchase their first home
1100390 the significant declines in the median price over the past several months are largely due to a dramatic shift in the sales mix since the onset of the credit crunch and the increase in the share of distressed sales
1100391 a year ago the under 500 000 price range accounted for 40 percent of sales the middle segment made up about 45 percent and the over 1 million segment captured 15 percent of the market as of june 2008 the shares had shifted to 67 percent 24 percent and 9 percent respectively

1100651 rafael ist ein sehr wichtiger spieler vermutlich der beste hsv spieler in den letzten 25 jahren seine tore seine assists und seine pers nlichkeit werden uns fehlen er hat hier bis zum letzten tag gas gegeben
1100652 ich habe in ihm einen freund f rs leben gefunden bin stolz auf ihn und finde es klasse dass er jetzt beim gr ten fu ballverein der welt spielt er hat sich in der kabine von jedem spieler einzeln verabschiedet wir hatten eine sch ne zeit mit ihm

1100658 er wollte im sommer sterben und er ist im sommer gestorben er wollte zu hause sterben und er ist zu hause gestorben ich w rde sagen dass alexander ein schwieriges aber gl ckliches leben hatte
1100659 solschenizyn war ein unerschrockener k mpfer gegen willk r er hat durch sein werk entscheidend zur berwindung des kommunistischen totalitarismus beigetragen
1100660 solschenizyns tod ist ein schwerer verlust f r ganz russland wir werden ihn als starken und mutigen menschen in erinnerung behalten
1100661 er war einer der ersten der laut ber das inhumane stalinistische system und die menschen sprach die es erlitten aber nicht gebrochen wurden
1100662 man wird sich an solschenizyn vor allem wegen seiner historischen leistung erinnern als er die aufmerksamkeit auf das sowjetische lagersystem lenkte und eine intellektuelle auseinandersetzung mit kommunismus und marxismus in gang setzte die damals die gesamte westliche welt ergriff
1100663 the bottom line is that etoys had the potential to be a great 500 million company but it was masquerading as a 5 billion company
1100664 i think that overall it was a well run company but in hindsight it built too big an infrastructure and spent too much money too quickly had the company grown more slowly perhaps it could have survived the market downturn and grown into a nice 300 to 500 million company

1100730 the fact that virginia is even up for grabs tells you a lot
1100731 if you had told me four years ago that a democratic presidential candidate would be running a competitive race in virginia and would open 10 offices i would say that is spectacular
1100732 now we have a guy who has opened 20 to 30 offices around the state youve got to be kidding me
1100733 we have traditionally been the party who can get their people to the polls when its a presidential race

1100768 from the right have come attacks based on cultural anxieties of being overrun by mexican immigrants and fears that cooperation with canada and mexico could lead down a slippery slope toward a north american union
1100769 from the left came attacks based on economic fears of jobs lost due to unfair trading practices
1100770 these two sets of fears came together in a perfect storm that was pushed forward by a surplus of hot air from talk show hosts on radio and television
1100771 in the face of this criticism the bush administration was silent and the democratic candidates competed for votes in the rust belt states where unions and many working people have come to see nafta and globalization much as commentator lou dobbs does
1100772 dobbs among others viewed a report by a 2005 council on foreign relations task force which i chaired building a north american community as the manifesto of a conspiracy to subvert american sovereignty
1100773 dobbs claimed that the cfr study proposed a north american union although it did not
1100774 three sovereign governments that seek to strengthen bonds of cooperation
1100775 i dont think a political union of north america is an inherently bad idea nor do i think it is a good idea for right now

1100822 any change in any element would destroy the entire system
1100823 i t may well be that he takes the position he does because he regards it as the true implications of other logically related principles
1100824 but the imperfections that are ordinary and constant in me it would be treachery to remove
1100825 b y the very nature of inductive knowledge philosophic principles are subject to further confirmation qualification or revision
1100826 certain concepts to which the theory of measurement omission seemed inapplicable
1100827 issues are available only in the sense that the relevant facts can be grasped without specialized research
1100828 the facts which both required the formation of the concept
1100829 however upon further investigation we found tiny scratches in the metal on the lock to mr sinclairs apartment they are consistent with the marks made by a lockpicking device
1100830 mostly they have stated that the department and myself included will be subject to great personal embarrassment if we didnt conclude the investigation in this case as quickly and quietly as possible
1100831 this sort of sudden removal of a persons benefits rarely happens
1100832 i saw during the clinton years where people drawing benefits would have their cases audited or their benefits removed as a way of putting political pressure upon opponents but this is the first time ive seen such pressure being applied before a person is even in office
1100833 i planned on voting for him however now that i see what hes capable of i dont feel comfortable with him being our president in fact the idea of him becoming president now scares me
1100834 drink driving has not only taken lives it also has a bad effect on others such as the families of these innocent people i appeal to all drivers not to drive after they have consumed alcohol

1100836 my mother in law and i can only rely on each other for support we hope that our application for a subsidised housing unit can be approved soon as we want to save money instead of renting an apartment which cost about hk 5 000 a month
1100837 at present drivers who are arrested by police officers can still drive we think this is very dangerous as the drivers might get drunk and drive again the next day it is very dangerous to road users we cannot wait till the court has delivered a judgment to stop them driving we should stop them at once

1100839 americas 35 corporate tax rate is not just bad economics its downright unpatriotic
1100840 we try to get the word out so people dont get concerned if they see a helicopter hovering near our lines or equipment
1100841 ayn rand has said everything in philosophy and thus philosophy is closed to additions new ideas etc
1100842 strawman that misses some key insight though not a terribly bad strawman
1100843 to be objectivists in other words we must abandon rationality to be rational we must be ready at any moment to abandon objectivism
1100844 a closed system by contrast is defined by specific articles of faith usually laid out in some canonical text internal debates are highly constrained and usually short lived they are typically settled by a ruling from some authority
1100845 and the system of objectivism must be dead in its turn because a single false philosophical proposition in the randian corpus gives randians the choice between deliberately accepting a system that includes falsehoods or hitting the road out of rand land rands belief that newborn infants experience pure sensations has turned out to be false she enunciated it as part of her epistemology therefore the whole system is already dead

1100847 5 to get to r5 i would end up on r4 due to the missing line 3 i eventually got used to this but it did end up making me configure the wrong device a couple of times
1100848 a repeat of the failed extremist politics that have characterized and plagued democratic party politics since the late 1960s
1100849 anyone who accepted all of these ideas would have to consider himself an objectivist
1100850 objectivism is even open to revisions in light of new evidence as long as the revisions are consistent with the central principles of the philosophy such as the efficacy of reason and the individuals right to live for his own happiness
1100851 identify the boundaries of the debate and development that may take place within objectivism as a school of thought
1100852 use whatever objectivist principles and insights you think are true and discard false ideas while giving appropriate credit but give up calling yourself an objectivist once you dont advocate all of its principles anymore

1101087 only voluntary leisure time exercise is influenced by genetic factors whereas the other type of exercise directed and monitored by someone else is environment driven the absence of causal effects of voluntary exercise on symptoms of anxiety and depression does not imply that manipulation of exercise cannot be used to change such symptoms
1101088 the antidepressant effects of exercise may only occur if the exercise is monitored and part of a therapeutic program
1101089 our son mark got involved in sport stacking about a year and a half ago through his school hillcrest academy in shelburne ns
1101090 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
1101091 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
1101092 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
1101093 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
1101094 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
1101095 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
1101096 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
1101097 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
1101098 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
1101099 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
1101100 a secondhand iphone in reasonable working order is valuable to our iphone repair company
1101101 customers are always surprised to find that their secondhand apple iphone can be sold for a great price that can be used towards the purchase of a brand new iphone
1101102 while a new iphone screen is more costly than an average ipod screen replacement many iphone owners decide that the repair expense is warranted
1101103 we are surprised by the number of messages and phone calls we receive from customers that have a damaged iphone lcd and want to get it fixed

1101110 sometimes we want nanomaterial to be toxic like when its used in chemotherapy
1101111 but we dont want toxic side effects in nanomaterials that are repelling stains

1101123 i have very much enjoyed working for the brighton central school district
1101124 its a wonderful district and i enjoyed the challenges of the job but after 33 years in the business and 15 as a school superintendent i think it might be time
1101125 i dont know if the board itself will do the search or if we will hire somebody else or an outside search organization
1101126 we had eagle do the search for us then we went to our then superintendent harv peris to recommend people whom he thought would do the job and thats how we met dr manaseri

1101189 it was just a self inflicted scratch but you see i got a purple heart for it
1101190 i am absolutely convinced that we as religious leaders and we in the religious community that so shunned and shamed people with hiv and struggling with aids must begin first by engaging in public acts of repentance
1101191 absent public acts of repentance i fear our words will not be trusted
1101192 to believe that sophie and herlyn have today become christ to us
1101193 ending discrimination and stigmatization means we are committed to move from exceptions to expectations of the full participation of people living with hiv in our communities of faith
1101194 but thats only half of the call the other half of the call is to stand with people at the margins so that they will no longer be marginalized i think too often christians have found their comfort zone in acts of charity compassion and love rather than the struggle for justice and the full inclusion of marginalized people
1101195 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law

1101198 i demand that those pacs members and candidates who received donations from this unethical pac return this tainted money money that was taken off the backs and sometimes the broken backs of hardworking injured oklahomans
1101199 the deceitful tactics used by these workers compensation attorneys to gather these donations are reminiscent of old louisiana style corruption we dont need this kind of politics in oklahoma so were hopeful that the democrat candidates and pacs who took this dirty money will agree with us and return these contributions
1101200 the attorneys involved in this secretive scheme have proven they will stop at nothing to funnel money to candidates who will block workers compensation reform lawsuit reform and other pro jobs reforms that would benefit oklahoma workers

1101269 generally subprime lending and the foreclosure crisis is presented as if it is only an issue for minority and low income borrowers

1101271 we need a break with the past with the old and accepted way of thinking and a commitment to change ourselves so we can enact real change for the people of pennsylvania

1101350 radio stations based at universities make up only about 11 of all over the air stations in the united states of america but college radio is often presented as offering an alternative in music radio to the for profit stations that dominate the airwaves college stations are now seen as a key means of promoting indie rock this article traces the development of university based radio stations in the united states and reports on a five year study of music programming in three stations based in boston and new york to examine their claim to alternativeness the paper concludes that the stations do use different forms of music programming that the programming extends well beyond the scope of indie rock
1101351 there is not one type of alternativeness and the distinctive sense of alternativeness articulated by the jazz world indie rock folk and americana music played on the college stations was as much rooted in the cultural histories of those musical genres as it was in the way they were programmed and presented
1101352 in my independent discussions with three station presenters they each stated that they had a very committed listenership in the boston area but they also argued that it was widely perceived that most boston college students were not interested in the stations output in doing so they constructed parallels between their own personal sense of being outside of mainstream college life with the commitment of a group outside the university and a musical form that they perceived to be alternative and underground
1101353 in our conversations the staff went to particular lengths to distance themselves from the college rock forms of radio they perceived as the norm in college stations the presenters selected music on a track by track basis as the show progressed usually chosen in response to the record currently playing most often these records were from a pile the presenter had pre selected and brought in from their own collection but also drew on records from the stations extensive library
1101354 a blend of folk rock jazz world blues soul electronic and reggae
1101355 by the end of the five year period the stations daytime programming operated on an entirely centralised playlist although the presenters of the specialist reggae and hip hop shows had freedom to select their own music
1101356 rather than a commitment to a particular lifestyle wers staff were either interested in a career in broadcasting or felt that it was an effective way to pursue their interest in particular kinds of music
1101357 station staff spoke quite proudly of the station as an aaa station and their role in establishing the format within more conventional radio practice this format album adult alternative is relatively new in us radio although it has antecedents in adult oriented rock aor and adult contemporary ac formats as the names suggest all three are aimed at adult aged 25 listeners and grew out of fm radio aaa stations are presented in the words of station staff as offering an alternative to the rock clich s and rock lite formula of aor and the pop sensibilities of ac by playing music at the margins of american rock with a strong folk acoustic and world music flavour
1101358 while staff at wzbc and wers in 2003 felt that it was important to have music and other programming systems that differed from for profit stations wfuv saw these as professional tools their professionalism was very important to them and they used this self identity to distinguish themselves from other college stations on the other hand they associated themselves with the colleges commitment to education as a way of distinguishing their values from those of the stations whose primary objective was profit
1101359 wfuv 90 7 fm will launch an alternate channel online and in hd at 90 7 fm in the new york city area to include a blend of established and emerging nyc based indie rock electronica world dance and other musical hybrids in fall 2008 the new site is supported in part by the new york state music fund established by the new york state attorney general at rockefeller philanthropy advisors
1101360 the case studies reveal that there is no one form or expression of alternativeness in american radio more important than a simplistic sense of college music as alternative rock it is the themes of progress cultural uplift and alternative lifestyle that have threaded throughout the development of american education and broadcasting and they continue to play an important part in the discursive practices of college radio today

1101367 if you dont fly the flag you are not loyal
1101368 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
1101369 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
1101370 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
1101371 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
1101372 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
1101373 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
1101374 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
1101375 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
1101376 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
1101377 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
1101378 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
1101379 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards

1101387 according to the fable a hungry wolf came upon a sheeps fleece lying on the ground in a field the wolf realized that if it wore the fleece it would look like a sheep from a distance that would enable the wolf to sneak up on a flock of sheep and steal a lamb for its supper before the shepherd noticed his presence the wolf put on the fleece and went off in search of a flock of sheep it spied a flock of sheep just as the sun was setting and approached the flock just as it was about to pounce on a lamb a shepherd came by looking for a sheep to slaughter for supper thinking the disguised wolf was a sheep the shepherd quickly grabbed and killed the wolf an alternative version is another wolf is sneaking around looking for a sheep for dinner and pounces on the wolf in sheeps clothing killing it and eating it for supper instead of a real sheep

1101395 i liked armenia very much it beat all my expectations yerevan had a good reputation to me before i came here i heard a lot about it from my armenian friends and turkish friends who have been to yerevan and this reputation just improved
1101396 only one of my friends warned me before i came here he said like we have fanatics in turkey there might be fanatics in armenia so just i had to be careful about it but i dont care about that kind of things what i believe if you think nice about people and keep your smile on your face you will have no problems
1101397 people here offer me a place to stay asking me if were okay i was drinking and eating with many guys and they were very friendly and right now i have armenian friends in armenia as i have in turkey
1101398 i heard that our government doesnt allow armenians to climb ararat this is stupid and i feel shame because of our government
1101399 i know the topic very well the mountain means two different things for two different nations
1101400 i know what the mountain means for armenians and what it means for the turkish people except for mountaineers ararat doesnt mean much for us it is the highest mountain of the country also there are books and songs about ararat in turkey but it is not as much important for us turks as for you armenians
1101401 in turkish we call it aghri daghi aghri means pain daghi means mountain but when we put these words together it does not mean mountain of pain
1101402 i think masis is important for armenians because it used to be an armenian land before and right now it is across the border and they cant even go to climb the mountain everybody misses to be around the ararat go there visit it maybe climb up the mountain but they cant go to visit and climb it
1101403 i dont want this border to be closed i dont want people to have bad ideas about each others we used to live together for centuries something very terrible happened in 1915 and after that time we have these borders and soldiers between us and also governments i must say we just cant reach peace there are some people trying to do something about it one of them was hrant dink and we know what happened
1101404 the government says turks didnt kill armenians they just say that they forced those people to leave the country and on the way they got sick and died and lots of people still believe in this because this is in history books they still teach this i have been taught this way too
1101405 to break all this propaganda and get to the truth
1101406 few people are doing that and it is not easy to change whats going on it is not easy to change school books everybody knows that armenian people live in turkey but few know how the hell it ended up like this when we change the books and start to teach people the truth and after like 10 15 years well have a new generation knowing something else than old government propaganda
1101407 the situation must change the only thing that can help is pressure of other countries european countries the united states but it mustnt be a political tool this what hrant dink was saying
1101408 not only once ill come many times i hope right now i have many friends here id like to visit them one day i didnt manage because of time to visit and shoot something else than the mountain so id like to come again and visit more places as well
1101409 in many western countries children grow up by listening to tales of their parents but i spent all my childhood listening to stories that were full of pain
1101410 at the very moment i took my first step out of the plane i smelled that indescribable smell as if it had been familiar to me for ages this brought peace to my soul
1101411 my students have suffered traumas but i keep advising them to look at life through an objective lens even to painful events
1101412 rather than brainwashing young generations with poisonous ideas we should raise them up by planting the seeds of peaceful ideas
1101413 i was fighting with the armenian inside me my soul was deep in conflict
1101414 when i gave my passport to the policeman my heart was about to stop beating i was so worried but he behaved in a very respectful manner and said to me welcome to turkey this was incredible
1101415 i was wondering what turks going about their daily life would think of me
1101416 the seller was surprised and putting aside a packet of turkish delight in his hand he asked if i come to armenia would they kill me there
1101417 a network of american scholars are financed by hundreds of thousands of dollars each year from the government of turkey who promote the denial of the armenian genocide
1101418 i was going to watch him writhe like a poisoned cockroach for a few seconds then kick him onto his stomach and put three bullets in the back of his head i had a gun and a silencer and a plan
1101419 smyrna with all its wealth and treasure was ours the fleeing greek army had abandoned huge quantities of military stores and food supplies that were desperately needed by our armies and civilians these have been destroyed together with the ware houses and stations where many of the fires broke out besides the fleeing greeks and armenians many of them wealthy as you know had abandoned everything in their homes and their stores we were in absolute and undisputed possession do you think we are such fools as to have destroyed everything
1101420 as war was not enough we had lost many of our soldiers during these trips my father used to get very emotional while talking about these occurrences as he could not bear the captivity circumstances any more and he had escaped from the prison camp by taking the support of the turkish associations that were located in azerbaijan during his escape he was caught he was put in the jail for months by the russians and he had grapple with death and contagious diseases like typhoid fever caused by louses these were not pronounced or talked at the near history studies very much
1101421 almost all of our prisoners stated that armenians had treated turkish prisoners very badly
1101422 the fact that 35 40 turkish prisoners died everyday at the prisoner camps where armenian doctors were present was also reflected at the russian archives these people had not died but were killed just because the necessary health conditions were not met

1101473 today we need to prove that we do care about our past and we are ready to confess our mistakes whatever geopolitical reason they might have had i think filmmaking is a great way to reconcile with armenians who are an important part of our imperial past
1101474 a significant cultural social and economic element of our society was taken out of turkeys mosaic which we kept mentioning as a stronghold of our culture and identity throughout the centuries 1915 was a terrible human disaster causing economic social and political imbalances in eastern turkey while its effects still dominate our problems there
1101475 its authenticity complexity and the sorrow in peoples eyes had been striking me while i was on my photographic journeys along the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline which ive documented extensively since the 1990s
1101476 they had struck me with their unknown origin and the sheer size of them standing up against time
1101477 some of the witnesses of this era and members of the oral history project were saying that some people in this village are the descendants of converted armenians who either silently or by force became muslims to be able to avoid deportation in 1915
1101478 my initial journalistic instinct told me to keep a distance to these rural historic conversations by using the camera as an observer only
1101479 we are able to understand economic and social links between armenians and turks prior to 1915 thanks to sincere conversations between village elders and youngsters
1101480 yet memories remain and live throughout generations if not condemned or discriminated just because of their being different this is exactly how this small village in the taurus mountains was able to develop a liberal open and peaceful society without getting too much polarized throughout the 20th century geben is a perfect example of how different roots and cultures can live peacefully together or side by side even today
1101481 village youngsters leading oral history conversations were present at the wedding a year ago but theyd grown up or changed so we needed to make sure the audience didnt feel disturbed by those visual changes the entire filming process required a lot of planning regarding time and lighting so we could fit those different segments in a natural flow
1101482 i received feedback from turkish historians appreciating our work to find out honest and open remarks about 1915
1101483 i also think documentaries are a popular and successful way to convey facts and figures about our history to the general public
1101484 they also asked me why i filmed this documentary as a filmmaker with no armenian or eastern roots armenians today do not know modern turkey besides the fact that intellectuals such as hrant dink can be killed by ultra nationalists simply by talking about the turkish identity and accepting 1915 as genocide they do not expect turkish filmmakers to make fair and objective films or documentaries about 1915
1101485 also some people in the audience in yerevan told their own memories of converted grandmothers and other family members they got very sentimental at certain points but they also laughed a lot during some of the wedding scenes
1101486 in contrast to the turkish governments policy the u s government acknowledges and mourns as historical fact the mass killings ethnic cleansing and forced deportations that devastated over one and a half million armenians at the end of the ottoman empire
1101487 we remain disappointed that ambassador designate yovanovitch provided evasive answers and non responses in reply to senator feingolds clearly articulated questions we are troubled by her assertion that it is somehow an appropriate prerogative of the president in complete disregard of the facts and counter to our nations common morality to allow a foreign country to impose a gag rule on americas defense of human rights
1101488 we do at the same time note that the nominee makes at least a token effort to distance u s policy on the armenian genocide as profoundly flawed as it is from the turkish governments position of outright denial
1101489 what steps is the state department taking to encourage greater study and recognition of the armenian genocide in turkey
1101490 as a recent example the administration is currently laying the groundwork for an international visitor program that would bring archivists from the turkish state archives to the u s to look at the ways in which we do historical research as a confidence building measure the usg has contacted armenian archivists to participate in the program in the hope that upon return the archivists from both countries could work together on a joint program that would study the issue in addition our embassies take every opportunity in meetings with the governments of armenia and turkey and with civil society leaders from both countries to encourage improved dialogue between them since 2006 the usg has provided over 700 000 in support of initiatives to increase people to people connections between armenia and turkey including research projects conferences documentary production and exchange and partnership programs with the goal of increasing cross border dialogue and cooperation these programs are focused on bringing together armenian and turkish ngos think tank researchers academics and business leaders at the grass roots level by creating opportunities for them to work together on common projects that will benefit both countries
1101491 how will you work with your counterparts in ankara to decriminalize discussion of the armenian genocide in turkey is the department satisfied with recent modifications to article 301 of turkeys criminal code that allowed individuals such as hrant dink to be prosecuted for speaking about the genocide why or why not
1101492 the administration has made clear to the turkish authorities on many occasions that such prosecutions violate free expression run counter to turkeys aspiration to join the european union and undercut turkeys strategic significance as an example of a secular democracy that can inspire reform throughout the broader middle east and central asia
1101493 we remain troubled by ambassador yovanovitchs evasive answers her outright non responses and her refusal in her replies to senator obama and other senators to offer anything approaching a reasonable or factually supportable explanation of the reasons behind administrations misguided policy on the armenian genocide
1101494 this being said it appears as though ambassador yovanovitch and her colleagues have learned from the disastrous hoagland experience and are coming to understand that the u s senate will not accept and the armenian american community will never allow an ambassador to armenia who denies the armenian genocide
1101495 i believe in the importance of possible dialogue with turkey
1101496 turkeys internal peace is highly important for us i lost a large part of my family during the painful event that occurred in the past decades i am still a part of those lands my roots belong to those lands thats why a dialogue with turkey is important
1101497 this is actually my second visit to armenia i feel comfortable here turkish and armenian people do have many common characteristics we have a similar perception of life similar eating habits the way we express our happiness etc
1101498 the project is open to all countries in the region who want to contribute to good neighborly relations peace and prosperity
1101499 the baku tbilisi kars railroad project will revive the historic silk road
1101500 the project somehow created a new economic zone that has not been named
1101501 i am glad to see south caucasus giving up illusions and understanding the real state of affairs
1101502 as to rumors that azerbaijan will cede karabakh in case the border is opened its nonsense the karabakh problem can be resolved via our efficacious policy no one will do it instead of us
1101503 turkey should have opened the border long ago thus making armenian economy dependent on turkish capital and allowing ankara to gain influence on the public opinion moreover this circumstance would be positive for resolution of the nagorno karabakh conflict the situation in the region is changing not everything in the world is measured by petrodollars west forced turkey to reconcile with armenia the same will happen to azerbaijan which will open its border with armenia one day but armenians should first give up their erroneous policy and stop living in a dream
1101504 i am proud to be endorsing nikki and hope she wins her august 7th primary race i believe nikki will bring the energy intellect and integrity the people of tennessees ninth congressional district need and deserve i also believe that people like steve cohen who are playing an active role in blocking legislation in congress that would mark the first genocide of the 20th century armenian genocide have no place in congress
1101505 sadly cohen is an apologist for the turkish government which has never admitted to genocide
1101506 in contrast to the turkish governments policy the u s government acknowledges and mourns as historical fact the mass killings ethnic cleansing and forced deportations that devastated over one and a half million armenians at the end of the ottoman empire
1101507 we remain disappointed that ambassador designate yovanovitch provided evasive answers and non responses in reply to senator feingolds clearly articulated questions we are troubled by her assertion that it is somehow an appropriate prerogative of the president in complete disregard of the facts and counter to our nations common morality to allow a foreign country to impose a gag rule on americas defense of human rights
1101508 we do at the same time note that the nominee makes at least a token effort to distance u s policy on the armenian genocide as profoundly flawed as it is from the turkish governments position of outright denial
1101509 we remain troubled by ambassador yovanovitchs evasive answers her outright non responses and her refusal in her replies to senator obama and other senators to offer anything approaching a reasonable or factually supportable explanation of the reasons behind administrations misguided policy on the armenian genocide
1101510 this being said it appears as though ambassador yovanovitch and her colleagues have learned from the disastrous hoagland experience and are coming to understand that the u s senate will not accept and the armenian american community will never allow an ambassador to armenia who denies the armenian genocide
1101511 armenian americans welcome these charges as a meaningful step forward in the international movement to end the cycle of genocide
1101512 we are hopeful that this legal milestone will mark a turning point toward decisive action on the part of the united states the u n security council and the international community to end khartoums brutal and systematic drive to destroy the population of darfur through massacre disease and malnutrition
1101513 the world at large primarily the security council has allowed al bashir to continue his reign of destruction recalcitrance and violence with utter impunity moreno ocampo has acted now the security council must as well
1101514 this internship is really meant to serve as a training mechanism for the next generation of activists in the armenian community throughout the americas
1101515 we are pleased to welcome this group of highly motivated interns to dc and have them hit the ground running as they gain the first hand experience needed to effectively advance armenian american issues
1101516 armenia should decide should the problems continue or should we open a new chapter in relations
1101517 i am behind what i said there are problems regarding freedoms in turkey the categorical rejection of these problems means ignoring the facts about turkey
1101518 such a participation would depend on the developments ahead of the match
1101519 the normalization of relations with armenia is one of turkeys serious foreign policy goals
1101520 armenian genocide recognition issue and armenias territorial claims as well as opening of the border will remain on the agenda of the armenian turkish relations for a long period of time
1101521 we remain troubled by yovanovitchs evasive answers and her absolute refusal to offer anything approaching a reasonable or factually supportable explanation of the reasons behind administrations misguided policy on the armenian genocide
1101522 reputation of a nation is put at stake when demanding high rank diplomats to lie or to distort the truth in compliance with the countrys foreign policy the policy of denying the armenian genocide which is known to everyone is a result of pressure exerted by the turkish government which undermines our confidence
1101523 besides the administration is currently laying the groundwork for an international visitor program that would bring archivists from the turkish state archives to the u s to look at the ways in which we do historical research as a confidence building measure the u s government has contacted armenian archivists to participate in the program in the hope that upon return the archivists from both countries could work together on a joint program that would study the issue in addition our embassies in armenia and turkey take every opportunity in meetings with the governments of these two countries and with civil society leaders from both countries to encourage improved dialogue between them
1101524 we need 35 000 euros to take photographs of the old issues and make a digital archive
1101525 you are telling me that the diaspora is making more effort to resolve the issue of the genocide of armenians however this kind of attitude is detrimental to our people in the first place because in order to find correct decisions and draw correct conclusions we need a broad outlook however we will not have it if our priority task is confrontation with someone rather than increasing our peoples welfare this does not mean that the government does not want the genocide to be recognized but it has at the same time to organize the countrys economy and care about our citizens wellbeing
1101526 there are voices among young people about the inadmissibility of any ties with those countries there are people who believe that they should not wear turkish made suits or brush their teeth with turkish made toothpaste we have to fight for the restoration of historical justice and our peoples dignity but one should not think that this should be done in this way at a domestic scale we have to protect our dignity and respect ourselves one must not let the striving for justice respect for the memory of our history and our ancestors be distorted and degraded and transformed into unrestrained aggression we all no matter whether we live in armenia and outside it constitute an inseparable unity since we belong to the same nation our goal must be the creation of a politically and economically strong motherland
1101527 turkish american relations would significantly develop during obamas presidency obama would not take one sided decisions and he would display respect for the role of the united nations and nato obamas presidency would be a positive term for turkish american relations
1101528 those are turkeys domestic matters it is the turkish people who have to solve the issues there is a strong atmosphere that allows debate in turkey democracy in turkey will not only survive but it will also be successful in the country
1101529 everyone talks about the strong jewish lobby in the united states i believe that turkish americans will one day become as strong as the jewish lobby in the u s
1101530 we cali for an end to the killing of one another and vve denounce the violence and fanaticism that threatens life
1101531 these contacts are important for normalization of relations there are problems and also disagreement over events of 1915 but we favor a constructive approach and dialogue to overcome these
1101532 there is no need to attribute different meanings to these contacts
1101533 despite turkish efforts to deepen cooperation with other regional countries at the expense of landlocked armenia guls visit to ani is a sign of readiness to improve ties with yerevan armenia wants turkey to restore medieval churches in ani and turkish authorities began renovation works in the city early this year
1101534 we have problems about current issues and disagreements about the 1915 events it is essential that these problems are handled through dialogue
1101535 the time has come for a fresh effort to break this deadlock a situation that helps no one and hurts many as president of armenia i take this opportunity to propose a fresh start a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey with the goal of normalizing relations and opening our common border
1101536 whereas the greatness of the united states is in large part attributable to its having been able through the democratic process to achieve a harmonious national unit of its people even though they stem from the most diverse of racial religious and ethnic backgrounds and
1101537 armenia is to decide should the problems continue or should we open a new chapter in relations
1101538 the past is the job of historians while politicians should look to the future
1101539 the turkish stance on the 1915 killings and told them ankaras proposal to set up a joint commission of independent academics to study the allegations was still on the table
1101540 i am behind what i said there are problems regarding freedoms in turkey the categorical rejection of these problems means ignoring the facts about turkey
1101541 we want to thank joe knollenberg for his leadership in seeking to zero out military aid to azerbaijan and to express our appreciation to all those like congressmen adam schiff and mark kirk who supported this vital legislative effort to promote peace and stability in the caucasus
1101542 at the same time especially given the razor thin margin of this vote we are saddened and disappointed by the opposition of chairwoman lowey and the other representatives who although traditionally friends of the armenian american community cast their votes to block the adoption of this badly needed measure jesse jackson jr steve israel ben chandler steve rothman barbara lee betty mccollum and david obey
1101543 for the security of armenia and the region i strongly believe that the azeri war machine must be stopped this is why it is completely unbelievable and unacceptable that there would be any u s funding of azerbaijans military i will fight to strip this money from the budget to ensure armenias continued safety the u s absolutely must not fund or support the azeri bellicose behavior
1101544 resolution to condemn turkey for the armenian genocide almost a century ago
1101545 the well oiled accession process is moving forward without concrete steps by turkey to enact reforms as has been the will of the european people
1101546 signals leniency from european institutions toward severe shortcomings of this candidate country
1101547 express his opposition to turkeys membership by clearly stating conditions which must be fulfilled by the applicant country
1101548 aggressive state doctrine stemming from an ideology which disappeared in europe at the end of world war ii
1101549 at the time we worked with the european commission council and parliament to promote the inclusion of the armenian genocide in the final wording of this framework decision today we have succeeded in doing so
1101550 in a nutshell we ask the french presidency to provide political and legal content to its protective europe concept in reinforcing prevention and penalization measures against the proliferation of genocide denial in europe
1101551 turkey may give up nagorno karabakh issue for its own interests
1101552 the problem of hamshen and hamshen armenians attracts more and more attention i am hopeful that this conference will help us to better understand the peculiarities of our nation and its manifestations in various geographical and religious spheres
1101553 the problem is also in focus in turkey certainly we cant agree with some turkish historians who rate hamshen armenians as turkic tribes
1101554 these are not declarative announcements but turkeys state policy of the global geopolitics clashed in the south caucasus and turkey doesnt want to lose this big game that is why it has to open a kind of dialogue with armenia but it doesnt mean that turkey will sacrifice azerbaijans interests turkish people wont allow the authorities to meet armenia halfway ignoring the interests of a fraternal country
1101555 relations between turkey and russia have improved recently the russian factor is gaining weight on ankara i do not rule out that the armenian turkish talks were discussed during lavrovs visit its well known that armenia wont take a step without coordinating it with moscow
1101556 this project is open to all countries in the region who wish to contribute to good neighborly relations peace and prosperity
1101557 we have problems about current issues and disagreements about the events of 1915 it is essential that these problems are handled through dialogue
1101558 meetings between members of the foreign ministries of the two countries are part of these contacts we believe that no different meaning should be attributed to these meetings
1101559 surprised the president of the republic of turkey abdullah g l stopped for a moment overlooking the canyon at the bottom of which the river flows araxe natural line that separates turkey from armenia
1101560 a new phase of dialogue with the government and the people of turkey
1101561 we are trying for years to bring peace to the region
1101562 we want to safeguard our common culture which is caucasian said ilhan ko ulu the project proponent
1101563 using the armenian factor iran is willing to put pressure on turkey in fact turkey was the first to toy with iran and put its cards on the table against this country and now in response official teheran is eager to put pressure on turkey using armenia as its trump card
1101564 we still have disagreements over the events of 1915 but we favor a constructive approach and are eager to have a dialogue on solving the problems
1101565 i think turkish leadership may undertake this step but this will be turkeys mistake as concessions in nagorno karabakh conflict will be immediately followed by concessions of armenia in the issue of 1915 genocide which implies concessions in the issues of compensations to the genocide victims and in the issues of territorial claims by armenia to turkey
1101566 within various initiatives weve been meeting with armenians in different european cities in oslo in salzburg we proposed to establish joint commission for investigation of historic events but have not received positive response yet we cannot achieve the opening of dashnak archives in boston no results have been achieved at these meetings so far let our azerbaijani brothers not worry any step against our brothers is out of the question at the meetings held by the foreign ministry and our institute as well there is no room for concern the meetings may be even assessed as exerting pressure on armenians through our demands
1101567 the rumours that azerbaijan might cede nagorno karabakh to armenia are obviously untrue the nagorno karabakh conflict can be settled only through azerbaijans effective policy only we can solve this problem the situation is changing in the region and in the whole world but our authorities are reluctant to notice the change oil dollars do not decide everything in the world sometimes we must look around and weigh the situation the west made turkey establish relations with armenia and it will make azerbaijan too soon the day will arrive when azerbaijan will open its borders to armenia but in order to achieve it armenians have to give up their misleading policy and stop living in the world of myths
1101568 and of course the side that will be quicker in smoothing away the controversies will win the pr war and will blame the other side for collapsing the commission
1101569 in case the president of turkey or any other authority leader arrives in yerevan on september 6 the armenian authorities should follow the protocol of visiting the memorial to the genocide victims and lay flowers to perpetuate their memory but the problem is if turkish officials will agree to it on april 21 1993 former president of armenia levon ter petrossian left for ankara and obeyed the protocol by visiting the mausoleum of ataturk unfortunately the highly emotional and sentimental issue of the armenian genocide is transformed into political football no one has the right to make political deals at the expense of recognition of this atrocious crime the armenian issue must not be subject to manipulations neither by the turks nor by the armenians
1101570 this was impossible a mere twenty years ago since the archives were closed now theyre open and they give me whatever i want i havent encountered any problems to date
1101571 rober for the love of god doesnt write such things
1101572 we just want normal relations with our neighbors and stand for normalization of relations with turkey without preconditions president sargsyans invitation is a good will gesture which never means that we question the fact of genocide we will not make concessions in recognition of turkeys borders or in the nagorno karabakh issue either now we are waiting for turkeys response
1101573 these meetings will be about karabakh conflict and are organized by the efforts of the three co chairmen the proposals made in madrid will be discussed serge sargsyan and ilham aliev confirmed that the negotiations will continue on the bases of the before mentioned proposals
1101574 we give special importance to karabakh issue we usually have different discussions with nkr authorities regarding this issue we have already had three meetings with azerbaijani foreign minister before the meetings between serge sargsyan and ilham aliev in strasburg and st petersburg the fourth meeting will be on august 1 in moscow i will also meet with osce minsk group co chairmen and we will do our best to achieve the settlement of karabakh conflict
1101575 the meeting between the two presidents last more than two hours the discussions were rather meaningful constructive and in the atmosphere of mutual trust the possibilities of bilateral cooperation in different spheres as well as different regional and international issues were discussed
1101576 freed didnt make similar statement during his visit in the usa we had a very constructive meeting with him and other us officials but we didnt have any concrete meeting in vienna simply according to the regulation the ambassadors of our country must meet and see off those armenian guests who travel by transit tours maybe de puichi gave you those details but i dont have similar information
1101577 if you are concerned that a certain committee is going to discuss the issue of the genocide than i must repeat a very simple truth to make it clear once and forever armenian authorities will never take a step that will encourage the denial of the genocide similar thing cant happen
1101578 whom do they want to bite with those teeth we attach great importance to establishing friendly relations with georgia we are going to take all the possible measures to consolidate relations with georgia we never ignore any issue regarding georgian armenians we hope all the issues will be solved i believe there is no unsolvable issue between armenia and georgia because our steps derive from the interests of the both countries
1101579 on one side is tennessee cong steve cohen whos fought the armenian genocide resolution tooth and nail even held a press conference against this legislation just last week in his local paper he bragged that among his biggest accomplishments was unraveling a resolution to condemn turkey for the armenian genocide almost a century ago on the other hand you have nikki tinker a principled community leader who has pledged to fight for armenian genocide recognition to help nagorno karabagh and support armenia she has received broad backing including strong support from the african american community that makes up roughly 60 of the district and nearly 80 of its democratic party
1101580 november election time to reward friends and punish foes in congress
1101581 they seem to have overlooked that 21 members of congress had gone on record siding with the denialist regime in ankara opposing a resolution on the armenian genocide just imagine what would have happened if that resolution had been about the holocaust and even a single member of congress had voted against it justifiably there would have been nationwide condemnation of that legislator who would have been either pressured to resign or defeated during the next election it is simply amazing that 21 members of congress would vote against the armenian genocide and not a whimper is heard from the armenian community and no action is taken against them nevertheless armenian americans can still act against these legislators by contributing funds and voting for candidates challenging them in the november 4 election
1101582 approval of ambassador designate marie yovanovitchs appointment by u s senate foreign relations committee culminated an important milestone toward recognition of the armenian genocide by the u s executive branch
1101583 22 months after senator menendez put his hold on richard hoaglands nomination through the written responses and clarifications of the ambassador designate and the u
1101584 i think the senate will soon confirm ms yovanovitchs nomination and she will arrive in yerevan to assume her duties time and events have demonstrated that the policy and efforts of the armenian american community in general and specifically of the armenian national committee of america were right and efficient i am convinced that with such high level of political influence armenian americans and their supporters in the us legislature will soon attain the recognition of the armenian genocide by the us president it is obvious that turkey not only has no reason to be content with the expressed us current policy but should be extremely concerned that the day is near when the united states of america through its legislature its executive branch and its president will call upon turkey to recognize the armenian genocide
1101585 dear mr chairman i am writing in response to your concerns regarding responses to questions for the record submitted by you and senator menendez regarding the nomination of marie yovanovitch as ambassador to armenia regarding your question 1 ms yovanovitch mentions an international visitors program under consideration that would bring archivists from turkey and armenia to the united states for professional training our goal is to help archivists protect the evidence of the past so that future generations will have the documentation of the mass killings and deportations of armenians committed by ottoman soldiers and other ottoman officials in 1915 our goal is not to open a debate on whether the ottomans committed these horrendous acts it is to help preserve the documentation that supports the truth of those events regarding ms yovanovitchs response to senator menendezs question 8 the administration recognizes that the mass killings ethnic cleansing and forced deportations of over one and a half million armenians were conducted by the ottoman empire we indeed hold ottoman officials responsible for those crimes in her testimony ms yovanovitch tried to convey her deep empathy with the profound suffering of the armenian people and in no way sought to cast any doubt on historical facts we hope this information is helpful to you please do not hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance on this or any other matter
1101586 this is something that can happen any time one of the seyhulislams a title of superior authority on islam says we are people who are used to pack up and be on our way we can go anywhere anytime i believe the same today you do this duty for the state tomorrow you continue as a scientist these are normal things i perceive these things as normal
1101587 both turks and armenians are sick the former because of paranoia the latter because of trauma
1101588 when the left became known in turkey in the beginning of the 60s it spoke only for the proletariat the working class in the 70s we hesitantly added a second oppressed and excluded element despite ourselves because we were staunch kemalists the kurds but after the 80s new categories of oppressed and excluded peoples came into being or came to our attention the alevis the non muslims the roma the homosexuals now to be able to say that we are leftist we have to be the spokespeople for all these oppressed and excluded categories
1101589 so far all these excluded and oppressed people defended their kind only now they have to defend not themselves but each other this is the only way they can save themselves from being excluded and oppressed the socialist will defend the kurd the kurd the armenian the armenian the homosexual the homosexual the alevi the alevi the roma etc
1101590 we also call upon people who are not oppressed and excluded but who have a conscience
1101591 we must not allow turkey to create an illusion about the existence of relations with armenia
1101592 we have the right to express our protest within the civilized norms
1101593 we are currently thinking about what forms it could take
1101594 universal recognition of the genocide is vital for the existence security and future of our people and statehood
1101595 the arf bureaus responsibility is to improve the moral consciousness in armenia strengthen its democratic standards development social stability resolve economic issues and ensure the unity of armenia and the diaspora
1101596 there are 70 000 illegal immigrants from armenia working in turkey
1101597 whoevers passport isnt in a normal state needs to hand over 10
1101598 either the pages are wrinkled or the plastic film covering the photo is unraveling
1101599 she did that in order to get her 10 from you on the way back
1101600 oh so this ali fellow has changed the seat cushions
1101601 without realizing it those people will take you for all youve got
1101602 my young man ive been traveling back and for 16 years now
1101603 you see this guy hamlet here i was the one who took him to istanbul for the first time and showed him the ropes now he thinks hes some big shot or something the way he talks and all later on i pulled him aside and told him so youve forgotten all that youve got selective amnesia or something dont you feel embarrassed
1101604 the police know about all of us where we live etc if they wanted to they could round us all up in one night and deport us
1101605 yeah were illegal if they wanted to they could deport the lot of us but they dont if were grabbed we slip them 10 or 20 and they let us go
1101606 we left our country and wound up in this mess
1101607 kumkapi is again being inhabited by armenians who would have known
1101608 once we were afraid to speak armenian outside the house we only spoke turkish one day i spotted two women in the tramway speaking armenian out loud in front of all without a care in the world i realized then the sense of fear we grew up and lived with slowly but surely we too started to speak armenian out in public im talking about my nervous generation the remnants of those after the genocide who somehow managed to remain armenian here
1101609 later we realized we really had no need for this stuff so we stopped purchasing it
1101610 at first we warmly welcomed these armenians we invited them to our homes and found work for them istanbul armenians dont really have extravagant drinking toasts so when we heard the toasts of these armenians at new years gatherings we got all emotional and patriotic they would say your house is like a second home for us a bit of the country we left behind i believed they would work amass some money and then return to armenia but exactly the opposite happened they got married and settled down they even married turks and kurds then we found out something that really amazed us we would find work for them but theyd then distribute these jobs to one another on a commission basis they would take the passport of the job seeker as collateral threatening not to return it if payment wasnt made for services rendered we only found out about this scheme two years after the fact
1101611 those who came here got divorced the husbands would sit at home while the women worked these wives found a certain freedom and they had every right to they were out there earning a living while the men folk did absolutely nothing
1101612 there arent any because no one is concerned enough to delve into the matter in other words there is no information
1101613 when i spoke to this policeman he stated that they didnt want to round up the armenians because theres no armenian embassy here if we round them up wed have to take care of them the government would have to foot the bill of housing and feeding them in the jails but the police know exactly who lives where
1101614 our community is really the most misfortunate of all are we a colony or not yes we are a colony in the sense that istanbul isnt historic armenian land but we are not a colony since istanbul is in turkey where my fatherland once existed i was born here so were my father and grandfather we armenians have been here for thousands of years
1101615 and when we speak of the armenian community of istanbul we must understand that we are talking about a certain
1101616 there are four churches in this neighborhood sourp yerrortutyun khor virab vosgeperan and sourp harutyun go to all four and you will not find four pious christians amongst them
1101617 in this neighborhood reside the most famous of wealthy compatriots who in recent years have opened up their money bags in the name of charitable works but they only contribute to those benevolent works for which their names will be published in the papers and they themselves glorified they will not give a cent however to those good works worthy of national honor and glory since such contributions will not be covered in the papers it would be downright stupid for one to give two bucks to the national fund and not get his name in the papers
1101618 we cried that day the burly turk said and continued there are 30 million alevis in turkey 20 million kurds and only 20 million actual turks we will eventually triumph
1101619 who brought the greatest pressure to bear down on hrant the turkish government or the armenian church hrant was being attacked from all quarters and all of us followed the spectacle like we were seated at a circus with hrant in the center ring being fired upon day and night we kept him at arms length alone and isolated when they took him to court we didnt even go to the trials hrant also sacrificed himself for us his voice was silenced because the people started to wake up he was becoming dangerous
1101620 man there was a time when robert altman was just a beast
1101621 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
1101622 in japan people are expected to live with two realities tatemae which is what you show in public and honne which is who you really are in private
1101623 the two are separate things and the two realities rarely cross over or comment on each other
1101624 so sufferers just turn inward sinking ever deeper until the end
1101625 even now there are very few counseling or public awareness programs dealing with this problem in fact one strong fear among japanese is that talking about suicide with youngsters might actually prompt them to be suicidal
1101626 this is dedicated to all the people who listened to the fist album and hung around long enough to hear the second

1101632 the cause of the leak has not been determined but we have begun a thorough investigation of the incident to determine the cause the treatment center will remain shut down
1101633 from the street you can hear the water running over the wall
1101634 water coming up to be treated and running over the wall
1101635 i was just concerned it could be a possible health hazard
1101636 no thats not the case we saw it coming out over the wall the containment wall was actually bent from the weight of the water
1101637 radioactive material that might leach out into the river right where the intake for drinking water is thats too close for comfort for me
1101638 i think its asking too much of the river putting it under too much stress
1101639 the state and federal government have been trying to find a way to dispose of this stuff and it looks like were supposed to be the test case
1101640 we realized their technical notification was in one of those many volumes of information waste management sends into us every month
1101641 you could look at it and maybe guess what it all means but wed have to hire three scientists and keep them reading full time to keep track of it all
1101642 they say it has a half life of 30 years meaning it loses half its potency every 30 years well what about all those years it is potent and if it somehow leaks out and gets in the river everyones going to end up drinking it
1101643 all kinds of things trickle down in the water basically everything you throw out god only knows what goes in there
1101644 to me its pretty clear right there on page two of the agreement

1101694 i receive proposals from dashnaks to investigate genocide committed by armenians in turkey
1101695 if abdulla gul visits armenia we will announce a new symbolic start in our relations
1101696 but i cant believe he didnt tell the kids himself
1101697 like my mother always says the government did me the biggest favor of my life
1101698 its not easy to force turkey to recognize the armenian genocide its not easy for armenians to hush up the scandal they caused proposals come from the west but not from armenia as you now the armenian diaspora centers are located in france and the u s we will see how sincere they are we eye serzh sarsgyans proposals in the same context
1101699 the signatories allow for the return of all refugees to their homes left inside the old borders except for those who have joined enemy armies and took up arms against their own state or have participated in wholesale massacres in occupied territories
1101700 yerevan government accepts the sevr treaty which was rejected categorically by the turkish grand national assembly as null and void and commits to recall armenian representative delegations in europe and the united states who have become instigation tools in the hands of some imperialist government and political circles in a bona fide effort to remove all ill thoughts between the two countries the republic of armenia commits to not include ill intended and violent individuals with imperialist designs who have jeopardized peace and security between the two nations
1101701 turkeys demands from us to end the karabakh problem in azerbaijans favor and drop our genocide allegations aside from the legal perspective had no moral basis
1101702 turkey missed the opportunity to normalize relations in 1991 when the soviet union broke apart and when turkey started membership talks with the eu
1101703 the mass killings ethnic cleansing and forced deportations devastated over 1 5 million armenians at the end of the ottoman empire
1101704 as a recent example the administration is currently laying the groundwork for an international visitor program that would bring archivists from the turkish state archives to the united states
1101705 i will refer to this great historic catastrophe as the medz yeghern the term used within armenia
1101706 to promote understanding and reconciliation between the peoples and governments of turkey and armenia
1101707 to end legal action against citizens for expressing their views
1101708 the time has come for a fresh effort to break this deadlock a situation that helps no one and hurts many as president of armenia i take this opportunity to propose a fresh start a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey with the goal of normalizing relations and opening our common border
1101709 after my election in february my turkish counterpart abdullah g l was one of the first heads of state to congratulate me turkeys prime minister recep tayyip erdog an suggested that the doors are open to new dialogue in this new period
1101710 there is no real alternative to the establishment of normal relations between our countries it is my hope that both of our governments can pass through the threshold of this new open door we cannot expect tangible progress without such structured relations only through them can we create an effective dialogue touching upon even the most contentious historical issues
1101711 such messages are helpful yet our proposal to establish a joint commission of historians is still on the table and we have not yet received any response to our letter sent to yerevan
1101712 but we have learned from what journalists have written that his assassination plot was known to many we learned that we lost hrant dink not only as a journalist but also as a citizen to major negligence we are sure that the perpetrators and powers behind this will be sentenced at the end of the process but this is not going to be a satisfactory conclusion for us because a large number of journalist friends of ours are trying to carry on their professions under threat some have to travel around under police protection this shows that journalism is becoming an even more difficult profession in turkey i would like to state on this occasion one more time how strange we find it that authorities are not taking any precautions and are not making any sincere efforts to enforce the law
1101713 the children of this country unfortunately became museum exhibition pieces at a very young age
1101714 i receive proposals from dashnaks to investigate genocide committed by armenians in turkey
1101715 armenians have to establish relations with turkey early or late they will understand that they are in wrong way
1101716 we should consider the issue from other point of view i have received proposals from dahsnaks to investigate the genocide committed by armenians in turkey i assessed the issue if armenians are sincere it will be known in short time i will not believe in sincerity of serzh sargsyan if armenians recognize territorial integrity of turkey stop occupation of nagorno karabakh
1101717 my proposal causes anxiety of dashnaks dashnaks did not think that we would be engaged in this issue seriously proposed money is not little dashnaks can be interested in the proposal sometimes they propose concrete projects i told them that we should conduct discussions on several issues then we can decide what we may discuss
1101718 you know that armenias main diasporas locate in france and the us
1101719 postindependence armenias potential for peaceful development has not been realized as best it could during the nagorno karabakh conflict turkey closed its border with armenia as an expression of ethnic solidarity with turkic azerbaijan the regrettable result is that for almost 15 years the geopolitically vital border between armenia and turkey has become a barrier to diplomatic and economic cooperation it is closed not only to armenians and turks who might want to visit their neighboring countries but to trade transport and energy flows from east to west strategic projects such as the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline and the projected baku tbilisi kars railroad bypass armenia while the existing railway between turkey and armenia remains shut and the armenian people are not the only ones who have suffered from these restrictions and detours all countries in the region and the broader community of european nations pay a high cost for these unnatural barriers to commerce progress and international cooperation the time has come for a fresh effort to break this deadlock a situation that helps no one and hurts many as president of armenia i take this opportunity to propose a fresh start a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey with the goal of normalizing relations and opening our common border after my election in february my turkish counterpart abdullah gul was one of the first heads of state to congratulate me turkeys prime minister recep tayyip erdogan suggested that the doors are open to new dialogue in this new period there is no real alternative to the establishment of normal relations between our countries it is my hope that both of our governments can pass through the threshold of this new open door establishing normal political relations would enable us to create a commission to comprehensively discuss all of the complex issues affecting armenia and turkey we cannot expect tangible progress without such structured relations only through them can we create an effective dialogue touching upon even the most contentious historical issues already on a more personal scale many armenians and turks have found ways to get around the closed border they take advantage of regular charter flights from yerevan to istanbul and antalya there are numerous bus and taxi routes through georgia and container trucks even make the long detour enabling some trade between our two countries and just as the people of china and the united states shared enthusiasm for ping pong before their governments fully normalized relations the people of armenia and turkey are united in their love for football which prompts me to extend the following invitation on sept 6 a world cup qualifier match between the armenian and turkish national football teams will take place in yerevan i hereby invite president gul to visit armenia to enjoy the match together with me in the stadium thus we will announce a new symbolic start in our relations whatever our differences there are certain cultural humanitarian and sports links that our peoples share even with a closed border this is why i sincerely believe that the ordinary people of armenia and turkey will welcome such a gesture and will cheer the day that our borders open there may be possible political obstacles on both sides along the way however we must have the courage and the foresight to act now armenia and turkey need not and should not be permanent rivals a more prosperous mutually beneficial future for armenia and turkey and the opening up of a historic east west corridor for europe the caspian region and the rest of the world are goals that we can and must achieve
1101720 the bureau is adamant that the fact of the armenian genocide is not a subject of discussion and no high ranking official representing armenia may have a different approach
1101721 universal recognition of the genocide is vital for the existence security and future of our people and statehood
1101722 commission to comprehensively discuss all of the complex issues affecting armenia and turkey
1101723 the scholarly community has long since spoken on this issue the international association of genocide scholars has gone so far as to send an open letter to the turkish prime minister to express the pointlessness of such a commission turkey itself scuttled a similar committee because that group properly characterized the armenian genocide
1101724 the recognition of genocide and the reparations that follow is a moral legal and political responsibility that no state can escape
1101725 at this point the only question that remains is when turkey will face that fact stop living in the past and rejoin the international community by recognizing the armenian genocide
1101726 the problems of newly independent nations attempting to build a novel democratic way of life did not end with the break up of the soviet union armenia a small country strategically located between turkey russia iran and the energy rich caspian region is a case in point postindependence armenias potential for peaceful development has not been realized as best it could during the nagorno karabakh conflict turkey closed its border with armenia as an expression of ethnic solidarity with turkic azerbaijan the regrettable result is that for almost 15 years the geopolitically vital border between armenia and turkey has become a barrier to diplomatic and economic cooperation it is closed not only to armenians and turks who might want to visit their neighboring countries but to trade transport and energy flows from east to west strategic projects such as the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline and the projected baku tbilisi kars railroad bypass armenia while the existing railway between turkey and armenia remains shut and the armenian people are not the only ones who have suffered from these restrictions and detours all countries in the region and the broader community of european nations pay a high cost for these unnatural barriers to commerce progress and international cooperation the time has come for a fresh effort to break this deadlock a situation that helps no one and hurts many as president of armenia i take this opportunity to propose a fresh start a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey with the goal of normalizing relations and opening our common border after my election in february my turkish counterpart abdullah g l was one of the first heads of state to congratulate me turkeys prime minister recep tayyip erdogan suggested that the doors are open to new dialogue in this new period there is no real alternative to the establishment of normal relations between our countries it is my hope that both of our governments can pass through the threshold of this new open door establishing normal political relations would enable us to create a commission to comprehensively discuss all of the complex issues affecting armenia and turkey we cannot expect tangible progress without such structured relations only through them can we create an effective dialogue touching upon even the most contentious historical issues already on a more personal scale many armenians and turks have found ways to get around the closed border they take advantage of regular charter flights from yerevan to istanbul and antalya there are numerous bus and taxi routes through georgia and container trucks even make the long detour enabling some trade between our two countries and just as the people of china and the united states shared enthusiasm for ping pong before their governments fully normalized relations the people of armenia and turkey are united in their love for football which prompts me to extend the following invitation on sept 6 a world cup qualifier match between the armenian and turkish national football teams will take place in yerevan i hereby invite president g l to visit armenia to enjoy the match together with me in the stadium thus we will announce a new symbolic start in our relations whatever our differences there are certain cultural humanitarian and sports links that our peoples share even with a closed border this is why i sincerely believe that the ordinary people of armenia and turkey will welcome such a gesture and will cheer the day that our borders open there may be possible political obstacles on both sides along the way however we must have the courage and the foresight to act now armenia and turkey need not and should not be permanent rivals a more prosperous mutually beneficial future for armenia and turkey and the opening up of a historic east west corridor for europe the caspian region and the rest of the world are goals that we can and must achieve
1101727 we applaud turkey for its efforts to facilitate peace talks between israel and syria and for maintaining a close relationship with israel across the board
1101728 we appreciate turkeys role in communicating to iran the seriousness with which the west views its future possible nuclear capability in our meetings we also expressed appreciation of the embrace and support of the jewish community and the frequent public condemnation of anti semitism by president gul both in turkey and abroad we also discussed the close u s turkey relationship especially in the effort to combat terrorism and extremism in the region
1101729 my advice is that turkey be creative and proactive in strengthening the relationship with armenia as a way to deal with the issue
1101730 that will bring about a coming together of history i suggested finding ways to work together that will help change the atmosphere because we have a concern today for the well being of armenia armenia and turkey need to solve this not in a political forum such as congress or parliaments
1101731 we have never negated but have always described the painful events of 1915 1918 perpetrated by the ottoman empire against the armenians as massacres and atrocities
1101732 having said that we continue to firmly believe that a congressional resolution on such matters is a counterproductive diversion and will not foster reconciliation between turks and armenians and may put at risk the turkish jewish community and the important multilateral relationship between turkey israel and the united states
1101733 but i think today there is an understanding of where we were and that we were opposed to congressional legislation and that we stood very firm that that was not the way to resolve the issue and that there is nothing cataclysmic about using the genocide word
1101734 in the conversations i had with all of them i said there is a need to be proactive that they need to deal with live armenians and strengthen the relationship between turkey and armenia and by strengthening the relations today frontier issues opening borders it will place the historical issue in the background and be much easier to deal with
1101735 certain words they want us to use is not going to help one armenian
1101736 how to characterize the mass killings of armenians in 1915
1101737 within weeks of writing about the matter in late 2006 binghamton university professor donald quataert resigned from the board of governors saying the turkish ambassador to the united states told him he had angered some political leaders in ankara and that they had threatened to revoke the institutes funding after a prominent association of middle eastern scholars learned about it they wrote a letter in may to the institute the turkish prime minister and other leaders asking that quataert be reinstated and money for the institute be put in an irrevocable trust to avoid political influence the ambassador of the republic of turkey h e nabi sensoy denied that he had any role in quataerts resignation in a written statement he said that claims that he urged quataert to leave are unfounded and misleading the dispute shows the tensions between money and scholarship and the impact language can have on historical understanding hundreds of thousands of armenians were killed when the ottoman empire collapsed after world war i armenians and turks bitterly disagree over whether it was a campaign of genocide or a civil war in which many turks were also killed
1101738 we will review this matter consistent with the importance of academic freedom and the fact that the institute is independently funded and governed
1101739 the motion underlines that past events like genocide should be recognized only after historians carried out a detailed research in all kinds of archives
1101740 the establishment of a joint historical commission composed of historians and other experts from both sides to study together the events of 1915 and to open the archives of turkey and armenia as well as the archives of all relevant third party countries and share their findings publicly
1101741 collapse of communism in eastern europe and the former soviet republics and particularly the profound psychological effects of these changes
1101742 in contrast to the turkish claims article 60 of osce communique stressed the importance of
1101743 strongly encourages all parliaments to adopt acts regarding recognition of the ukrainian famine holodomor
1101744 once again the turkish government is stretching the truth and is distributing false news in its desperate and futile denial policy of the armenian genocide
1101745 if the turkish government has the chutzpah to twist current events and the deliberations of international organizations it is no wonder that it would be engaged in the denial of the armenian genocide which took place 92 years ago
1101746 turkey should put an end to this deceit and charade which it has been involved in for the past 92 years
1101747 the osce pa committee focused on the problems of transparency in particular the committee on human rights and democracy considered normalization of relations between the organizations member states the author of the resolution is a czech but not a turkish parliamentarian the resolution calls on the osce countries parliaments to resolve bilateral problems via formation of commissions of historians and experts with participation of thirds states not only armenia and turkey experience problems similar problems exist between poland and ukraine france and germany etc i have proposed an amendment to explain that formation of such a commission is impossible due to turkeys ongoing blockade of armenia and my explanation was accepted the armenian delegation wonders why turkish parliamentarians have distorted the contents of the resolution its all the more upsetting after we succeeded in establishing normal relations with the turkish parliamentarians
1101748 adoption of the turkish thesis by the osce is a significant achievement against the armenian allegations also the turkish thesis regarding the events of 1915 was adopted for the first time on an international platform armenia was the only among 56 osce member states to vote against the motion
1101749 the motion says that the osce parliamentary assembly encourages formation of joint commission of historians and experts from the third countries in case of a research into political and military archives to scientifically and impartially enlighten a disputed period in history in an effort to serve transparency and common understanding among the member states
1101750 turkey and russia are two countries whose relations with each other have been proceeding in regards to neighborhood friendship and in every way i believe that all of us will work in cooperation to carry our relations to a further level as both you and we have this political will i believe we can carry this out
1101751 abdullah g l noted turkish construction companies great interest in realizing key infrastructure projects in russia turkey showed interest in attracting construction companies to carry out tasks on the winter olympic games in sochi
1101752 the president has invited turkish president abdullah gul to visit armenia on september 6 to watch the world cup qualifying match between armenia and turkey
1101753 the adl has gone to great length to actively oppose congressional affirmation of the armenian genocide and they have refused to unambiguously acknowledge it
1101754 when you couple the two together it leaves concern as to whether or not they are an appropriate partner for this kind of work theyre engaging in what they have identified as the ultimate form of hate speech genocide denial
1101755 we have never negated but have always described the painful events of 1915 to 1918 perpetrated by the ottoman empire against the armenians as massacres and atrocities if the word genocide had existed then they would have called it genocide having said that we continue to firmly believe that a congressional resolution on such matters is a counterproductive diversion and will not foster reconciliation between turks and armenians and may put at risk the turkish jewish community and the important multilateral relationship between turkey israel and the united states
1101756 clearly there was a genocide against the armenians but its such a heavy duty issue
1101757 were still going to fight hate in marshfield and the adl has been very supportive of our fight against hate weve got a lot more to learn but it doesnt mean locally that were going to give up
1101758 it was certainly never denied the historic suffering of the armenian people and we now do use the term genocide to describe that tragic period of history
1101759 theres really no other program out there thats quite like it and im proud to be a part of it because you see whats possible when you all come together were proud of what the communities have been able to do
1101760 i see scores of local communities who are committed to this work and have found that this program is the best way for them to be able to get a network of support to do this work
1101761 in the south shore alone which marshfield is a welcomed member of there are 13 communities who implement this program and support one another so you dont have to reinvent the wheel every time
1101762 in lexington a woman who was a victim of a hate crime stood up at a board of selectmen meeting during a discussion of whether to maintain no place for hate
1101763 the woman said the no place for hate committee was very helpful and helped her understand personally respond to and come away from that crime in a positive way she said it would have been difficult to get through it without them but had she been an armenian american she would not have been able to go to them it was very powerful for me to hear that from someone who benefited from the good that no place for hate can do but there are genocide survivors or descendants of survivors that would go to them and now cannot
1101764 no matter what the issue of hate needs to be addressed whether through the adl or not
1101765 many towns have moved beyond npfh because its just not possible
1101766 we know they have done good work and there are good committed people behind those programs unfortunately theyre now tainted with this hypocrisy and leaves them unable to do their job in the manner they would like to do it
1101767 its not as if were against anti bias programs its just that if youre an anti bias program you cant engage in genocide denial and discriminate against armenians it contradicts npfhs entire mission
1101768 the bureau is adamant that the fact of the armenian genocide is not a subject of discussion and no high ranking official representing armenia may have a different approach universal recognition of the genocide is vital for the existence security and future of our people and statehood
1101769 for the arf bureau the goals and responsibilities of its international structure are the improving of the moral consciousness in armenia the strengthening of democratic standards the development of social stability the resolution of economic issues and ensuring the unity of armenia and diaspora
1101770 by fulfilling a demand of hrant dink who wished her to write a book on armenians
1101771 if hrant did not die no one would ask me when i met with hrant
1101772 akincis connection with armenians starts with kenan to whom he worked as a apprentice
1101773 the books names the sorts of writings that were kept waiting for decades
1101774 iran center for thought and speech for shaping the future of iran
1101775 we are not against the creation of such a commission but only if the border between our countries is opened
1101776 we are not against any study of even obvious facts and widely accepted realities
1101777 agreeing to a study does not mean casting doubt on the veracity of facts however the creation of such a commission would be logical only after the establishment of diplomatic relations and the opening of the border between our countries otherwise it could become a tool for dragging out and exploiting existing problems
1101778 it is strange that the genocide issue is being exploited by individuals who had done everything in the past to condemn that tragic page of our history to oblivion
1101779 genocide recognition by turkey will not lead to legal consequences for territorial claims
1101780 we have received the necessary explanation and clarification from the president
1101781 also the presidents spokesman and the foreign minister have publicly clarified that the presidents consent pertains to another kind of commission
1101782 in any case our approach is that there was no need to make such statements and create this confusion in the first place
1101783 i think that if the president of turkey visits yerevan at least one part of our society will express its attitude
1101784 as is known moscow has always been jealous about the prospect of a normalization of relations between yerevan and ankara
1101785 the kremlin has always managed to torpedo all initiatives aimed reopening the turkish armenian border fearing the loss of its influence in armenia however there have been suggestions lately that russian capital which is increasingly establishing itself in armenia is keen to use our country as a launch pad for occupying the vast turkish market that is moscow is not against an open border provided that border is under its control so maybe sarkisians proposal should be viewed in that context
1101786 i receive proposals from dahsnaks to find out what really happened if armenians are sincere it will be known soon i will not believe in serzh sargsyans sincerity unless armenians recognize territorial integrity of turkey and stop occupation of nagorno karabakh
1101787 proposals come not from armenia but from the west you know that armenias main diasporas reside in france and the u s we will see how sincere they are we approach sargsyans proposal in this context
1101788 if abdulla gul visits armenia we will announce a new symbolic start in our relations
1101789 whatever our differences there are certain cultural humanitarian and sports links that our peoples share even with a closed border
1101790 establishing normal political relations would enable us to create a commission to comprehensively discuss all complex issues affecting armenia and turkey only through them can we create an effective dialogue touching upon even the most contentious historical issues
1101791 there was suspicion among many in the arab world and among parts of the american public that the united states had gone to war in iraq precisely to secure the oil wealth these contracts seek to extract
1101792 to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of united states armed forces in iraq
1101793 to exercise united states control of the oil resources of iraq
1101794 contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional separation of powers
1101795 clearly supported prime minister maliki and the iraqi government against what they described as illegal armed groups of moktadas mahdi army in the recent conflict in basra
1101796 which is not surprising given that their main proxy in iraq the supreme iraqi islamic council dominates the iraqi state and is malikis main backer
1101797 because the u s and iran share the same proxy
1101798 stoking the three forces that have traditionally threatened the stability of middle eastern states tribalism warlordism and sectarianism
1101799 a strong centralised state ruled by a military junta that would resemble
1101800 was the first to officially agree to setting up the committee of historians that questions the recognition of the genocide
1101801 actually serge sargsyans stance towards armenian turkish relations has not changed
1101802 turkey proposed to set up a committee of historians to study all the facts we dont mind any investigation but the latter doesnt mean misrepresenting the real facts
1101803 we can speak about it only after the opening of armenian turkish border
1101804 the turkish side suggests to establish a commission which would study the historical facts we are not against it but only the condition of opening the armenia turkey border i plan of taking certain actions aiming at enhancing the relations between armenia and turkey most probably i shall invite president of turkey abdullah gul to yerevan in order to watch the football game between armenia and turkey
1101805 we are not against any studies even of widely accepted and obvious facts researching a fact does not mean doubting it
1101806 we closely watch the developments in karabakh where a new model of statehood is being formed the authorities enjoy public confidence and serious programs are being implemented
1101807 armenian genocide is an undisputable fact and the president knows that any official representing armenia cant have a different opinion the fact of genocide doesnt belong to the past but is an issue of security of our nation
1101808 i dont understand how a man who imposed blockade and set conditions to armenia can visit our country our party has exact position on the issue and we will never negotiate with him
1101809 were not talking about a banana republic were talking about one of the leading countries in the world this is the turkish republic im not in charge of this republic i dont represent this republic but i personally felt ashamed so i would love to see a little bit more seriousness in the follow up on this hrant dink case and if there is a link to ergenekon it has to be followed up there are serious accusations that there is a link between the ergenekon case and the hrant dink murder case
1101810 of course it is obvious that the sabiha g k en report played a crucial role in this context
1101811 does carnation loom again without fear does dove fly again in the city
1101812 i am like a dove like a dove i have my eyes everywhere in front of me at the back on the left on the right my head is as moving as the one of a dove and fast enough to turn in an instant
1101813 the russian turkish relations are improving against tensions between turkey and the u
1101814 the time has come for a fresh effort to break this deadlock a situation that helps no one and hurts many as president of armenia i take this opportunity to propose a fresh start a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey with the goal of normalizing relations and opening our common border
1101815 the time has come for a fresh effort to break this deadlock a situation that helps no one and hurts many as president of armenia i take this opportunity to propose a fresh start a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey with the goal of normalizing relations and opening our common border
1101816 we are heeding normalization concerning relations with armenia the armenian president has had certain statements resound in the international community
1101817 we have learned that he said that there is no other alternative than normalization of the two countries relations if this statement is so we agree with these suggestions as a matter of fact there had been exchange of letters right after the elections in armenia these elements are also in those letters accordingly if it the statement by sargsyan is true then we are responding with pleasure these statements by sargsyan
1101818 there is no real alternative to the establishment of normal relations between our countries it is my hope that both of our governments can pass through the threshold of this new open door we cannot expect tangible progress without such structured relations only through them can we create an effective dialogue touching upon even the most contentious historical issues
1101819 attacks on the armenian convoys and preventive measures taken by the government
1101820 special investigative commissions were formed in order to prosecute the officials accused of neglect of duty or illegal activities
1101821 government officials who were accused of wrongdoings and maltreating the armenians were prosecuted
1101822 they were taken to the military tribunals for severe punishment
1101823 trial and punishment of government officials at military tribunals charged with maltreating the armenians
1101824 government officials maltreating the armenians were prosecuted and punished including capital punishment
1101825 these documents show that there is information about punishment of government officials for maltreating the armenians
1101826 his death is immediately required otherwise he can cause us harm in the future
1101827 the abandoned properties commissions paid funds from the proceeds of the sold properties to the deportees the resettled refugees used these payments to start new businesses and quickly adapted to their new environment
1101828 monies paid to the armenians and about armenians using these monies to set up businesses in their new settlements
1101829 brother we paid you for your sold possessions when you resettled elsewhere now you have to pay back
1101830 armenians are paid 1 kurus piastre per adult and 20 para per child

1101837 he irregularly intervened in 1995 swinging the warship contract to the germans and compounded his improper behaviour in 1998 by intervening on behalf of thompson csf
1101838 the lack of communication over the future of the displaced foreign nationals has led to increased anxieties and fears in the camps
1101839 occidente trata de desviar a las mujeres de su papel principal y real en la sociedad presion ndolas con lemas vanos sobre libertad e igualdad
1101840 es uno de los errores m s grandes que prevalecen actualmente particularmente en las sociedades occidentales
1101841 los hombres tienen autoridad sobre las mujeres en virtud de la preferencia que al ha dado a unos m s que a otros y de los bienes que gastan las mujeres virtuosas son devotas y cuidan en ausencia de sus maridos de lo que al manda que cuiden amonestad a aqu llas de quienes tem is que se rebelen dejadlas solas en el lecho pegadles si os obedecen no os met is m s con ellas al es excelso grande
1101842 tomorrows meeting i think should literally be an effective meeting i think it should also be decisive
1101843 im truly excited and happy about my boys winning this tournament
1101844 it should be seen as a sign that the family is healing
1101845 the violence and torture central to bullfighting make it a truly shocking activity at any time but its cruelty is even more horrible when its being inflicted by a small child
1101846 this boy has killed nearly 60 of these animals in mexico theres video of him inflicting death on the web we decided to prevent him from fighting in france
1101847 what fans of corrida dont understand is the bloodshed and agony that draw them to the event is the same thing that repels the public once its forced to look at it
1101848 the raising and selling of bulls has played a large role in our economic social and cultural past and they still figure large in this seasonal festivity
1101849 its seen here by most people as an injustice and a mean spirited effort to impose one kind of thinking on attitudes and events rooted in tradition
1101850 aside from my family i have two great loves in my life acting and the fight for social justice
1101851 it is not productive to come out and attack leadership during a negotiation

1101901 the spring experiment is over and we are putting him back at linebacker
1101902 ive been there since my freshman year it was really like i took a vacation and came right back
1101903 i found out about it right before we started camp it was a couple days before camp but it was like we need somebody at linebacker so ill go back ill play whatever doesnt really matter im just here to help the team
1101904 strong safety and linebacker are kind of the same thing
1101905 im playing sam linebacker the concepts are really the same its just that sam plays up on the line of scrimmage but hes still out in space covering wide receivers and stuff like that
1101906 my man to man skills got better working with coach reed

1101939 beyond the final score the politics of sport in asia
1101940 it acknowledges that chinas rise is not a zero sum game thats not denying the competitive aspects to the relationship but it is a broader template which coincides with the building of the new embassy
1101941 the completion of the two new embassies not only reflects the good shape of our relationship but also signals broad prospects for its further growth

1101943 we werent talking about cursory stuff what kind of clothes to wear we were talking trial strategy

1101975 today it is much more reflective of the consensus of the american people
1101976 the court appears to have arrived at the worst of all possible outcomes it would be better to forbid the government to have religious symbols at all than to require that they be festooned with the trappings of modern american materialism
1101977 if there are to be religious symbols they should be treated with respect
1101978 what gets the respect of law professors regardless of their political leanings is that mcconnell is a scholar of enormous intellectual integrity

1101987 it undermines the president as leader of the party and of the armed forces and has implications for the running of the government and for the peace agreement signed with rebels from south sudan in 2005
1101988 we face a very difficult choice do we progress slowly with the project coming on stream in a few years time when hopefully the situation would be different or do we let it go to the zimbabwean government who will probably flip it to someone else for cash which they are not getting at the moment

1102152 and thats really unfair theres an enormous amount that happens after 25 or after 30 or after 40 some of which cant happen any earlier
1102153 the kind of milestones that we have associated with adulthood are happening later in the 20s

1102179 it has and will be funded by national making clear choices and having a clear sense of priorities

1102221 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza

1102293 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1102294 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that
1102295 need to make the point though that if a large number of retail investors more than normal do decide to leave we may be forced to close the a class as well but certainly hope thats not the case

1102321 we applied with the games organisers to order an extra long bed after the good luck beijing test events in april when all the clinical beds were just 2 1 meters long and very uncomfortable for taller patients
1102322 that really is the objective of the sunday kutcheri in the park to be able to provide a platform for such young children to display their musical talent
1102323 we chose to focus on young children as we believed it would help them shed their inhibitions and give them the confidence to move up to the next level children as young as 6 years have performed at the sunday kutcheri
1102324 the big challenge for us is the ambient noise this is a debate that has gone on now for 2 years sometimes people have said to me personally that we were being very ostrich like in forcing these children to sing without mikes and speakers that they couldnt be heard and that they couldnt do justice to their art
1102325 we have to be conscious and mindful of the fact that we operate in a public place
1102326 the fact is there are people who come to the park to do yoga meditate and to do a variety of things it would be presumptuous on our part to assume that all of them are lovers of carnatic music therefore the first thing we decided was no mikes no speakers we decided to do it in a confined space whereby those who are interested can come seeking this but we will not impose this on someone who doesnt necessarily want to be bothered by carnatic music
1102327 that is something we struggle with and is a compromise we have had to make
1102328 what is not apparent when people come to the park on the first sunday of every month is the background work that goes into making the kutcheri happen our senior colleagues take time off to sit through the audition rank these children and actually pick them to perform it is fairly demanding in terms of peoples time effort and passion
1102329 we have often found regular morning walkers at the park staying back after their walk to enjoy the kutcheri and to appreciate the young children over time the first sunday of every month has become a regular feature in the calendar of several of the morning walkers
1102330 the mikeless kutcheri is an interesting and innovative concept the children were initially surprised and a little tense when they were told that there would be no mikes and speakers but they enjoyed their first ever experience of a mikeless open air kutcheri
1102331 the sunday kutcheri in the park is a unique concept providing opportunities for talented young children from even the outskirts of chennai what surprised us was the big crowd early in the morning and that was a big boost to their confidence
1102332 for us living in the us its always the sabhas that come to mind when we think of music in chennai it was the first time we were introduced to a mikeless kutcheri and in an open air environment the audience was so close and almost sitting around us it was quite unique something we had not experienced earlier
1102333 i dont want to hype this more than what it is having said that it certainly is a platform for young children to showcase their musical talent children who first performed here have gone on to cut their own cd album one of the children who first sang at the sunday kutcheri was nominated for a prestigious young musician award that for us is very heartening those for whom we provided a platform blossoming and moving on that is the real return on investment for us
1102334 my learning through our experiment at the sundaram finance mylapore festival and the sunday kutcheri in the park is that actually more and more youngsters seem to be getting interested in classical art forms and music certainly is a large part of that if you look at the enthusiasm with which these children are learning and performing i wouldnt subscribe to the view which sometimes is expressed that music is dying out or that there is no appreciation of our culture i think that fear is a little ill founded
1102335 that is something we need to address but i wouldnt blame the children for lack of interest or lack of talent
1102336 over the last couple of years several people have suggested that we take the kutcheri in the park to other locations in chennai given our infrastructure and our limitations we picked nageswara rao park and carnatic music we believe that this park model can be replicated in fact we have had people from other locations visiting us to understand our model so they could replicate this in their own local parks we were quite pleased to hear that recently a couple of other parks in chennai have adopted this kutcheri in the park model this is indeed very gratifying
1102337 in the context of philanthropy it is said that the left hand ought not to know what the right hand has given i would apply more or less the same rule to csr our founder chairman sri t s santhanam believed that every company should give something back to the community the motivation therefore is anything but commercial if at all anyone talks about it it should be the beneficiaries
1102338 while we may be very passionate about our cause we cannot expect that the rest of the world will share that passion in fact the no mikes no speakers obsession stems from that belief

1102362 everybody is talking about the problem of global warming but i have a solution for it
1102363 bamboo acts as a carbon sink it absorbs excess co2 a greenhouse gas and cause of global warming in the air with three to four times more efficiency than any other tree which means the more bamboos we plant the more co2 is absorbed and thus we can stop contributing to global warming

1102394 these techniques are emerging and we need an ethical debate about the implications so that one day were not surprised and overwhelmed and caught on the wrong foot by what they can do these things are going to come to us in the next few years and we should really be prepared
1102395 we see the danger that this might become compulsory one day but we have to be aware that if we prohibit it we are also denying people who arent going to commit any crime the possibility of proving their innocence
1102396 do we want to become a minority report society where were preventing crimes that might not happen
1102397 for some of these techniques its just a matter of time
1102398 a lot of neuroscientists in the field are very cautious and say we cant talk about reading individuals minds and right now that is very true but were moving ahead so rapidly its not going to be that long before we will be able to tell whether someones making up a story or whether someone intended to do a crime with a certain degree of certainty
1102399 we shouldnt go overboard about the power of these techniques at the moment but what you can be absolutely sure of is that these will continue to roll out and we will have more and more ability to probe peoples intentions minds background thoughts hopes and emotions
1102400 some of that is extremely desirable because it will help with diagnosis education and so on but we need to be thinking the ethical issues through it adds a whole new gloss to personal medical data and how it might be used

1102437 shove a bunch of 30 second ads up mark udalls a
1102438 coloradans deserve to know if this is the kind of campaign bob schaffer is going to run obscene ugly attack politics that do nothing to deal with the challenges people are facing and frankly are just plain offensive
1102439 voters have made it clear this year that theyre sick and tired of this kind of thing but it looks like bob schaffer hasnt gotten the message we learned two things about bob schaffer this weekend that he is pledging to run negative ads between now and november and that his campaign is describing them with words that cant even run in the newspaper its time for bob schaffer to clean up the sleaze coming out of his campaign and start running a campaign worthy of the people of colorado
1102440 shove a bunch of 30 second ads up udalls a
1102441 were going to shove a bunch of 30 second ads up his a on this issue over the course of the campaign
1102442 poor bob schaffer just cant stop sabotaging his own campaign
1102443 we know this is a difficult time for wadhams august 11 is the two year anniversary of george allens macaca moment and the memory alone must be causing dick to break out in hives we can only assume that bob schaffers friends on the far right will be disappointed with his campaigns sleazy comments this sort of obscenity has no place in a campaign that should be about the issues
1102444 virtue and morality are necessary for the american experiment in democracy to work and it is the primary responsibility of parents to instill these values into their children as they grow into productive and contributing members of society
1102445 people who are worthy of our respect hold themselves to high moral standards in every area of their lives when the camera is not rolling and they are behind closed doors good people are faithful good people are kind to everyone not just their friends they know that wrong actions always hurt someone they know that wrong deeds diminish the doer as well

1102456 uribe is brazenly trying to take the power to investigate congressmen away from the one institution that has done the most to uncover and break paramilitary influence in the congress
1102457 this proposal serves no real purpose other than to help members of uribes coalition get off the hook
1102458 certainly the congressmen are entitled to due process but this proposal is far from necessary to secure those rights
1102459 the governments orwellian invocation of due process here appears primarily designed to mask an effort to undermine the parapolitics investigations
1102460 separate within the supreme court itself the functions of investigation and trial
1102461 the fact is individual prosecutors or lower court judges with less protection experience and visibility are far less likely to push the investigations of the congressmen forward than the supreme court which has a proven track record in these cases

1102470 well we havent had all star careers but weve all been pretty good pitchers throughout our careers
1102471 i mean its basically something that the media has really hopped onto the fact that were wash ups or were giveaways if you look behind it all weve all been pretty good pitchers
1102472 we knew full well that carpenter was going to be on the dl for at least three months and mulder was a question mark
1102473 and if you had ever said we were going to lose adam wainwright for 2 1 2 months i would have just said were in a lot of trouble
1102474 its a nice thing to have because this games hard and people get hurt
1102475 things dont always end up the way you think they do so the more you have of that ilk the better you are
1102476 the one thing that i emphasize and look for is a guy that will take the responsibility of being a starting pitcher
1102477 because if you dont take that responsibility youre going to shortcut you take shortcuts along the way youre not going to make the most of your abilities its a special thing to be a major league starting pitcher
1102478 they wouldnt be starting for this club if they didnt

1102482 i didnt really think i was ever going to turn into a fashion icon for a mustache to be honest with you
1102483 it started out as fun johnny damon and i would do things like this in oakland and we were both struggling and we talked about it we just kind of ran with it
1102484 we cant grow anything below the bottom lip so the next closest thing to do would be to grow a mustache its been humbling that the yankees organization has jumped on it
1102485 i always used to tease donnie because i grew up idolizing donnie with his mustache and when he was over here as a coach he shaved it off
1102486 its a tremendous honor for me to be a part of the phillies wall of fame with so many greats ex teammates and guys who i saw play when i was in the minor leagues who were part of that 1980 world series championship club
1102487 growing up in the dominican republic and finding myself here now is tremendous
1102488 one of the custom agents saw my passport and said oh yeah you played for the phillies
1102489 i said i played for the blue jays too people who know me know how much i loved the phillies and the fans in philly
1102490 a slave is a man that waits on another to set him free
1102491 the world baseball classic is very much related to our new baseball stadium
1102492 i think that mlb giving the marlins the second round shows that this market is seen as a gateway to latin america
1102493 its one example of what can come to miami as a result of the new stadium and the economic benefits that come with those events without the marlins here those sort of extra economic benefits would disappear
1102494 the world baseball classic is one of the great baseball tournaments around
1102495 when you get the best players from each country competing against each other you have many cities around the world paying close attention to those games
1102496 what hosting those games does is it brings an international taste to your city miami to me is the perfect example of a city that is an international melting pot it deserves to have that type of attention it really is an example of what can happen when you have a major league city in the absence of being a major league city these things do not happen
1102497 weve had very competitive teams here with two world series championships over the past decade
1102498 there is no question that we believe our attendance can and should be higher
1102499 there is such a huge supply of tickets at dolphin stadium that there is no urgency for advanced ticket buying
1102500 the second factor is climate you simply cant underestimate the impact summer weather has on our attendance youre talking about the threat of rain every day along with the heat and general discomfort
1102501 it causes people to stay home and watch on tv and listen to games on the radio thats exhibited this year again as we are in the top 10 in all ratings for major league baseball teams the series with the mets brought record local tv ratings while our attendance was good in the 20 000 each day of that series there is no question they would have been sellouts in the new stadium
1102502 the marketing and entertainment we provide it all combines to lead me to believe that we are a retractable roof stadium away from performing the way this market should
1102503 weve never believed that this was a small market its simply been a low revenue team what this new stadium will do it will better enable our revenue to reflect what it should be
1102504 the officers didnt treat her differently than anyone else kelly became really tearful and seemed incredibly embarrassed she was apologizing over and over again

1102506 in case youre a liberal and want to send freeman a get well note his address appears in section c of schedule a shown above
1102507 his background is ideally suited to turn around and unlock value in motorolas most trouble handset segment
1102508 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate a significant positive catalyst for mot shares
1102509 motorola scored a coup yet we do not expect that even the talented dr jha can have any substantial impact on motorolas roadmap until q4 2009 at the very earliest
1102510 a huge surprise to us and the street a very good choice to lead mot into the smart phone transition
1102511 motorola has made a great choice he is very well qualified to lead mobile devices back from the brink but he will need help especially in the areas of platforms and software we continue to prefer qualcomm over motorola but admit that things are getting interesting in chicago
1102512 a stunning win for motorola he is one of the stars of the wireless world
1102513 a strong choice sanjay not only adds technical expertise and strong carrier relationships but he also should help motorola attain and attract talent
1102514 a big win for motorola and a significant talent loss for qualcomm
1102515 bidz has found a sweet spot in an otherwise heavily beleaguered luxury retail industry
1102516 he has a relaxed feel to him but he has a passion for winning
1102517 hey havent heard from you and wanted to firm up the number of seats we need at the restaurant

1102519 because i havent heard from you i can only assume that you wont be coming
1102520 weak economic conditions aggressive promotional offerings by our competition the heavy marketing of hd service by our competition the growth of fiber based pay tv providers signal theft and other forms of fraud and operational inefficiencies at dish network
1102521 given the increasingly competitive nature of our industry it may not be possible to reduce churn without significantly increasing our spending on customer retention incentives which would have a negative effect on our earnings and free cash flow
1102522 our ability to maintain or grow our subscriber base will be adversely affected if we do not enter into a new agreement with at amp t and we are not able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels
1102523 as long as men can go topless women should have a same and equal right
1102524 otherwise men should also be forced to wear something that hides their chests
1102525 women who go topless in u s public places are currently arrested fined humiliated and treated as criminals
1102526 women should go topless and rally publicly in great numbers on august 23 to protest that despicable treatment and exercise their rights
1102527 we encourage all womens groups and individuals to join us at these rallies together with peaceful femininity but unshakable determination well protest this gross inequality in the law well demand that our right to go topless be recognized in accordance with the 14th amendment of the u s constitution and that all state laws be amended to reflect that right
1102528 will be delighted to assist you so you too can claim your constitutional right to be topless in public as a woman
1102529 all ive ever done was be juan pierre i dont know why for some reason theyre just sticking it to me this year
1102530 juan pierre reiterated sunday that this has been the toughest season of his career
1102531 increasingly concerned about the companys ability to hit expectations and drive margin expansion in the face of an eroding cdma revenue stream
1102532 at this point in our view the most redeeming thing about the stock is valuation
1102533 nonetheless were concerned about the companys ability to hit expectations particularly in light of sprint nextel weakness longer term cdma is also quite problematic given how profitable cdma is any meaningful hiccups create further downside
1102534 extremely disheartened by the significant year over year reduction in orders backlog and deferred revenue

1102545 satellite radio is obviously discretionary a clear headwind in a weakening economy

1102547 in the usual procedure vaginal examinations are performed numerous times during normal labor in the case of labor arrest or other complications the number of vaginal examinations increases
1102548 in the event of non progressive labor the diagnosis may be delayed thereby preventing the mother from obtaining the best medical care
1102549 in managing labor obstetricians are faced with a number of important challenges including identification of inadequate progress of labor and assessment of a quick developing labor process
1102550 the information available to the caregiver is inaccurate due to the objective nature of the measurement and intermittent assessment
1102551 you will have continuous information regarding the progress of labor and you will know the position of your baby every second

1102566 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
1102567 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep

1102569 hi im sorry to bother you guys but would mind not pouring water into the sandbox i know its a lot of fun but it makes the sandbox really disgusting and dirty and my son gravitates towards that of course and then i have to deal with it
1102570 researchers divided the medication deaths into four categories those that occurred at home and involved street drugs and or alcohol those that occurred at home and involved only medications those that occurred away from home and involved prescription drugs street drugs and alcohol and those that occurred away from home and involved only medications they were shocked to discover a more than fivefold increase in deaths that occurred in situations least likely to be supervised they logged a 564 percent spike in deaths from prescription drugs alone at home and a 555 percent rise in deaths away from home from the combination of prescription medications street drugs and or alcohol the smallest jump only about 5 percent was in medication errors that occurred away from home and did not involve street drugs or alcohol overall the number of fatal medication errors rose by 360 percent from 3 954 in 1983 to 22 770 in 2004 the study said all told more than 200 000 people died from accidental medication mistakes during that time
1102571 those highly addictive drugs have been a growing worry for years one reason theyre so dangerous is that the drugs slow down respiration sometimes substantially when a person takes too many drugs or combines them with other depressants such as alcohol breathing may stop entirely
1102572 there seems to be a mindset that medications are treated like other consumer goods
1102573 there is a substantial bid on the table and i think the board are contemplating that
1102574 there are one or two clubs who have expressed an interest in zheng zhi and i dont think it is fair on us or the clubs to name them
1102575 many complementary methods are extremely popular among cancer survivors who are spending a lot of their time money and attention on them
1102576 for this reason it is important to determine which are helpful not only for shrinking tumors and extending survival but also for relieving symptoms and improving quality of life
1102577 in general younger more educated and more affluent cancer survivors were more likely to use complementary methods
1102578 people with more advanced cancer were more likely to be complementary method users
1102579 this is not only because ovarian cancer is obviously limited to women and breast cancer is extremely rare among men for example all types of complementary methods were used more often by breast and ovarian cancer survivors than by uterine cancer survivors also women of course
1102580 scientific studies of complementary methods have become much more common during the past few years but there is still a lot of uncertainty about the effectiveness of many complementary methods
1102581 as more studies are done to evaluate effectiveness we will want to know whether men are missing opportunities to use some effective complementary methods that are far more popular in women or whether women use ineffective complementary methods more than men or whether some complementary methods are more effective for women than they are for men
1102582 this study like many before it confirms that cancer patients actively pursue a variety of alternative and complementary therapies usually in conjunction with standard approaches to cancer treatment
1102583 theres a lot of evidence to support the idea that when kids watch violent media they become more aggressive
1102584 and yet violent media has become easier and easier to access for children so for the movie industry the message is that the 1960s ratings system needs to be updated and made more explicit and relevant to the way movies are being distributed and seen today
1102585 but also parents need to be much more careful about how their children consume violent media
1102586 and in any case the american movie industry rates itself
1102587 so how and why some movies get an r rating while others dont isnt always rational because its like the fox watching the chicken coop and the industry is not going to do anything that limits it from getting as wide an audience as possible
1102588 theres quite a lot of validity to what these researchers are saying
1102589 children are definitely far more able to access this kind of violent material and its potentially worrying but the evidence isnt really there yet that theres a negative consequence

1102600 today with the current cash price of corn and the price of ethanol the plants are very close to breaking even or making a little money
1102601 ethanol producers who have been in the industry for a long time and have good risk management operations will be able to weather any times of challenging margins

1102604 kidd is clearly the third best point guard on the team chris paul and deron williams are significantly better players at this point in their careers so it makes sense that kidd even with his extensive international experience would get the fewest minutes of the floor leaders
1102605 should jason kidd be demoted as team usas starting point guard
1102606 cps effectiveness on the bounce is enhanced because of how his style contrasts with kidds

1102647 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they did not trust it anymore
1102648 there was a korean guy hanging upside down there was a second korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also and they were trying to survive but i had also to survive
1102649 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was

1102657 a well conceived api and set of tools for assisting and fixing the issues experienced in everyday web development
1102658 self concealing cabinet top presents an elegant solution to the dilemma of how to get the cabinet top out of view while preserving the swivel functionality of the motorized lift
1102659 on command the cabinet top conceals itself within the cabinetry behind the plasma or lcd tv while the flat screen rises and for additional functionality the self concealing cabinet top and the lift system are electronically linked for one command sequential operation
1102660 we always listen to what our customers ask of us
1102661 our original backplate option was introduced by lift tech as an alternative to the box within a box design this innovation gave rise to two different approaches to handling the cabinet top either raising it above the tv or in the case of up down lifts hinging the cabinet top so that it is for the most part concealed behind the backplate when the lift rises
1102662 what we ultimately designed is a functional aesthetically pleasing and safety oriented solution to meet all of the standards of our most discerning customers
1102663 as flat panel technologies and aesthetic requirements continue to evolve so do the accessories that have to meet or exceed the requirements set by the flat panel manufacturers
1102664 clearly we are not saying the powervault or any rgpc product is green
1102665 however if an rgpc dealer can sell a 25 000 power management device like powervault because the homeowner offsets a percentage of that cost with rebates or tax credits earned by installing a renewable energy system everyone benefits the dealer the homeowner and the planet

1102670 the perspective of the album is about living ones life bravely being unafraid of falling down and always getting back up
1102671 i had not known of a spirit to reincarnate and in this my disappointment has been grievous karma exists in the spirit world and many spirits of my association have become pure and perfected spirits through renunciation yet they have remained spirits and have progressed to the highest realms without taking another body
1102672 when comparing the most advanced mortals in mind and soul condition they are not equal to us in development this makes me wonder what improvement could be made in our condition in order for us to progress should we enter into another mortal body yet strangely we cling to our old belief in reincarnation and congregate together waiting for something that must happen in order for reincarnation to become the destiny of our souls
1102673 when i reached the spirit world i found such glory and happiness and beauty that i now realize this little earth is a grammar school not a university or even a high school it is only the first lesson of life
1102674 you can learn in one day here what takes years to learn on earth forget reincarnation because it is a sandbag around your neck you will have it so centered on your mind that you will think of nothing else and you will stay just where you are you cannot progress because your mind will always revert to the earth again you cannot live on the earth more than once life is progression not retrogression
1102675 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever
1102676 take the chair in front of us and try not to be nervous
1102677 what are all these spirits doing in the room get them out of here
1102678 you do this you do that this reading is over
1102679 he has this fantastic series called fear agent thats not by us but hes coming over to do another series equally as fantastic
1102680 its an elite u s combat team theyre not fighting terrorists theyre fighting supernatural beings
1102681 if you like telepathic fish monsters with fangs in the amazon jungle youll like spooks
1102682 the main character is john barret a very normal guy in his mid 20s or so works in new york city lives in new york city
1102683 and basically spends every waking hour working getting to work getting home from work really giving up all his hopes and dreams just to keep things going i think everyone here will understand what that feels like
1102684 what happens with john is that he becomes involved in a program thats testing a drug so you dont have to sleep anymore
1102685 now what it basically does is give extra time its the most valuable commodity there is in life and john is at a point in his life where he is beginning to realize that time is limited
1102686 thats the new way of movie development nowadays lets make a comic and turn it into a movie
1102687 thats always a possibility but we are never going to limit ourselves to movies or tv or digital short i say we just make a series of commercials
1102688 i am very proud of my very early commercial work and i want to put this on my reel
1102689 the show that i work on heroes we pretty much got our successes here at comic con
1102690 for me its about being accepted into the community and understanding that this isnt vanity this isnt more anything than just wanting to make a great comic and contribute to the world that actually did give me a great deal of enjoyment growing up
1102691 its definitely a big part of the evolution that john goes through
1102692 if you cant sleep you cant dream if you cant dream what are you living your life for
1102693 as the series goes on we are kind of blurring the line between what is real and what isnt whats in the real world and whats in the dream
1102694 no no its okay im just not ready to do that
1102695 im so uncomfortable because its you i wouldnt be this uncomforable with other girls
1102696 richard ran an expedition and as joint leader and main operator of the practical side he felt that he had a right to loyalty from the expedition members inevitably that meant agreement with him on all important factors associated with the expedition in fact i suspect that it was the only way such an expedition can be run glynns democractically run side of the expedition was always chaotic and badly organized richards way has its weaknesses if you did not agree on important issues you could either back down or leave most of us backed down for a few times and then eventually left despite this my own preference would be to work for an expedition run by richard

1102703 theres nobody on my staff who would still be working for me if they made a comment like that about anybody of any ethnic group and i would hope that nbc ends up having that same attitude
1102704 a few months after he received his final payment from eki obama sent a request on state senate letterhead urging illinois officials to provide a 50 000 tourism promotion grant to another blackwell company killerspin
1102705 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1102706 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider

1102714 do you personally have any regrets about what you did campaigning for your wife
1102715 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about
1102716 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1102717 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked him obama personally
1102718 you know i am sorry if anyone was offended it was certainly not meant in any way to be offensive
1102719 yeah that may be by the time he got through working on it that was probably true
1102720 you know he hit her hard a couple of times and they hit us a few times a week before she ever responded in kind the only thing i ever got mad about was people in your line of work pretending that she somehow started the negative stuff its a contact sport
1102721 we had a hard fought primary we head to the fall a united democratic party and look forward to the general election
1102722 im concerned that if he returns he will continue in the actions that bring us here today
1102723 he is not a threat and he is not a flight risk
1102724 total opera full of anger disgust great music that has rarely sounded so fresh and the far from simple joys of being alive absolutely unmissable

1102727 into the wild is very cool with a unique look at the great fairytale characters i couldnt put it down until i knew how this brave extraordinary girl could face such powerful magic
1102728 sarah beth dursts into the wild is fabulous in the oldest truest and best sense of the word harking back to fables wonder and magic unleashed its bold sassy and utterly engaging i cant wait to see what she does next
1102729 into the wilds fairy tale characters are fascinating and julie is everything one could want in a heroine shes intelligent practical determined and brave at once more ordinary and more extraordinary than she herself thinks she is ill be keeping an eye out for more work from sarah beth durst
1102730 an amazing wild ride with very high stakes and the fate of humans and fairytale people alike on the shoulders of one determined girl this is even better than the first book
1102731 this is one of those rare occasions when the sequel is as good as the first book if not better though in my estimation they make two halves of one story and what a wonderfully entertaining story it is
1102732 head spinning fun any book that mixes fire breathing dragons and elvis presley is a rare treat
1102733 these are the same people using the same tactics that brought us george w bush and look what a disaster he is
1102734 for the last 8 years bush with mccains support have lost the respect of our allies wont it be great and powerful to regain that respect so the us does not have to go it alone
1102735 for the last 8 years americans have been ashamed of its leaders wont it be great to have a leader again that has won the respect of both world leaders and the people they represent
1102736 this is the support we had after 9 11 and then bush with mccains support squandered it to john mccain it is a big joke something to mock and hes spending millions of dollars to belittle me this time when you vote vote as if your whole world depended on it because it does
1102737 theres a good reason john mccain does not draw large enthusiastic crowds he has nothing to say that george bush has not been saying and he does not know what he is talking about when he does
1102738 john mccain claims to have experience but has it been useful he didnt know you were hurting economically he didnt even understand who the enemy is in iraq he still has not apologized to the american people for promoting and voting for the war in iraq
1102739 john mccain brought to you by the same people who brought you george bush
1102740 barack obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
1102741 we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
1102742 some obama backers are right to worry the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
1102743 these types of campaigns which the media often helps todrive as it analyses the effectiveness of the attacks before questioning the accuracy of theinformation will continue from now until election day on november 4
1102744 and its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
1102745 there is some evidence that the balance of enthusiasm has shifted and that young people who seemed to turn out and vote for senator obama in unusually high numbers in the primaries and caucuses are no longer so enthusiastic about him
1102746 i think they are cynical and want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1102747 im young im new to the national scene my name is barack obama im african american i was born in hawaii i spent time in indonesia

1102865 our record level of revenue and good cost control led to strong operating margins for the quarter
1102866 the outlook for each of our business segments continues to improve as the year progresses despite coming off historical highs oil prices are well above the level required by our customers to aggressively seek opportunities to increase production and add to their reserves near term weakness in gas prices should be short lived and offset by increased activity in the haynesville shale play where we have had a substantial presence for years our internal growth initiatives in the barnett shale and the expansion of our dominant market position in the permian basin which also includes the growing gas drilling activity in the ft stockton area in conjunction with this enhanced activity we are beginning to experience an increase in pricing and utilization making us optimistic for improved results as we progress through the remainder of 2008
1102867 our solid results this quarter were driven by a strong ramp in sales of our products to emerging markets such as south america russia and india coupled with a lower than expected average selling price erosion during the quarter
1102868 we began the product upgrade from the series 9 to the series 11 chipset for the mainstream segment and reached the shipment milestone of 100 000 units per month in this new product category during the quarter

1102974 im interested in the ways in which we can interpret as a sort of hybrid amalgamation of
1102975 walaupun berhadapan dengan kenaikan harga minyak yang tinggi kenaikan cukai jalan atau perbuatan mengekori kereta lain pada jarak dekat menyalahgunakan telefon serta memonopoli laluan tengah namun rata rata pemandu masih tidak boleh membayangkan hidup tanpa berkereta kata presiden aa edmund king
1102976 mesej yang ingin disampaikan kepada kerajaan dan pihak berkuasa tempatan ialah kita perlu belajar untuk hidup dengan berkereta daripada mengehadkan penggunaan kereta katanya
1102977 langkah ini selaras dengan keputusan jawatankuasa pengurusan parti supaya perjalanan mesyuarat cawangan dan bahagian serta kempen diawasi oleh ibu pejabat umno
1102978 setiap ahli politik ada masa turun dan naiknya apa yang penting bagi saya ialah apa yang dibuat untuk rakyat dan negara
1102979 ya saya memang orang permatang pauh dan memang banyak pertanyaan supaya saya menjadi calon di permatang pauh tetapi saya tidak minat
1102980 cukuplah bagi pada orang politik lainlah saya tidak mahu tambah kekusutan politik yang ada lagi pun ini politik bukan medan saya
1102981 yang penting bagi anwar ialah beliau mesti meningkatkan majoritinya majoritinya tidak boleh kurang daripada apa yang diperoleh oleh isterinya sebelum ini jika sebaliknya berlaku tidak tahulah
1102982 pilihan ini akan mengelakkan perpecahan memastikan terdapat perubahan kepimpinan dan parti tidak dibelenggu dengan soal calon dan mencalon pemimpin
1102983 saya akan mencapai usia 65 tahun tidak lama lagi pada 4 november 2008 walaupun saya masih kuat dan aktif dalam semua erti kata saya lebih cenderung pergerakan ini diketuai oleh wanita yang lebih muda
1102984 pertandingan itu kelak pasti sengit dan akan berlaku perkara yang melemahkan pergerakan termasuk fitnah memfitnah berpuak puak dan perpaduan akan tercabar
1102985 jangan pula ada orang bertanya betulkah rafidah nak lepaskan jawatan pada pertengahan 2009 boleh percayakah saya ialah orang yang kata dikotakan saya tak pandai bermuka muka
1102986 saya tidak hendak wanita umno berpecah belah saya tiada benda nak diserahkan jawatan saya ketua sahaja saya hendak serah cepat jawatan supaya proses pemulihan cepat berlaku

1102994 if at any time you are outdoors and experience shortness of breath or excessive coughing or wheezing go inside immediately and take appropriate action
1102995 dont assume face masks are going to solve the problem
1102996 while n95 face masks may provide some benefit most commercially available air masks were not designed to protect against all forms of air pollution for example they dont protect against gases like ozone smog which will be one of the important components of the air in beijing
1102997 the beijing olympics calls the worlds attention to the seriousness of air pollution that focus needs to continue long after the games end
1102998 decades of hard work tackling air pollution in the united states mean that we no longer have beijing levels of air pollution but even our problem isnt solved we still have too many americans breathing dangerous sometimes fatal air pollution in their own backyards

1103004 i would like to say that several months ago in detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged veterans testified to war crimes committed in southeast asia they told stories that at times they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in a fashion reminiscent of genghis khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country

1103028 im not called to preach so please give a warm welcome to my awesome highly caffeinated pastor matt fry
1103029 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1103030 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1103031 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1103032 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1103033 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1103034 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1103035 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1103036 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1103037 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1103038 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1103041 it would be very cruel to say that what we have ended up with is a twilight home in east belfast for retired gunmen but are relations today between the communities really that different
1103042 im just not convinced that the outcome we do have is any better than what we wouldve had had the march not went ahead
1103043 the thought that this would lead to a re emergence of militant irish nationalism which would in turn bring about the resurgence of militant loyalism would simply never even have occurred to us
1103044 what this was about and what it has returned to was equality of citizenship history will record the provisional iras campaign as a continuation of the civil rights movement by inappropriate means
1103045 between the pomposity of bew and the extravagance of mccann i might look like the sane one
1103046 there can be no viler act apart from homosexuality and sodomy than sexually abusing children
1103047 a new duty will be placed on local authorities to promote democracy local leaders will be expected to do more to help residents understand how the democratic process works and how they can get involved residents can expect to see information campaigns and town halls being opened up to councillors to hold surgeries new civic champions council staff or former councillors who will go out into the community and work with residents and community groups to increase understanding about how they can raise awareness about civic roles they can take up whether thats volunteering standing as a governor a councillor or becoming a magistrate
1103048 in our own informal way weve acted more as a critical friend than fawning acolyte or jaded oppositionalist
1103049 wed like to highlight the good things that are happening right now in northern ireland and the awards will aim to reward effort and interactivity with a pat on the back from the blogosphere
1103050 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
1103051 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
1103052 addiction shouldnt be an unsolvable problem if methadone is ever used as an anti cancer therapy

1103133 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
1103134 were investing in any project that we have ready for funding we do that first then the money thats earned in our business is the shareholders money and we return it to the shareholders
1103135 these oil companies cannot continue to earn these profits spend a pittance on renewable fuels to move america beyond oil and then block any efforts to shift billions in tax breaks to companies trying to bring about the next generation of clean energy
1103136 yes the oil companies are making some big profits when theyre not spending it to look for oil theyre paying it for dividends and who gets those dividends i suspect theyre americans americans who invest in pension funds
1103137 the most striking thing about chevrons report was its executives webcast discussion of its available new oil and its progress or lack of it in producing that oil
1103138 its most immediate project is a nigerian oilfield expected to turn a handsome profit as one executive acknowledged while costlier projects in the gulf of mexico merited only vague predictions
1103139 these economic choices show the pointlessness of president bushs demand that currently off limits coastal areas be handed on a platter to oil companies while known large discoveries in the gulf of mexico go undrilled
1103140 the drill now drill everywhere campaign is a hoax on americans
1103141 chevrons laggard production of u s based oil shows a company intent on assuring the highest profit from top quality nigerian oil while costlier u s production takes a back seat
1103142 later when chevrons new nigerian production is hampered by political violence itll be another excuse for traders to jack up the price of crude oil
1103143 drivers arent sentimental about buying gasoline theyre screaming in pain
1103144 if chevron thinks californians have a choice about cutting back multimillion dollar executive salaries have addled its judgment
1103145 in a normal market with prices for a product rising like they have for oil manufacturers in competitive markets would be spending like crazy to make more of it
1103146 yet oil companies are able to sit back and make more money by selling less even if both u s coasts and the alaska wilderness preserve were handed to them theyd demand more tax breaks before hiring the first drilling rig
1103147 experience with the hamilton khaki below zero chronograph watch reveals a fatal flaw

1103149 when we handle something fragrant our hands retain the perfume to whatever they touch let our prayers pass through the hands of the holy virgin as her holiness and purity will perfume them whild presenting them to god
1103150 you cannot please both god and the world at the same time they are utterly opposed to each other in their thoughts their desires and their actions you either belong wholly to the world or wholly to god
1103151 the israeli government has neither any direct knowledge nor any comment on this incident
1103152 i was forced to defend myself against relentless attacks from self appointed fighters for justice who sought to depose me from my position when the ends sanctified all the means
1103153 he wishes him well and will continue to work closely with him while he remains prime minister
1103154 its true that olmert was enthusiastic about the peace process and he spoke about this process with great attention but it has not achieved any progress or breakthrough
1103155 his speech was open and direct and im sure he is relieved now it is time to establish an alternative leadership in the party
1103156 no court civilian or military has credibility when it listens to secret evidence in a closed courtroom
1103157 is not ideal since it deprives the public of being able to make up its own mind about guilt or innocence
1103158 it is to be expected given the nature of the proceedings
1103159 its everybodys desire for the trials to be as open as possible
1103160 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
1103161 women were hurt as men started to run and flee inside police vehicles i saw flesh dead bodies and blood the protesters went crazy hitting nearby buildings with bullets shoes and rocks
1103162 the explosion was huge stronger than the rockets we usually hear
1103163 people were confused running in all directions many people were thrown on the ground
1103164 clearly when you make a pledge you ought to fulfill it
1103165 the one thing i find hard to explain is why they dont contribute more financially
1103166 most of them make the pledges reluctantly on the basis that the united states wanted them to do it
1103167 there is frustration that nothing is happening in the peace process and so they would be throwing good money after bad
1103168 saudi arabia has historically lived up to its commitments to support the palestinians and will continue to do so
1103169 allegations that saudi arabia has not lived up to its commitments are not correct
1103170 the uae is meeting all commitments for financial aid that were made to the palestinian authority
1103171 in direct and in kind financial aid through multiple channels
1103172 there are inherent limits to refugee processing capacity in the region that would not accommodate the substantially higher resettlement numbers you are proposing
1103173 most of these have left or are in the process of leaving the country and face an urgent need of assistance and protection as their resources run out
1103174 we see real potential to resettle iraqis associated with the united states through our nascent in country program
1103175 formidable logistical and security challenges must be overcome in baghdad
1103176 its terrible that we cant walk outside without being in danger
1103177 if they had ruined his house or deported his family maybe this man would have thought twice about what he did
1103178 a reminder of what israelis have courageously lived with on a daily basis for far too long
1103179 i strongly condemn this attack and will always support israel in confronting terrorism and pursuing lasting peace and security
1103180 when you engage with reporters from 8 30 a m till 8 at night youre bound to make a gaffe
1103181 people are yearning for the kind of president who takes tough questions and thats who john mccain is
1103182 id encourage anyone who has concerns about john mccains age to join him on the campaign trail he keeps an exhausting schedule often visiting two or three states a day answering dozens of questions from voters and the media along the way
1103183 the media is in love with barack obama if it wasnt so serious it would be funny
1103184 gaffe after gaffe after gaffe come from john mccain and they are forgotten there is no way barack obama would be able to get away with something like this
1103185 mccains mistakes raise a serious if uncomfortable question are the gaffes the result of his age and what could that mean in the oval office
1103186 people wonder if mccain is kind of like a pitcher seven or eight years past his prime and misses a few here and there
1103187 when youre about to turn 72 people are going to be watching to see if youre slipping
1103188 this is a disgusting decision on the part of the army command
1103189 there will be games that will be enhanced by the wii motionplus as well as games that can only be played with it
1103190 users will need four if they have four controllers but were going to try to offer it for as little as possible we havent announced the price yet but the cost of making the wii motionplus is not that much so i think we can make it very affordable
1103191 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1103192 the hardware team started work on the next thing as soon as they were done with their previous project but what they think up doesnt necessarily become a product
1103193 we only turn something into a product after its been thoroughly vetted inside the company were not at a point where we can give specifics but of course were working on it
1103194 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1103195 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1103196 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1103197 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1103198 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1103199 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1103200 we cant give any schedules or dates but the iraqi government sees the suitable date for withdrawal of the u s forces is by the end of 2010
1103201 we dont think that talking about specific negotiating tactics or your negotiating position in the press is the best way to negotiate a deal
1103202 senator barack obama is a candidate and we are talking to the administration which is in power
1103203 it will not have any discussion about troop levels the next commander in chief is going to have to make those decisions
1103204 in other cities a police officer whos shot 11 suspects and killed five of them might be called a menace or a vigilante
1103205 lets face it if you are writing a fantasy story about a talking hammer and its unwilling companion it cant really be anything but humorous
1103206 first memory of my mother the time she let me get high at a concert when i was four and then i ate stale popcorn for three hours off the floor of the venue while she danced like a hippie greatest day of my life
1103207 end of the world market failure du jour 1999 y2k problem
1103208 why are we allowing people to tell them try it you might like it over 70 percent of young kids 13 to 24 years old men having sex with men are now hiv positive

1103210 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1103211 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1103212 his decision leaves in doubt a proposal by mccain for a series of town hall style matchups the first commission sponsored debate is set for sept 26 there would also be one vice presidential debate
1103213 only a miracle in the next 24 hours is going to keep glasgow university at the crichton campus in dumfries
1103214 the snp have to be given full credit for following through on their election promise to keep it open
1103215 when ahmadinejad was elected in 2005 there were some who argued that the reformist experiment had been an exercise in wishful thinking that had not reflected the reality of iran and that with ahmadinejads election the real raw iran had finally come to the foreground
1103216 israeli archaeologists have unearthed a seal impression belonging to a minister of the biblical king zedekiah which dates back 2 600 years during an archeological dig in jerusalems ancient city of david
1103217 the seal impression or bulla with the name gedalyahu ben pashur who served as minister to king zedekiah 597 586 bce according to the book of jeremiah was found completely intact just meters away from a separate seal impression of another of zedekias ministers yehukual ben shelemyahu which was unearthed three years ago
1103218 both ministers are mentioned in the book of jeremiah jeremiah 38 1 4 along with two other ministers when they came to king zedekiah demanding the death of the prophet jeremiah for preaching to the besieged city to surrender
1103219 over the past few days more than 1000 bangladeshis have been deported from kuwait officials at dhaka airport told reporters with hundreds more facing a similar fate
1103220 nearly 170 bangladesh workers returned home from kuwait on friday complaining they had been beaten and expelled after taking part in a rare labour protest in the gulf state
1103221 some bangladeshis returning on friday said they had been beaten and kept in appalling conditions after being accused of taking part in the protests
1103222 the army beat us mercilessly while breaking up the protest and also in detention camps said mohammad ilyas 28 who started work in kuwait three years ago after selling everything he owned and borrowing from relatives to afford the agent fees
1103223 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
1103224 were investing in any project that we have ready for funding we do that first then the money thats earned in our business is the shareholders money and we return it to the shareholders
1103225 these oil companies cannot continue to earn these profits spend a pittance on renewable fuels to move america beyond oil and then block any efforts to shift billions in tax breaks to companies trying to bring about the next generation of clean energy
1103226 yes the oil companies are making some big profits when theyre not spending it to look for oil theyre paying it for dividends and who gets those dividends i suspect theyre americans americans who invest in pension funds

1103228 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
1103229 consumers and government deserve a truer picture of where their hard earned gasoline and heating oil dollars are disappearing to
1103230 its oil production continues to drop even after excluding political disruptions of supply exxon wont take the risks or spend the money to produce new energy even in areas where it already has made deals or obtained rights
1103231 in a normal market with prices for a product rising like they have for oil manufacturers would be spending like crazy to make more of it
1103232 yet oil companies including exxon would rather sit back and make more money by selling less even if both u s coasts and the alaska wilderness preserve were handed to them theyd just demand more tax breaks and not drill
1103233 oil companies are spiting the future for the sake of cash in hand
1103234 the companies quarterly reports are a testament to management whose sole focus is short term profits not a long term energy future
1103235 success is boring success is proving that you can do something that you already know you can do failure is how we learn

1103259 themarkets com is looking forward to expanding the group of contributors we serve through our unique broker friendly services
1103260 we already have in place a pain free feed integration process to get new contributors up and running as quickly as possible i look forward through this new role to expanding the benefits of our system to additional contributors
1103261 from its inception themarkets com has been an important member of rixml org and an active contributor in advancing our research standard making it an ideal choice for brokers seeking a leading research distribution partner
1103262 our entitlements system provides the flexibility and transparency the contributor community has been asking for
1103263 through our system contributors can completely manage which clients have access to which content and this enables themarkets com to better serve our buy side clients by delivering premium content such as earnings models in excel via a fully entitlement compliant online platform
1103264 dave has been a significant contributor to themarkets com since our founding we are delighted that he has stepped up once again to a large new leadership role in our service to our broker partners he and his team will guide our efforts as we continue to lead the industry in building and enhancing broker tools that significantly exceed standards for tagging entitlements control and other broker requirements while we work to establish direct relationships with content providers
1103265 for the third quarter in a row we reported double digit revenue gains we are also pleased with the improvement in gross margins during the second quarter while revenue from our fitness management segment was essentially flat we were able to replace the revenue lost from contract cancellations that occurred during the first six months of 2007 our health management segment continued to experience double digit growth with the second quarter resulting in new customer commitments and expansion of existing customers
1103266 at the same time we have not been immune from the challenging economy which has lengthened sales cycles and delayed some customer commitments
1103267 to counteract longer customer evaluation periods we are refining our health management sales approach to focus on our unique value proposition and ability to reduce costs during the first year of a customer engagement for the interim i have taken a more direct managerial role within our sales organization to oversee this important work and to ensure that we are maximizing our sales opportunities we believe that by focusing on lowering employers direct and indirect health care costs coupled with a solution based sales approach we can better cultivate existing and upcoming rfps and grow the number of customer commitments
1103268 for the first six months of 2008 we have received a total of 51 health management and 16 fitness management rfps which is comparable to the number we received halfway through 2007 despite the challenging economy a number of these rfps have developed into an active sales pipeline that includes an above average number of potential opportunities as we enter the last half of 2008 we are confident in the strength of our service offerings our ability to secure new customer commitments and the continued growth of our health management segment which drives the opportunity to improve operating margins

1103292 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1103339 our operations performed remarkably well during the quarter and compared favorably to first quarter we have implemented additional price increases to offset the substantial impact of inflation on our raw materials and freight costs the charleston operation which joined our company on july l 2008 represents an important step in achieving our strategic vision our meetings last month with our new charleston employees were well received and filled with enthusiasm we look forward to realizing the potential of our expanding company
1103340 our strong second quarter revenue growth and gross profit improvement demonstrate measurable progress toward our near term goals of attaining positive cash flow and profitability
1103341 our growth was widespread both geographically and across multiple product segments demonstrating the expanding market acceptance of the ats brand we were especially pleased with growth in the united states which is maintaining its positive momentum as a result of several new product introductions and growing brand awareness
1103342 our second quarter revenue growth was especially strong due to increasing contributions from our non mechanical valve products
1103343 while we continue to grow revenue from our core mechanical valve line our non mechanical valve revenue grew approximately 153 over the second quarter of 2007 even without contributions from our tissue valve in the united states we believe our recently launched products and strong product pipeline will enable us to continue growing record revenue in 2008 and beyond
1103344 we are pleased with the companys performance particularly in this economic environment which has been so challenging for many of our largest advertisers
1103345 while our display advertising has been relatively soft the other components of our business such as cpc deposits insurance retirement and credit cards are all doing very well
1103346 over the past couple of years weve been focused on diversifying our business through growth internal development and acquisitions and are now seeing that strategy paying off in a tough market

1103359 our top line performance was very good as many of our key products showed strong year over year growth in both dollars and units as expected our margins were negatively affected by rising commodity and energy costs but pricing plans put into place during the second quarter will help to drive margin growth over the second half of the year we were especially pleased with the results from our new e d smith acquisition where sales volume grew by 7 0 from last year
1103360 although we saw margin erosion in the second quarter this was due to the timing of our price increases and the sudden surge in the energy costs during the second quarter
1103361 we will see more pricing materialize in the third and fourth quarters as we ship our winter season products like soup and non dairy creamer we expect third quarter earnings excluding unusual items to be in the range of 0 37 to 0 40 and are reaffirming our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of 1 50 to 1 55 before unusual items
1103362 bluephoenix continues to deliver consistent year over year improvements in revenue demonstrating the strong ongoing demand for our expertise and solutions
1103363 we enter the second half of the year with the strongest near term pipeline in our companys history both in terms of the number of deals and the aggregate revenue opportunity in addition to a backlog that exceeds 100 million though our growth in 2008 thus far has been slowed somewhat by sporadic delays in the closing of deals and impacted our short term visibility we are benefiting from a 60 recurring revenue base and this robust and growing pipeline the demand for data modernizations and migrations is intact and our best of breed tools and solutions are well positioned for sustainable long term success
1103364 the gradual weakening of the dollar in the past 12 months has had substantial impact on our operating expenses and p amp l this year
1103365 the shekels 20 appreciation against the u s dollar from june 30 2007 to june 30 2008 has been a partial offset to our bottom line growth this year
1103366 we believe that our backlog and pipeline for new business will enable us to continue growing our revenues at a rate of approximately 20 per year accordingly we are expecting revenue for 2008 of 92 million to 97 million taking into account the effect of the currency exchange rate the growth in services as part of our revenue mix and our ability to close deals directly ahead of us we are forecasting our non gaap earnings per share for 2008 to be in a range of 0 55 and 0 70 the wide range in this forecast reflects our more tenuous view as to timings of near term revenue recognition primarily based on longer sales cycles in our business legacy migration tools remain in high demand and our long term prospects remain excellent

1103395 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1103396 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers

1103418 the results actually show that when you take the number of research grants the university attracts and divide it by the number of research staff the university gets a five star rating for their research grant success

1103425 i welcome it if they are going to stay but unless they are quarantined as maternity beds and the community are made aware that those beds are there to use im not sure that the situation is going to be any different

1103430 very early in the process senators dole and burr helped lead the effort to ensure the harmful medicare regulation highly detrimental to the health care needs of north carolina seniors would not go into effect
1103431 senators dole and burr helped make sure the administration was aware of the impending funding cuts for north carolina medicare beneficiaries and were among the very first senators to co sign a letter to health and human services hhs secretary mike leavitt
1103432 jeopardize the significant quality improvements made by the skilled nursing facility snf community in recent years as well as the ability of snfs to continue caring for high acuity patients because snfs rely on medicare to make up for chronic underfunding by the medicaid program an average of 13 per day for every medicaid beneficiary in nursing homes nationwide it is critically important that medicare reimbursement remain fair and consistent we believe that if the administration were to finalize its proposed rule the ability of providers to care for our nations most vulnerable population the frail elderly and disabled would be severely threatened
1103433 from a health policy standpoint the cancellation of the medicare regulation last week is an outstanding development in terms of both meeting seniors changing health care needs and doing so in a manner that uses medicare funds efficiently senators dole and burr deserve enormous credit for working in an intelligent bipartisan manner to help achieve a result highly beneficial to every north carolina medicare beneficiary

1103443 we believe that the benefit to patients clinicians and hospitals of our life saving masimo set and masimo rainbow set technologies continue to create momentum for the adoption of our products despite the generally difficult economic environment we believe our business model continues to resonate with hospitals who demand the best technology for their patients in addition after a strong first quarter we are pleased that sales of our rainbow set products have continued to gain momentum and set a new record in the second quarter of 2008
1103444 improving patient outcomes and reducing cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications
1103445 the economic environment we operated in during the second quarter was very difficult because of reduced demand and increased costs but we were able to maintain adjusted ebitda at a level comparable to last years second quarter
1103446 despite the difficult sales environment our products continue to be among the best performing at retail our year over year sales performance exceeded that reported by the international sleep products association for the tenth consecutive quarter although our domestic segment sales declined for the quarter
1103447 our operating results continue to be negatively impacted by rising raw material and fuel prices to mitigate raw material cost inflation during the quarter we successfully executed on significant cost reduction efforts and we implemented a price increase on our products at last weeks las vegas market we successfully introduced our new beautyrest studio tm line to provide our customers with an improved beautyrest r product offering at introductory price points we believe this line will help capture a younger generation of beautyrest r customers as well as those price conscious consumers trading down as a result of the current economy

1103458 in response to the weakness in the economy we first attempted to drive incremental profitable revenue through increased promotional activity in the first and second quarters which proved unsuccessful therefore in addition to the staffing adjustments we began curtailing promotional spending in the third quarter and we plan to make more significant reductions beginning in the fourth quarter compared to second quarter levels these operating and marketing initiatives will better align our costs with current consumer spending trends which we expect will ultimately improve our margins going forward we believe we can successfully manage our cost structure without compromising on the high quality guest experience for which ameristar has long been known
1103459 we expect current difficult business conditions to continue at least through the second half of 2008 reflecting the impact of the general economic slowdown and higher fuel prices on the gaming industry
1103460 ameristar remains focused on delivering the highest quality guest experience in our markets while diligently seeking to maximize profitability our efforts to adjust our workforce and promotional spending to obtain greater efficiencies combined with the capital investments we have made should position us well to capture additional growth again once the economy starts to rebound

1103469 it takes a big man to make a pure vodka
1103470 if russian citizens express their confidence in dmitry medvedev and elect him as the countrys president i will be ready to head the government
1103471 we shouldnt be ashamed or afraid of transferring the key powers of the country the destiny of russia to the hands of such a man
1103472 theyre talking tough and saying the west has taken advantage of us in the last 50 years and theyre offering a better deal they are ready to beat the chinese the indians and the americans
1103473 hes not a good guy but hes done extraordinary things
1103474 hes a new tsar of russia and hes dangerous in the sense that he doesnt care about civil liberties he doesnt care about free speech he cares about stability but stability is what russia needed and thats why russians adore him
1103475 i can tell you from my own experience that a colossal number of correspondents from western publications started calling me just in the last week to ask me what i think of this
1103476 that putin controls 37 percent of the stock in surgutneftegaz 4 5 percent of the gazprom stock and 75 percent of the stock in the gunvor company
1103477 i should remind you that the gunvor company with capitalization estimated at 15 20 billion now sells a huge amount of russian oil including the oil belonging to yuganskneftegaz
1103478 i should also remind you that khodorkovskiy was once accused of minimizing his taxes by selling oil from a company he owned through offshore firms also owned by him this was called a crime
1103479 obviously if you calculate the price at which the rosneft state company must have been selling oil to the non state gunvor offshore company for it to amass capitalization of 15 20 billion and i have never heard that any of khodorkovskiys offshore firms had capitalization approaching this figure you have to wonder if what khodorkovskiy was doing moving money from one of his own pockets into another of his pockets is a crime then what would you call what people are doing when they move money from the states pocket namely the rosneft company to a private pocket namely the gunvor company
1103480 gennadiy timchenko is believed to own 50 percent of the stock in the gunvor company
1103481 going back to belkovskiys statements i certainly cannot imagine how he could prove them and i seriously doubt that anyone ever will be able to prove that the figure of 40 billion is correct
1103482 i think it would also be impossible to prove that putin is the actual beneficiary of the gunvor company or any other company just as it would be impossible to prove that putin is the actual beneficiary of ao rossiya whose titular owner will be president dmitriy anatolyevich medvedev
1103483 and there is something else or actually two things that should be borne in mind
1103484 if he had stayed on after 2008 there was a chance that the regime would have been illegitimate because it would have violated the constitution and the west does not like this so it might have taken an interest in the gunvor company at the very least
1103485 you must obey the law always not only when they grab you by your special place

1103493 everyone has a right to run for president who qualifies according to the constitution
1103494 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president the former president told abc
1103495 i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year
1103496 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office

1103528 unexpressed concerns can keep patients from accepting recommended surgeries that may be very beneficial for them
1103529 if patients dont bring up concerns with their orthopaedic surgeon then the opportunity to help is missed for example if a patients unexpressed concern is based on incorrect information a surgeon will be hard pressed to help
1103530 our study also found that many patients do not mention worries about their capacity to meet the demands of surgery especially in the post operative period likely thinking that the surgeon cannot help but orthopaedic surgeons may be able to direct patients to social workers and other professional staff who can
1103531 patients are individuals not the left shoulder in room 2 but sometimes orthopaedic surgeons become so technically focused that we forget to develop that necessary personal relationship
1103532 about 20 to 30 percent of patients who undergo a knee or hip replacement end up having someone else do the surgery because they didnt feel a personal connection was established in that first meeting with the orthopaedic surgeon
1103533 improved communication skills can be learned and even small changes can make a big difference
1103534 this research strongly supports our programs emphasis on specific techniques that allow us to be more empathetic with our patients since the average orthopaedic surgeon sees 160 000 patients during his or her career aaos communication skills workshops can have a significant impact on patient care
1103535 is there something else you want to talk about today
1103536 there are potential therapeutic benefits associated with simply allowing for the expression of these concerns
1103537 listening to our patients demonstrates a willingness on the part of the surgeon to engage in a dialogue with patients that supports their decision making simply offering some empathy and reassurance can go a long way in easing a patients concerns about surgery
1103538 we know that our communities are facing critical issues such as adult and childhood obesity insufficient family support and lack of affordable child care ymca programs address these profound needs and our growth speaks to the great work ymcas across the country do every day to improve the lives of kids families and people in need
1103539 while we are pleased with the numbers were even prouder of what they represent real positive outcomes in peoples lives we are honored that so many people look to the ymca as an essential part of their well being
1103540 we deeply value the commitment and support that we receive from our volunteers partners and donors
1103541 only with their support are ymcas able to meet the unique needs of the communities we serve
1103542 no other transparency tool in the colorado market today provides the depth of information on the total costs of procedures as anthem care comparison
1103543 through this tool our members have access to the costs associated with all aspects of a specific medical procedure not just the cost of the procedure itself but also the costs of the entire spectrum of care from lab tests to recovery room charges these medical care cost estimates will help our members better understand the overall costs they are likely to incur before a medical service is provided
1103544 ultimately we want anthem care comparison to create well informed consumers of health care
1103545 creating well informed consumers employers physicians and hospital providers is an important element of transparency and an essential step in transforming the consumers role in their own health care

1103569 obstetricians are rendering large numbers of women uninsurable by overusing this surgery
1103570 you have women just caught in the middle of this huge triangle of hospitals insurance companies and doctors pointing the finger at each other
1103571 sometimes the coverage will come with a rider saying that coverage for a caesarean delivery is excluded for a period of time
1103572 in many respects it works a lot like other situations where someone has a condition that will foreshadow the potential for higher costs going forward
1103573 if you dont work for someone who has insurance and you have to get insurance on your own this is terrifying
1103574 the aggravating thing is there are a lot of elective caesareans and that adds to costs
1103575 it made me feel very helpless these were not caesareans i wanted they were not elective caesareans i very much wanted natural births with both babies and was not able to have them and to have to pay for that for years is outrageous and i feel its discriminatory as well
1103576 if the caesarean section was considered by the physician to be medically necessary for the safety of the mother or child then coverage is issued without conditions if the procedure was determined to be elective coverage would be offered with a temporary waiver or at a higher premium rate
1103577 i think its really a very small amount but we need more data
1103578 i would think if its happening the medical profession has to take a stand
1103579 my understanding is that once youre denied its hard to get other insurance
1103580 youre doing so good lorena you are almost there and i am so proud of you
1103581 mom how painful is it to have a natural birth
1103582 when you had us did it ever cross your mind that you werent going to make it
1103583 of course but you are my daughter and i could never bring myself to tell you that why would i want to instill fear in your head when i knew you wanted this so bad and i had faith you could do it
1103584 its a violation of our domestic law it is a violation of our values as americans and a violation of international norms and laws the debatable thing now is whether the cruel inhumane or degrading treatment of a particular detainee falls under the same category some of this stuff gets to the point where it really tears at the fabric of what we are as americans and our american values
1103585 we know very well that 1937 was the peak of the purges but this year was well prepared by years of cruelty
1103586 happen when ostensibly attractive but empty ideas are put above fundamental values values of human life of rights and freedom
1103587 hundreds of thousands millions of people were killed and sent to camps shot and tortured
1103588 these were people with their own ideas which they were unafraid of speaking out about they were the cream of the nation
1103589 to develop the country and choose the right path we need political debates and even battles but to make this process creative they should not be conducted outside the cultural framework

1103591 i rooted for kasparov against karpov in the eighties because of kasparovs anti communism and karpov stood for soviet power
1103592 but now we live in a different world we need to be more assertive in the world if nato includes ukraine and georgia and other states on our border developing so called democracy that tells us that you
1103593 the west needs someone to run russia for them someone to order around as their instrument and they want to do that with garry kasparov

1103626 nadat ik de programmas van real madrid en het nederlands elftal nog eens goed had bestudeerd kwam het besef dat ik gezien de vereiste fysieke inspanning om op dit niveau maximaal te presteren een keuze moest maken
1103627 de combinatie van enerzijds de competitie beker en champions leaguewedstrijden van real madrid en het programma van het nederlands elftal anderzijds is voor mij een te zware belasting er rest mij dan ook geen andere keuze
1103628 the government is claiming that the elections were held in free and fair manner but it is seen that casting of votes was low due to lack of public enthusiasm
1103629 the hc bench did not want to interfere with the appellate division decision in this case the court however asked us to move another application if the charge is framed in the case
1103630 well not compromise with cases that involve large scale corruption
1103631 the idea of tac can be considered as a pay off
1103632 if a law is passed issues will be dealt in accordance with that law the truth and accountability commission has been formed following huge debate and discussion so if any individual tries to raise a question regarding its formation it would come to no help
1103633 we have informed them about our rules and assured them that we are not an institution for taking action
1103634 we have sent the public notification to the information ministry and it would be published in renowned national dailies as soon as possible
1103635 how could the polling officer allow someone else to cast my vote when theres my photograph printed on the new voter roll
1103636 the government spent a lot of public money on the nid but now it is useless for voting purposes
1103637 only about 4 3 percent of 116 polling centres experienced any problem related to security forces on election day observers in three city corporation reported no security concerns however in sylhet in 14 8 percent of polling centre observers reported that security officials were not performing their duties in a neutral way
1103638 observers were prevented from entering 17 5 percent of polling centres in three city corporations
1103639 voter turnout was satisfactory despite the prevalence of inclement weather in some areas but the polling process was rather slow
1103640 fema has observed problems faced by some voters due to the confusion related to voter list with photo kept by polling officials and voter list without photo used by candidates
1103641 the poll by and large ended under peaceful atmosphere and no major untoward incident was reported the poll in a broader sense was free and fair though a few cases of impersonation came to the notice of the fema observers
1103642 since the voting environment was favourable for the voters they participated willingly
1103643 most of the voters expressed their satisfaction regarding the overall environment in the centres
1103644 it was the first vote in my life but i could not cast it
1103645 the candidate who could possibly win might lose because of this
1103646 i am going home and i have not cast my vote i have been turned away four times from the booth because i did not have a voter serial number and then when i got it they could not find it on the list
1103647 it is not our duty to provide the serial numbers
1103648 it was a fault in their the election commission preparations and not ours
1103649 voters suffered because of mismanagement and slow vote casting but the voter turnout was good
1103650 the kd 20 was not enough even for my survival in kuwait yet i continued with the job with the hope of making a buck from some extra work for my family
1103651 i was sleeping in the barrack when many workers went on strike outside suddenly the police entered our barrack and started beating up us
1103652 in the cell the police treated us as if we were animals they beat up with strong rods whenever anyone tried to speak or stand up in the rooms crowded with six to seven hundred workers
1103653 can you imagine how the expectations of my family my children were shattered when i returned empty handed and injured from that cloud cuckoo land after two years
1103654 i knew kuwaiti police dont like strike as my wage was moderate there was no question of going on strike but still we were arrested beaten up and deported
1103655 the authorities now took revenge on those who were in the barracks several hundred workers were injured in cop beating and rubber bullets but nobody was there to look after them
1103656 you cant imagine how the workers felt when they were forced to sit on the hot sand where candle stick melts if you notice carefully youll find the workers arriving in the airport are stumbling
1103657 we did not go to kuwait to go on strike our salary was so small that we could not survive on that if any of us are guilty punish us but dont punish the innocent make neutral investigation before punishing us
1103658 it seemed the flames spiralled up the staircase and chased down eight members of a family burning them alive as they were climbing up the staircase to the roof
1103659 only those who tried to go up to the roof died the fire did not enter any rooms of the building and therefore 18 year old shanto is the lone survivor of the family as he was in a room on the first floor
1103660 hearing the hue and cry for help i opened the door of my flat and saw flames raging through the staircase with astonishing speed i was burnt but managed to close the door
1103661 a lit candle fell on a can of glue igniting it and over hundred other glue cans stored there the shooting flames went up the staircase
1103662 the fire would not have had happened if the highly flammable glue was not stored in a residential building
1103663 im going back without casting my vote even though i stood in the queue for the last two hours
1103664 weve got to go a bit slow as we need to find out their serial numbers on the voter list
1103665 i know of no obstacles to polling today yesterday we wont have any difficulty conducting the general election under the state of emergency if the government can ensure an atmosphere like todays
1103666 well only want an environment conducive to holding free and fair election whether the state of emergency will be lifted or not rests with the government
1103667 i dont think it has any implications for the conduct of polls
1103668 we are facing problems in identifying voters as most of them dont know their registration numbers
1103669 i didnt vote and am returning home after not being able to find my voter registration number
1103670 the territorial dfos are too much involved in managing the forests and producing revenue for the government they have no time for wildlife management
1103671 the sanctuaries have not been marked yet with markings on trees or lanes as is the practice in other countries
1103672 today none of the ducks are found in pablakhali as they have either been killed or their habitation was destroyed with the felling of tall trees above 30 feet
1103673 immediately after taking possession of the land the fisheries department leased out the land to private entrepreneurs who chopped off the forest and forced the macaques to leave bangladesh for myanmar
1103674 for the forest departments actions the country lost the monkey and the forest as well biologically the monkey variety was important because it represented the western most limit of the species that ranged from indonesia to bangladesh
1103675 among the larger birds we had lesser adjutant stork grey headed fishing eagle brown wood owl crested honey buzzard crested serpent eagle and several other species of day time and night time birds of prey that used to be seen regularly in madhupur
1103676 so to change the situation we must create a separate wildlife department equivalent to the forest and environment departments
1103677 when the environment department was separated from the forest ministry it had far fewer manpower or budget than the wildlife circle that the present forest department has the forest department should allocate fund for the wildlife department taking into account the sanctuaries and national parks and game reserves it has created and also the environmentally critical areas declared by the environment department without taking into cognition of the existing wildlife act the wildlife department should have its own recruitment policy and separate cadre service
1103678 people wanting to get inside the sanctuaries or parks to have a look at the wildlife will need to take permission from the wildlife department for some fees
1103679 the department will serve as field research station for all the universities and other research organisations this will generate earnings for the department as well

1103683 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
1103684 i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1103685 lets just say that you do become president and a democratic congress raises taxes what would you do would you veto it
1103686 sure sure id veto it i think if were gonna be in some shaky times and by the way i believe the fundamentals of americas economy are still strong then the worst thing you can do is increase taxes at that time
1103687 if you already own a solar system perhaps you want to upgrade it perhaps youve installed central air in the past few years or want to make the switch from propane based to electric heating residential solar energy costs are now such that you can cheaply add panels as needed to your system without emptying your wallet depending on the brand a typical solar panel which generates 300 watts at peak times will cost anywhere from 1 500 to 2 000 as efficiency in solar panels increases they will generate more electricity while getting smaller meaning that youll get more energy along with lower solar energy systems costs while its unlikely that they will become truly mainstream for years yet residential solar energy costs fall every single year and these systems are sold by more companies

1103711 the rbi program was instrumental in my life in many ways
1103712 it helped me to go to college and it was also very important in my baseball development the rbi program should be commended on the difference it has made in the lives of so many youngsters im proud to be an rbi alumnus

1103715 the stated requirements of marriage in islam are as follows full consent of both partners to the marriage expressing the above consent through ijab offer and qabul acceptance finally the presence of two reliable witnesses apart from the above in the case of females their guardians consent has been considered essential for the validity of marriage according to the majority of imams and scholars imam abu hanifah however is of the view that a mature woman is fully capable of contracting her own marriage thus in his view marriages finalized without guardians consent shall be considered as valid so long the woman has chosen someone who is considered as compatible
1103716 short term marriages are a form of legalized prostitution a state must not and cannot legitimize prostitution
1103717 also married women are forbidden to you in marriage except those whom you own as slaves
1103718 this is a violation of childrens rights this constitutes sexual assault of the girl what does pleasure from sexual contact with her thighs mean it means deriving sexual pleasure from an infant how old is an infant one year a year and a half a few months

1103720 between 60 and 80 of marriages in afghanistan are forced marriages which give women no right to refuse many of those marriages especially in the rural areas involve girls below the age of 15
1103721 badakhshan northeastern province has the highest maternal mortality rate in the country and one of the main reasons is under age marriages even as young as seven in some cases this needs to be addressed
1103722 it is a shame to say that even in the capital kabul we treat pregnant mothers as young as 12 years of age

1103726 forced marriages whatever the social or cultural imperatives that may be said to justify what remains a distressingly widespread practice are rightly considered to be as much beyond the pale as such barbarous practices as female genital mutilation and so called honor killings
1103727 the girl is absolutely petrified i am terrified the family will put her on a plane within the next few days
1103728 i want to know and many thousands of muslim girls and women have a right to know why understanding and infinite tolerance is practiced with particular cultural traditions that are clearly oppressive of women human rights are universal and unconditional and that goes most certainly for religious objectives it is only girls and women who are forced to wear head scarves and its also a majority of girls and women who are affected by forced marriage i dont want to enter into the debate about women and schoolgirls who wear the headscarf of their own free will or about the difference between arranged and forced marriages just one note silence cannot be understood as assent but very many girls are brought up to be silent on such topics of course we mustnt forget the boys and men they too are affected by these archaic traditions they are forced to play the man the protector of morals and family honour they bear the responsibility for keeping the sexuality of the female members under control a free autonomous life the esteem for a persons individuality is seen to endanger the far more important community feeling the group identity in extreme cases men are turned into murderers because the social system demands this of them because otherwise they cannot live after their honor has been violated what will become of the muslims who dont have the personal strength to defend themselves against the community and the clan because of this outmoded tradition what will become of the little machos who already play the pascha in kindergarten and grade school
1103729 this is an outrageous activity one we wont tolerate and were intent on stamping out it is an offence to traffic a young person a juvenile overseas for sexual servitude or indeed bondage and a forced marriage could well constitute that sort of behavior

1103855 the failure of the global fund pepfar the world bank and the worlds other global health bodies to devote significant resources toward reducing hiv rates among msm is indefensible these organizations have policies on women drug users migration but not one of them has a comprehensive policy on msm
1103856 unfortunately when it comes to human rights and hiv somewhere between the declarations and the practice many governments fall into a hole that is especially true when sexuality is introduced into policy debates
1103857 governments should be concerned about the corrosive effects on broader society both epidemiologically and otherwise that arise when they repress people on the basis of sexuality

1104110 we found that both men and women with sleep apnea in the general population not patients mostly undiagnosed and untreated had poorer survival compared with persons without sleep apnea given equal bmi age and sex
1104111 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
1104112 our findings suggest but cannot prove that people diagnosed with sleep apnea should be treated and if cpap is the prescribed treatment regular use may prevent premature death
1104113 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits
1104114 by the time they reach eight years old theyre already far into the overweight category making treatment more difficult
1104115 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early

1104117 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend

1104120 people may not get a heart attack until their 50s or 60s but arteries begin to clog in childhood
1104121 most of these kids meals appear to be designed to put americas children on the fast track to obesity disability heart attack or diabetes
1104122 these results are an impressive start we will work to continue to drive people with type 2 diabetes to their doctors and other resources that can help them improve how they manage their conditions
1104123 blue cross goal was to join together with local employers and providers and help our members in the area who have diabetes be healthier
1104124 similar to the medical home concept as part of this program physicians provided comprehensive coordinated care for their patients that enhanced their health
1104125 taking these tests and knowing the results are significant first steps toward better diabetes management we are encouraged that with early detection treatment and proper management people with diabetes may prevent or delay the onset of complications associated with the disease which range from heart and blood vessel disease blindness and kidney failure to nerve damage foot ulcers and urological problems

1104187 they often act impulsively when they lose control of themselves and the availability of a weapon at home facilitates this impulsiveness
1104188 often people realise very quickly that they are happy to continue living
1104189 we can prove that in other countries which have tightened their laws concerning the availability of guns it also changed suicide rates considerably such as in canada australia and britain
1104190 this is the only question we cant answer with a single straightforward answer
1104191 in each individual case there are always three to four factors that lead people to commit suicide
1104192 before then they dont have the legal basis to take action like its possible in hiv aids addictions alcohol and tobacco
1104193 some cantons are interested in prevention and are doing things but there is no strategy at the national level
1104194 we dont understand the current approach to suicide prevention which is outdated
1104195 the government presents suicide as a problem linked to schizophrenia or depression but studies in other countries show that 40 60 per cent of cases are not connected to depression we need to do campaigns focusing on suicide itself

1104210 you mean i could be murdered in the bathroom with an electric toothbrush
1104211 i want the team to play similarly to the way i play my game although you have to be accountable for the things you do and be responsible for the decisions you make
1104212 ive learnt a lot from michael from the way he has been around the team and the way hes spoken to players the way he commands himself
1104213 the way i play is by gut instinct i like to do things spontaneously do what i feel is right in the situation
1104214 over the years ive played cricket ive gained a good cricket brain in terms of how i do things
1104215 my gut instinct when im batting for the first few years ive played for england has certainly been something that has assisted me tremendously
1104216 i will always ask for advice i will also be listening ill always ask questions i will always take advice from people
1104217 its exciting for me its something that is a brand new test a brand new challenge and i love challenges
1104218 i hope it wont restrict the way i play and i think it will be silly for me to start thinking it definitely will affect the way i play
1104219 i play the way i play and its a way that ive been successful with so far in my career its something i want to try and keep at a really high level
1104220 i just see this as a fantastic opportunity to grab with both hands and to go with it and run with it
1104221 if it doesnt work and it affects a few things in terms of my personal life or if affects the way that i bat then i will be man enough to say so
1104222 im not going to be a wimp and say im not going to do it im not going to take it on board and im going to give it a really good go like i give everything in my life a good go
1104223 ive just recently got married to liberty x singer jessica taylor and if you look at what michael said about the last nine months and what hes been like at home its interesting to hear

1104230 we traditionally try to save the kidney for smaller tumors for larger tumors however patients would get a very large incision on their side
1104231 here we were able to remove the tumor through a three inch incision right at the patients belly button unlike the commonly performed laparoscopic surgeries there is only one tiny incision here
1104232 i think this is going to be a big advance when removing the entire kidney
1104233 that is typically for larger kidney tumors and it is a great advance over traditional open and laparoscopic surgeries
1104234 my robotic instruments are like having hands inside the body
1104235 we seem to really be pushing the envelope by doing a tumor thats 12 centimeters in size
1104236 id say that encompasses 99 percent of tumors and i really think weve made an advance here that were going to be able to do for most large kidney cancers
1104237 children growing up exposed to sustained trauma and violence are at increased risk for mental disorders such as depression anxiety acute stress disorder post traumatic stress disorder ptsd and substance abuse even 2 years after the oklahoma city bombing 16 percent of children living 100 miles away from oklahoma city were still experiencing post traumatic stress symptoms three phenomena have been identified in children exposed to persistent and extreme violence fear aggression and desensitization

1104259 no one wants to go to jail but like i said youve got to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1104260 it should be over with after the second 30 days all of this comes from the juvenile thing
1104261 i went to court about it and thats just what was said
1104262 of course its always going to be in the back of your head
1104263 with me when im on the field im in another mind state and i just go out there and play my game

1104270 i aint got on the scale i dont really get on the scale thats not my thing

1104273 thats coachs decision when he wants me back out there but i always feel like i can play
1104274 hes going to come out there and you watch hes going to make a splash when he gets going again caseys a freak the guy goes out there he can weigh whatever he weighs i dont want to throw out a weight and hes still quick as can be he still can move
1104275 its just a whole mess you want to go you want to retire they want to move on and the next thing you know he wants to come back but for what hes done for that organization he should have that right
1104276 id eat your heart out but my teeth are sore
1104277 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
1104278 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments
1104279 schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
1104280 while he is right to highlight the vital need for good local schools his proposals to increase choice and diversity of schools is diametrically opposed to that idea
1104281 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation
1104282 all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs
1104283 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
1104284 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
1104285 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
1104286 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
1104287 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
1104288 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
1104289 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
1104290 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
1104291 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
1104292 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
1104293 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
1104294 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
1104295 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
1104296 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
1104297 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
1104298 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
1104299 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
1104300 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
1104301 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
1104302 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
1104303 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
1104304 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
1104305 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
1104306 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
1104307 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
1104308 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
1104309 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
1104310 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
1104311 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
1104312 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

1104340 as you know it was because of an illness that i first preached the word to you even though my illness was a trial to you you did not treat me with contempt or scorn instead you welcomed me as if i were an angel of god as if i were christ jesus himself
1104341 i can testify that if you could have done so you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me
1104342 i came to you in weakness and fear and with much trembling
1104343 why put up with this same impossible pattern over and over and over again paul why not just give it up
1104344 paul it is just who you are that gets in the way you are the problem why fight what you cant change
1104345 if you had the problems i have you wouldnt talk so much about the power of god being made perfect in weakness
1104346 i will all the more gladly boast of my weaknesses that the power of christ may rest upon me for the sake of christ then i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for when i am weak then i am strong
1104347 conformity impulse buying defining self worth by what you own and seeking happiness through the acquisition of material goods are traits that marketing inculcates in consumers all of these are antithetical to creativity which draws sustenance from inner resources rather than external dictates fads fancies or rewards creativity is characterized by originality the capacity for critical thinking and the ability both to recognize the difficulty in a problem and to search for solutions its not in marketers best interests for consumers to think too much too well or too critically about their products

1104349 theres some unintentional irony in the fact that so many toys today are labeled
1104350 we can no longer take the silence of reading and the integrity of books for granted the precious initial quiet around harry potter was irrevocably shattered by the click of e commerce and the jingle of cash registers harry is now a brand we not only have the film series we have harry potter school products toys and food as well as a result fans of the book relinquish not just money but a piece of themselves to time warner owner of the licensing rights the images we see on the screen are not ours they belong to chris columbus and to whoever directs the sequels six figure production budgets guarantee lots of nifty special effects and nothing is left to the viewers imagination
1104351 before author j k rowling sold the licensing rights to warner brothers for a mere 500 000 her books were a respite from a culture saturated by commercial and electronic media children got to exercise their own creativity as they interacted with rowlings imaginary world they didnt need products to enjoy the story all they needed was themselves and a book now children reading harry potter for the first time will know what his world looks like before they even open a book they will be deprived of a chance to conjure their own visions of the hogwarts school for wizards and its occupants once they see the films children will no longer assign their own cadence and movement to their favorite characters

1104376 they can do a lot of things that the city council cant do like make loans sell bonds own property sell property lease property they can operate a lot like the housing authority my vision is to have a stronger industrial development authority i feel that its a tool that we have not utilized to its full potential
1104377 become financially independent of the council and the city again like the housing authority
1104378 the result of this would be to hopefully free up money that the city council is now putting out for economic development which is a sizable amount we could free this money up for other city services that we have needs for down the road i understand wed have to seed money to them in the beginning but it would be my hope that they could become self sufficient
1104379 what we couldnt come to grips with before is if youre out on your own youve got to have your own revenue stream and thats what we couldnt get our hands around certainly you can get seed money from the city and get things going but how do you keep that revenue stream going
1104380 you really cant make that continuous stream as an eda
1104381 are there things you can do to make money yes there are there are ways to generate revenue but can you do that as a continuous stream to fund the organization two years ago we looked around the state to look at idas and edas to look for similar models where they separate the two and hire their own director there are several models out there that do that but the common thread to all those models is that they are funded by their local governments
1104382 what you would have to do to be really successful at that would be to have a model that would incorporate several things
1104383 when you do financings like industrial revenue bonds you do set fees so you would collect those fees
1104384 it would be tough to do that just from scratch
1104385 youd pretty much need to develop a plan to allow for some transition time it would be pretty hard to do that from day one youd really need local government to do some of the funding until those various revenue sources began to create enough to be self sufficient
1104386 no matter where you end up the funding will have to come from the city
1104387 one concern ive had with the talk ive heard so far is people saying that if we use this new structure we can save the city a million dollars
1104388 we are delighted to offer property managers a way to bring in more revenue and more bookings through our fully integrated dynamic pricing offering we are also confident consumers will be excited to receive significant savings on their vacation lodging this is a win win situation for property managers and consumers alike

1104429 the real trouble is that the pure word of jesus has been overlaid with so much human ballast burdensome rules and regulations false hopes and consolations that it has become extremely difficult to make a genuine decision for christ

1104468 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money
1104469 it is a terribly sad situation and i really feel bad for all the couples who have had the disruption and embarrassment at this time
1104470 if hsbc were able to take a more pragmatic view and use this money to fulfill these deliveries then all the couples and their guests would be happy but sadly we are not a big enough company to make them inclined to change the rules its a ridiculous situation
1104471 we did what we could to help wrapit and it certainly and quite obviously isnt in our interests for it to go into administration faced with its worsening financial situation we had no other choice

1104476 retro or vintage licensed apparel has grown pretty nicely over the last twelve to eighteen months
1104477 i think when youre looking at any type of change in the growth rate over and above low to mid single digits as the vintage market is today thats more a reaction to fashion trends than something driven by the fan consumer because the fan consumer is fairly consistent
1104478 at some point that growth will wane but there will always be a core base there

1104483 when youre dealing with an nfl or an nhl they give you the opportunity to use their team names and marks but you do all the research for them and they turn around and give the contract to competitors two years later they also tend to edit and sanitize the history and i never responded well to being hemmed in and edited in that way

1104486 everything comes from the streets and everything comes from the community
1104487 the interest in retro is cyclical and now it happens to be in a really high cycle
1104488 but when its not a trend anymore well still be here and still be making stuff that i consider timeless

1104517 la entrada fue fuerte fue muy fuerte pero creo que el trabajo que se estuvo haciendo de prevenci n con el preparador f sico y la reacci n que tuvo gonzalo para poder corregir el movimiento forzado que le genero riveros eso fue lo hizo que el diagn stico se m s leve de lo que pudo haber sido esos son los factores fundamentales para que nada m s tenga un esguince de ligamento colateral medial

1104537 this blog has been locked due to possible blogger terms of service violations
1104538 you may not publish new posts until your blog is reviewed and unlocked
1104539 at first i thought it was just this random thing with bloggers spam bots
1104540 i thought that perhaps in their looking across the blogger universe that i got accidentally flagged somehow stuff like that happens
1104541 i also felt a little bit humiliated that someone would think to characterize my blog as spam
1104542 i had no idea why it would be spam i assumed it was just some sort of mistake i did think it was an isolated incident i requested the blogger review i then went to the
1104543 i suspect that it was obama supporters because i think the block was timed to affect blogs prior to the unity event so that we would not rain on the unity parade geeklove said
1104544 also obama has ads out hiring people with no experience except the ability to use computers i presume these are the individuals responsible for silencing any opposition his campaign has really harnessed the power of the internet and in the process learned to game the system in a way that i find frightening
1104545 we were contacted by our host in march and they claimed we were draining too many resources
1104546 they shut us down completely but when we went in to look at our site statistics it was evident that something else was clearly going on we were the subject of some kind of spam attack that was putting a strain on the site
1104547 the problem with these people who had their google accounts shut down theyre intimidated by it
1104548 they dont want to get themselves in a situation so they would be identified some of these people who get identified the obama folks start picking up the phone and calling i had phone calls into my office threatening me saying that youre going to be fired let me talk to your boss i told them to go fuck themselves because i am my own boss it helps to be self employed
1104549 my biggest objection is not necessarily that these people did this but that blogger had the policy that basically locks you out
1104550 in other words youre guilty until proven innocent instead of the other way around and that was what frustrated me
1104551 i understand the need if you have some complaints from people that you need to investigate it
1104552 but you also have to make sure that the person filing the complaint is legitimate
1104553 while i am expressing my political beliefs on blogger it was a simple push of a button to mark my blog as spam and silence me
1104554 pushing the button set me back a couple of days and i was unable to post anything during the unity event the prospect of starting over on another blog was also daunting and i briefly only briefly considered giving up blogging tactics like this work to silence opposition why wouldnt we expect more of that in the future

1104722 mcdonalds has partnered with the national gay and lesbian chamber of commerce nglcc
1104723 it also gave this activist group a 20 000 grant to support its efforts to influence corporate america
1104724 when my son bounds out of kindergarten at his school a typical request is to go to old mcdonalds
1104725 like levi strauss mcdonalds has become an open and aggressive supporter of the homosexual agenda
1104726 as such it will no longer receive my business until it rejects the homosexual political agenda and returns to what it does best selling happy meals and fun to americas children
1104727 he wants a pro life running mate and romney qualifies for that
1104728 denver is a for sure and st paul were still discussing
1104729 but it would be done in a way that honored the partys commitment to the pro life cause
1104730 most of the people at the convention are with us we own the convention but heres the deal it took 30 or 35 years to move away from american values and itll take a while longer to win the country back so we can be patient
1104731 for the few months ive known what the heck it was
1104732 one thing i would like to say to you is this and i basically even talked to our team about it this is not about me it is not about me this is about a team getting ready for a football season were talking about this season were not talking about future seasons or anything like that i would really appreciate from you the media to dont put the focus on something other than what i just talked about about this team and about this season anything else really isnt fair to these kids thats not why you play the game of football you play the game of football to go out as a football team and be excited to go out and do your very best
1104733 i think the running back situation could be as strong as its been at syracuse in a number of years
1104734 i believe this will be a very good defense i just dont know when
1104735 i just thought it would be kind of funny to create an e mail address based on a random senator whose name no one could spell
1104736 mr obama good luck in the rest of the election year please let me know if you have any real estate needs
1104737 inflation caught up with the project because it dragged on so long

1104739 paul hodes has done nothing in congress to help us through this very difficult time of high gas prices and an unknown energy future after a series of saying no paul hodes along with his pelosi colleagues said yes to a summer vacation refusing to even consider the plight of the folks back home
1104740 they dont think we deserve even a discussion on possible solutions
1104741 im pleased to see bob clegg finally talking about energy policy
1104742 the duty of state government is to serve and protect people our first job is making sure we are serving the public and are available to the public the state director of personnel is currently reviewing telecommuting policies with that goal in mind and we would consider any proposals for a four day week in the same vein
1104743 its really just something we put together because for a lot of people our age its hard to do the things we really want to do without lots of experience for example im the director but i have no experience ive wanted to try it and blackbox gives me that opportunity
1104744 its the same thing with the musical director milne and the lighting designer etter these are all things weve wanted to try but the only way to get the opportunity was to do this do it ourselves
1104745 they make you want to have that ability to direct
1104746 of course theyre not going to hire you if you havent done lighting design for example they need to find the best and make it the best show possible so what were hoping to do is offer the youth in the seacoast the opportunity to gain the experience and be given the opportunity with experience they might be able to do something for a theater like seacoast rep or the players ring
1104747 when i need something i ask when im facing problems with how to get something across to the cast or a staging issue ill ask rob scullin im not asking to the point of having them stage for me but i ask to understand the process better
1104748 we didnt know how to get them up to specs for mgi the company that owned the rights
1104749 we didnt know theres things like the authors name has to be on it in a certain spot its something very specific stacy told us it wasnt legal then we went back to the contract to see what needed to be done
1104750 wed rather not make mistakes but its not awful that we do because were working in an environment that allows for it and expects that mistakes will be made it really is a learning process for us
1104751 i think the mistakes really help us the struggles are necessary its the only way were going to understand
1104752 to be honest we had a passion for the show and its a good thing we had that passion because if we didnt i dont think we would have pulled it off
1104753 what were trying to do is just not constrain ourselves if we can put up a percussion ensemble with 10 kids and put on a great show well do it
1104754 its going to be a really fluid organization once youve hit 21 youre out someone is going to replace you in another year the founders will all be gone and theyll be all new people
1104755 anyone who takes a bath on friday and cleans himself as much as he can and puts oil on his hair or scents himself and then proceeds for the prayer and does not force his way between two persons assembled in the mosque for the friday prayer and prays as much as is written for him and remains quiet when the imam delivers the khutba all his sins in between the present and the last friday will be forgiven

1104767 you dont have to buy the hardware and software you just subscribe theres not a lot of capital outlay the attraction to that is huge
1104768 a thousand dollars a month raises a lot of eyebrows
1104769 if it was your home bill you would look into it no matter how affluent you are
1104770 we started paying attention to the top talkers and their bills are difficult to justify
1104771 if the starting point is entirely unmanaged and the new state is tightly controlled
1104772 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1104773 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1104774 people are looking for any excuse to sell oil right now
1104775 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1104776 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1104777 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1104778 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices

1104785 our veterans deserve the best from this country but our nation is failing them by forcing them to wait months to receive the assistance theyve earned
1104786 this legislation will ensure that our current and future veterans receive accurate and timely benefits that they deserve and it will dramatically reduce the claims process system
1104787 i strongly support legislation to help improve and increase beach water monitoring in our great lakes communities and throughout the state
1104788 i am also continuing to work to increase federal funding for sewer upgrades and other clean water infrastructure projects which have been decimated under the bush administration

1104801 the opportunity to retire at first eligibility only comes once and im trying to take advantage of that so that i can think about what the next chapter in my life might want to contain
1104802 i have very much enjoyed working for the brighton central school district
1104803 its a wonderful district and i enjoyed the challenges of the job but after 33 years in the business and 15 as a school superintendent i think it might be time
1104804 i dont know if the board itself will do the search or if we will hire somebody else or an outside search organization
1104805 we had eagle do the search for us then we went to our then superintendent harv peris to recommend people whom he thought would do the job and thats how we met dr manaseri
1104806 you know if you start off and things go well it could be five to six months it could be the beginning of the next school year
1104807 if we dont find any takers or few takers for the project and it becomes less viable to keep producing power in this plant then the entire public money would be a waste
1104808 we could prepare a ppa with a clause that distcoms can recover the cost by imposing differential tariff

1104811 the accused told thakran that a bottle of the chemical costs about 20 000 us dollars and he would need money to import the chemical from nigeria
1104812 the government provides foodgrains at approximately one third the market price to these ration card holders instead of giving them the foodstuff the government can put the money in the card holders bank account we have received an in principle clearance from the government of india of the 70 food circles in delhi we will select one for the pilot of the scheme
1104813 at present the fake ration cards are mostly kept by pds shops in nexus with department officials and local politicians
1104814 the present climate with high humidity is conducive to breeding of the aedes mosquito responsible for the spread of the disease
1104815 it raises serious doubts about the workings of mcd departmental heads it should be made clear to officials that any lethargy with regard to checking mosquito breeding will not be tolerated
1104816 if breeding is detected at any zonal office the deputy commissioner should be pulled up and if found repeating the offence the zonal deputy health officer should be held responsible

1104821 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1104822 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1104823 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1104824 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1104825 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1104826 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1104884 just like american players and coaches have raised the level of basketball around the world project hope has increased the knowledge and skills of the doctors and nurses in china giving these kids the best care possible
1104885 usa basketball players and legends were truly ambassadors of goodwill today and heightened the spirits of the children they met
1104886 similarly project hope is deeply honored to express the goodwill of the american people through our work at the hospital and through other humanitarian efforts that have improved the health of china

1104894 el estado totalitario es uno de los peores males que pueden sobrevivir a la humanidad y a los pueblos que los sufren
1104895 el estado totalitario como un peligroso bacilo que envenena a la comunidad de naciones y la hace incapaz de garantizar la seguridad de cada uno de los pueblos representa un continuo peligro de guerra

1104901 hey why not suggest that the governator amp his school board take this algebra test in public and the results for public consumption
1104902 everybody knows my views on the pernicious nature of political parties and im sure the governments scheme the political associations will prevent them degenerating to the point of becoming sectarian and adversarial groups
1104903 that is not true and what you are saying is very serious
1104904 i know that when i die everything will be different but there are oaths that have to be kept and principles that have to remain in place

1104911 based on the existing body of evidence and our experience implementing male circumcision to strengthen our prevention efforts we are asking the international community to help national governments and their partners to introduce male circumcision wherever hiv prevalence is greatest and circumcision rates are lowest in the nations of eastern and southern africa
1104912 as news gets out about the efficacy of male circumcision we need to meet that demand with quality services and a comprehensive hiv prevention approach and scale up male circumcision as an ethical human rights issue
1104913 we seem to forget that we have an intervention that is 60 to 70 percent effective for preventing hiv in men more effective than any vaccine currently under development
1104914 but the word is getting out just by word of mouth the demand is so great that already men are going to unqualified practitioners and experiencing serious complications we must scale up our response rapidly to meet the demand for safe circumcision services
1104915 specific cells in the foreskin are favored targets for hiv infection
1104916 also the inside of the foreskin lacks the tough covering that protects most skin from infection
1104917 circumcision status was not associated with any sexual dysfunction or with specific sexual dysfunctions premature ejaculation pain during intercourse erectile dysfunction at follow up visits
1104918 the results of this study suggest that hiv risk behaviors are unlikely to increase they may even decline as we saw in our study
1104919 we were struck by this monumental research that shows circumcision having the greatest efficacy in curbing the spread of heterosexual transmission of hiv to date greater than any vaccine in the pipeline today
1104920 free in both mind and body of concerns over hiv
1104921 was how many men seek out the service without our doing any marketing at all of the male circumcision program leading to the concern that awareness of the impact on transmission without access to services may lead to unsafe practices
1104922 well build service roads and other things as money starts flowing in
1104923 remember how we used to thrill ourselves at 80 miles an hour well now we can do it at two miles an hour

1104929 in most cases we found that the parent or other adult responsible for supervising the child simply was not present when the injury occurred
1104930 young children need nearly constant supervision and of course thats not always possible but it should be the parents highest priority many infants died because parents placed them in an unsafe sleep environment parents may not be aware of whats safe and what isnt especially with so much new information being released about safe sleeping environments for infants in other cases parents failed to use mandated safety devices such as car seats or the adult was present when the injury occurred but could not protect the child because they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol
1104931 what we know is that these injuries can be prevented
1104932 the importance of intervention is huge recognizing at risk families can help care providers take proper action nurses and other health care providers often encounter families with young children but there isnt enough time to address all aspects of child care with every single family care providers can use these findings to identify high risk families and provide them with specific information or referrals

1104937 cluzzle is a fun filled game that combines creativity communication strategy and self expression in cluzzle players outwit their opponents through obscure sculptures tricky questions and insightful guessing the game has two fun phases sculpting and guessing in the first phase every player creates a cluzzle a clay puzzle from one of the subjects on a random game card then comes the guessing there are three rounds in which players ask yes no questions to figure out what you have created a good cluzzle is one that cannot be solved until several yes no questions have been asked in fact you get more points the longer it takes others to figure out your sculpture so why not make a horribly unrecognizable blob the kicker is that if your cluzzle is not correctly guessed by the end of the game then youll receive zero points for it a perfect cluzzle is one that is not immediately recognizable but also not too obscure cluzzle is a fast paced game filled with laughter and incredulous eye rolls as players fumble their way to deciphering your clay puzzle

1104953 the weight of evidence does not support a link between fluoride and intelligence quotient deficit
1104954 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
1104955 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health
1104956 the best way that the oda can get communities and politicians to stand up for water fluoridation is to provide in person a cogent and scientifically referenced defense of fluoridation at the afternoon forum
1104957 the best way to lower childrens fluoride intake as health canada suggests is to stop fluoridation
1104958 it makes no sense to prescribe fluoride drugs to children via the water supply at levels which are between 150 and 250 times higher than the level in mothers milk
1104959 today us airways is solidly on its way to fixing the mess
1104960 it took me six minutes to walk here the bag was on the belt most of the time its a 15 to 20 minute delay from when the plane lands
1104961 this was definitely much improved in the past ive waited two hours or they lost my luggage coming back just from a simple flight from boston this is a very favorable experience ive seen improvement
1104962 had 19 mishandled bag reports per 1 000 passengers in philadelphia for the three months ending june 30 compared to 39 a year earlier according to the u s department of transportation nationwide the airlines rating improved from below average to above average
1104963 detailed us airways chronic baggage problems in an article showing that demoralized workers decrepit equipment and revolving door management had crippled the baggage handling system
1104964 after the report us airways spent more than 20 million on everything from new baggage equipment to more airport service workers and managers and it began to attack the other part of the mishandled baggage problem chronic delays in flight departures and arrivals when flights dont leave or arrive on time luggage often gets lost or waylaid between planes
1104965 we have come a long way but we still have a long way to go
1104966 how can one airline with big congested hubs run on time while other major carriers stumble us airways rallied its work force to focus on one goal getting planes pushed back from the gate on time and began offering financial incentives to workers for better service
1104967 is spending about 50 million to fix its operation upgrading equipment and software fixing computer problems that resulted from its merger with america west airlines hiring new management and airport workers reworking how planes and crews are scheduled and building a crucial new baggage screening area in philadelphia

1104986 the lack of adequate hostel provision and the shocking increase in waiting lists for social housing reflect the failure of the state to understand this complex problem it is alarming that the most vulnerable women are faced with the unenviable choice of squatting sleeping rough or relying on family or friends for accommodation a big part of this problem stems from labours failure to build enough housing in every category over the last decade
1104987 this report underestimates the true numbers because it only includes those accepted by councils as a priority many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted those who ask for help are not always accepted as a priority and dont make any lists this is a largely hidden problem which these numbers only touch upon
1104988 councils have to take more responsibility for these vulnerable people yes we need more houses but the government has to be more creative with the private sector if we are ever going to meet housing needs
1104989 it has been virtually impossible for councils to build new homes because they cant borrow money on the open market
1104990 last year was the first time since 1983 that we built more social houses than were lost through right to buy our recent housing bill and the creation of the homes and communities agency will help to deliver council homes more quickly and will make it easier for councils to build their own social housing to meet the needs

1105098 the situation has not changed tottenham offered us 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal

1105100 he needed to make a little cash and thats how he chose to do it
1105101 when you put a steak in front of a starving man theres only so long before hes going to grab onto it
1105102 if the city doesnt use it to recycle ill use it
1105103 this isnt a case of grand theft or dealing in stolen property but a possible case of abandon property that he had every legal right to take advantage of
1105104 he was doing a civic duty by collecting that scrap aluminum and trying to sell it
1105105 hey this is me for anyone who cares to notice
1105106 unsere sucht nach l zu durchbrechen ist eine der gr ten herausforderungen der unsere generation je gegen berstehen wird
1105107 in my kingdom they will not have a word for madness they will simply call it power
1105108 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1105109 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes youll get punished for them
1105110 no one wants to go to jail but like i said youve got to learn from your mistakes you get punished for them i did what i had to do just to get through this
1105111 it should be over with after the second 30 days all of this comes from the juvenile thing
1105112 i went to court about it and thats just what was said
1105113 of course its always going to be in the back of your head

1105118 our church was set afire as two elderly people were asleep therein
1105119 there is evidence that hatred of our religion was the motivation in part at least
1105120 first of all id really like to apologize to the orginization to the coaches to my teammates to my family
1105121 we dont oppose the olympics but its wrong for them to demolish our house its wrong

1105123 saddened at the loss of life and injuries caused by the attack and extend our condolences to the victims and their families
1105124 especially in the vast countryside heavily populated by uighurs the chinese government has rolled out a political movement without end or reason that is unbearable to the uighur peasantry the entire uighur people live in a blanket state of fear
1105125 as que no queda otro camino que el de la protesta
1105126 im looking to do something different that the sport has never seen
1105127 i have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to play basketball as a student athlete at ut martin and spend 35 years as a coach at ut knoxville
1105128 i appreciate every opportunity both schools have given me and hope this gift will afford other young women the same opportunities
1105129 pat is an amazing asset for the university of tennessee
1105130 far beyond her obvious achievements as a coach she is a role model a leader a champion for academics and graduation and i cannot imagine a single individual who has done more to contribute to the success and the respect of womens athletics in this country
1105131 everything you wanted to know about gay pornstars but were afraid to ask
1105132 despite these very serious topics the show manages to show us the lighter sides of these hunky entertainers some of whom have very interesting and uplifting stories to tell
1105133 everything you wanted to know about gay pornstars but were afraid to ask
1105134 being buttwoman was very special to me because i aspire to be the best and when i was told elegant angel wanted me to be the next buttwoman i was very excited
1105135 after watching some of the past buttwomen i felt a little intimidated because the series is so unique and special who would know that the very thing i refused to be open minded about anal sex would feel so good its time for me to take over the big booty torch i really enjoyed the anal scene i was relaxed and im looking forward to seeing how my enjoyment is portrayed on camera each scene brought a new feeling and reaction out of me it was truly a fun time
1105136 everything about her is so hot it was her time to shine she tries new things in this movie its almost like shes coming out of her shell
1105137 we pay a lot of attention to this particular series because its a hallmark of the company we filmed lots of great visuals great tease and great sex in this movie
1105138 the right to be left alone profiles a man you dont have to like to find worth heeding
1105139 and a man you may like more than you might have expected
1105140 we figure that freedom of the press is only important if its offensive
1105141 if were not gonna offend anybody we dont need protection of the first amendment
1105142 trade shows are so important to the expansion of my business as well as meeting and greeting my fans in person
1105143 appearing live at adult and fetish oriented events helps establish a relationship with my customers that could potentially last a lifetime
1105144 being exposed to various distributors wholesalers and producers to conduct business on future collaborative projects on a regular basis each year contributes highly to the visibility of my top quality dvd product and my companys brand name
1105145 we know customers are facing tough times in this economy
1105146 we know customers are facing tough times in this economy
1105147 sisterhood of the traveling pants 2 premiere party causing them to leave
1105148 i grew up watching lindsay and it made me want to do what she does
1105149 just the whole vibe being there being on camera or onstage with everybody listening to you its so cool when people look up to you
1105150 so bad you dont even know and now its actually happening ive already been asked for my autograph and its just a really good feeling to have
1105151 train wreck seems to be the route to fame in that family
1105152 when you grow up in front of the camera and youre young you just want to please the adults around you that trumps all the natural developmental stages a child should go through
1105153 your sense of self gets fused with the fact that youre playing a role when theres no more role theres no sense of self that can leave you empty unable to self regulate and vulnerable to substance abuse
1105154 lindsays gotten so much attention for the negative that it makes sense that ali might try to do the negative things as well
1105155 yeah he said theres a place you can get some do you know what he is talking about
1105156 he said look ive got to get up im going to walk out of here
1105157 he has to take care of his business and get himself right and get back here
1105158 i dont know if you can tarnish what hes done on the field
1105159 off the field is a completely different issue on the field i dont know how you can tarnish that i know when i line up to play against him i wont be thinking about him holding out i will be thinking about making sure i have tight coverage on the guys when hes in the pocket or when he scrambles because if i dont he has a cannon to get the ball to the receivers thats what ill be thinking about
1105160 my coach paul butzen was the co founder of the fond du lac running club in 1979 and served as president of the club and youth director on and off from 1979 until the time of his death in 2004
1105161 paul was even named rrca race director of the year in 1989 this is how i got started in running because the club had such a well established youth program
1105162 what ive noticed over the years is that sometimes with your consistent training and racing you can in a way serve as a silent leader to other individuals whether its people you already know or people who just know of you when others notice a certain individual who trains a lot is listed in race results at the same events year after year or just being noticed for their accomplishments on a regular basis it can become contagious to other people even without knowing or talking to other people some might notice what i do as a runner whether its my training racing promotion of the sport etc and it might motivate them to excel in their own individual right if there is a contest within your training group or club a fund raiser connected with an event or something as common as a local road race etc be a part of it and participate dont be quick to count yourself out based on your ability level or try to judge whether youll be good at it or not or whether you like or dislike the type of competition it is or who the other people are that are participating or the awards given out for it etc but instead participate to be a part of something challenge yourself make it fun make it your own meet new people through the activity compete dont compare as runners at the end of the day we are mostly individuals who are running for ourselves we dont do it for anyone else most of us do it because we love it we all have our own reasons for why we run so you might as well make it fun and be a part of the things that are going on in your community club etc
1105163 there are very high expectations for this team healthy quarterback he looks great very fast defense much more athletic on offense and im very excited about a lot of things
1105164 part of the reason im really pumped up about this season is we have a real healthy donovan mcnabb who looks great out there
1105165 were very used to succeeding on significant level and it is disappointing when we dont or cant we approach every season with very high expectations this isnt about rebuilding or retooling this is going for it thats our approach its pedal to the medal thats what every move is based on
1105166 you think you put together an outstanding team thats going to go very far but sometimes you have to understand that youre not going to have the players on the field that you expect to be on the field that happens in this sport
1105167 my philosophy and i think the organizations philosophy is just to try to always be fair
1105168 were the distribution mechanism for these 53 players you try to be fair and do contracts when they make sense for the team and youre trying to spread it out the best you can so you can have the best possible roster at the same time you want to be fair to every single player i just think theres a sense of fairness we try to uphold but you cant always succeed at it
1105169 i try to be positive about every single player on the roster and i dont get involved in the press about agents nor do i deal directly with agents so im not even going to address that
1105170 i will say i hope lito has a terrific season and shows us and the league that hes back to the old lito and healthy with great playmaking ability and i think thats what hes going to do
1105171 other players get reps and improve and thats the game of football
1105172 weve got to prepare hes been hurt before so weve had to prepare any way im hopeful shawn will have a terrific season and things will work themselves out
1105173 weve had two days of two live periods so there has been a lot of banging on the guys
1105174 good those teenage drivers are a danger on the road
1105175 for the first six months of being licensed teenagers will be prohibited from driving from midnight 5 a m unless the teen is accompanied by a licensed driver who is 25 or older
1105176 a new passenger limit for the first six months of being licensed allows only one passenger under age 20 unless accompanied by a parent or guardian for the next six months no more than three passengers under age 20 are permitted unless accompanied by a parent or guardian
1105177 the contest is really a reflection of what we ultimately want our corporate responsibility report to do and to be
1105178 we think the reports real purpose should be not so much to summarize the ways were working to become a better company as it is to provide a concrete lead that people can follow we really want it to serve as a catalyst for change and act as a tool that companies can use to improve their own systems and practices its got a lot to say about all the possibilities that are out there and i think having our readers and peers tell us how to spread that word is the best way to get the report to create the kind of impacts we want it to have
1105179 we must treat every suspicious item the same and utilize the tools we have available to make a final determination
1105180 procedures are in place for a reason and this is a clear indication our workforce is doing a great job
1105181 and this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who doesnt know better the rule just doesnt work
1105182 and in todays passengers fight back world do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb
1105183 thousands of dollars in excessive compensation for airfare hotels mileage and personal cell phone calls
1105184 activities that cannot withstand public scrutiny without embarrassment do not safeguard the public trust in the integrity of mndot and undermine public trust in the department
1105185 ive been talking about electronic medical records during my whole campaign
1105186 i think that we need to have changes to the health care system
1105187 each one of us needs to have electronic medical records
1105188 when we go to a hospital or community health center we ought to be able to access our own medical records so that a physician knows what sort of drugs were taking and what are the latest x rays and cat scans weve had so we dont have to do the same test over and over again
1105189 will just about fell over dead when he saw her
1105190 we got out of the car and he said to me come on over its kay hagan
1105191 we support kay because shell get higher pay for teachers and want a greater focus on education from the federal level
1105192 it must have been me there are no ghosts running about the house who would have done that
1105193 c program files adobe photoshop album starter edition 3 2 apps apdproxy exe
1105194 c program files dell support center gs agent custom dsca exe
1105195 only about one fourth of all medical schools in the us require medical students to take even one nutrition course less than half of medical programs even provide an elective nutrition course students in such classes receive less than twenty total hours of nutrition education an amount they themselves consider inadequate
1105196 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
1105197 i think thats when you need to have the right guys in the locker room being leaders
1105198 im embracing the fact that i think im one of them and i know muhsin muhammads embracing that fact and i know jon beason and chris harris are embracing that fact too and we are spreading it amongst ourselves theres open communication
1105199 i think the leaders on this team will have to do a good job of keeping this team together keeping unity on this team and keeping guys feeling like they have an equal voice and that theres just camaraderie
1105200 i think thats the most important thing just having camaraderie
1105201 this will not divide this football team i promise you
1105202 me and steve have talked man to man and one on one we still have some more talking to do as far as the descrepencies of what we feel like are the issues between us but were going to handle it as men
1105203 the suspect was only in the store for a matter of seconds maybe a minute but not very long at all
1105204 we dont know exactly how long it was that the clerk was in there before the customer found him
1105205 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1105206 when a man stands between two choices to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza
1105207 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working directly with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling
1105208 it was less efficient than having the planes electronic transmission locator working but more efficient than not having any information
1105209 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff
1105210 we need to restructure our debt and bring our capital structure in line with todays market place realities
1105211 we believe chapter 11 provides the most efficient and timely process for accomplishing this
1105212 a unique vehicle to take advantage of the current market disarray
1105213 well still vote labour because we think they will stick up for us better than the others but were open to offers
1105214 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1105215 this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1105216 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1105217 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1105218 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than 1 million from big oil just last month
1105219 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1105220 if the best defense is a good offense then i am more than willing to offend my enemies
1105221 attorneys for a former florida college professor who pleaded guilty two years ago to aiding palestinian islamic jihad sami al arian are asking a federal judge to hold a hearing on whether anti muslim bias led to the governments decision to obtain a new indictment of al arian in june for contempt for refusing to testify before grand juries pursuing the virginia organizations while the motion claims muslim terrorism suspects are generally treated unfairly by the justice department lawyers argue that mr kromberg 51 has a particularly egregious record of intemperate statements and actions in a series of terrorism related cases and investigations
1105222 they can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset
1105223 all part of the attempted islamization of the american justice system
1105224 if you are a kaffir timimi believes in time of war hes supposed to lie to you
1105225 kromberg argued to the jury that timimi and the other muslim witnesses their testimony should be disregarded just on the basis of their religion
1105226 i think its an outrageous thing to argue in the courtroom imagine that directed at any other religion
1105227 muslims are permitted to lie 1 to save their lives 2 to reconcile a husband and wife 3 to persuade a woman into a bedroom and 4 to facilitate one on his journey muslims are even permitted to disavow islam and mohammed if it is not a genuine heart felt rejection muslims will tell you that concealment of a truth is not an abandonment of that truth if it benefits islam
1105228 would be outraged to know she was not given that right of first refusal
1105229 she is the only woman in history who has ever garnered this much support
1105230 she is the only woman in history who was able to raise the kind of money one would need to run a presidential campaign
1105231 i would be very concerned about his judgment if he offered the position to another woman before offering it to hillary clinton
1105232 the women who have been elected to office in this time in history are the beneficiaries of the womens movement
1105233 and its disheartening to see those same women turn their backs on another woman who is better qualified and one can only wonder what they are getting out of their decision to turn their back
1105234 there are a lot of women apoplectic at the discussion of bob barr and chuck hagel
1105235 it seems like the smart choice will be to pick hillary clinton because she adds so much to the ticket but the second choice should be a nominee who supported hillary clinton to try and bring the sides together
1105236 alexander isayevich solzhenitsyns entire life was devoted to the fatherland
1105237 he served the fatherland like a genuine citizen and patriot
1105238 his works changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think about past and present in a different way
1105239 about the dead one should say only good things or nothing at all
1105240 he criticized the west more than putin and lost touch with thinking russian people
1105241 he was a great personality with a lot of contradictions who ultimately became an isolated figure
1105242 this is not the man who could have written the gulag archipelago his is the position of a soviet retrograde
1105243 he was a great comrade a person who stood up against the government
1105244 even during the worst times of his life he acted slyly succeeding in extracting benefits even from the negative like when the usa gave him the nobel prize
1105245 the ideological death of solzhenitsyn took place the night after the soviet union fell in 1991
1105246 what came after was a sort of life after death
1105247 marriage is being imposed on everyone whether they like it or not
1105248 take the case of a woman in her 50s who has not worked for 20 years and has raised the children
1105249 she is deserted by her de facto husband who earns half a million dollars a year currently the court looks only at her contribution during the past 20 years rather than her future financial needs in the division of property that is not the case with a married woman
1105250 i came into the relationship with a certain amount and i dont want to make money out of it
1105251 as long as i am secure and my children are ok i dont feel its right to make demands of him
1105252 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1105253 the area that is causing some concern is that although its asian growth is good it is slower than it was and if you extrapolate from that then growth is going to be really slow
1105254 you people arent relating to me any more youve lost me

1105259 this suggests that the deceased may have been alive somewhere in the south wairarapa in or about 1742
1105260 we know the deceased was possibly a european female and likely aged between 40 and 45 years
1105261 a moment of random violence erupts in an ordinary los angeles diner
1105262 i just wanted to thank you for the evening both leon and i had a good time even in spite of my initial nervousness you have a wonderful talent at helping people to just be themselves and creating a relaxed atmosphere i wanted you to know i really appreciate that im very happy that you will be the person behind the camera at our wedding

1105266 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1105267 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1105268 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1105269 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1105270 you dont have to reinvent the wheel heres the wheel

1105272 how silly to think hiding your face in a curb will protect you from a nuclear blast
1105273 oh fudge the bomb and i hadnt even unpacked the deviled eggs nothing for it but to hide under this plate

1105279 suggestions for how best to recreate a fiscally sound nation for future generations
1105280 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1105281 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1105282 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1105283 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1105284 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1105285 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1105286 i dont want to save the planet i just want to inhabit it as comfortably as possible for as lengthy as i have
1105287 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1105288 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1105289 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1105290 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1105291 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1105292 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1105293 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1105294 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1105295 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1105296 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water

1105301 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
1105302 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
1105303 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1105304 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1105305 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1105306 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1105307 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1105308 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1105309 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1105310 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1105311 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1105312 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1105313 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1105314 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1105315 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1105316 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1105317 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1105318 if life gives you lemons throw em back to the s o b that gave em to you and grab a beer
1105319 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1105320 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
1105321 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1105322 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1105323 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1105324 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1105325 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1105326 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1105327 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1105328 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1105329 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1105330 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1105331 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1105332 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1105333 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1105334 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1105335 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1105336 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1105337 but it seems as if you are showing disrespect for the contributions service and sacrifice of the american soldier
1105338 i was going to say that our soldiers were doing an extraordinary job
1105339 the line of course is that politics makes strange bedfellows
1105340 they are trying to scare americans by engaging in character assassination
1105341 i need to speak personally about mccain raising the question of whether obama is a risky guy it has nothing to do with his name or skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment with his unreadiness sic to be president he made a personal insult to john mccain i know john mccain this man doesnt have a bigoted bone in his body it was just wrong for senator obama to have done that and it was right for the campaign to call him out in it
1105342 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion i urge barack obama to have some faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or race
1105343 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1105344 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1105345 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1105346 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1105347 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1105348 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1105349 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1105350 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1105351 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1105352 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1105353 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
1105354 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
1105355 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
1105356 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1105357 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1105358 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1105359 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
1105360 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
1105361 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1105362 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1105363 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1105364 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1105365 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1105366 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1105367 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
1105368 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
1105369 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1105370 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
1105371 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
1105372 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
1105373 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1105374 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
1105375 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
1105376 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
1105377 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1105378 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1105379 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1105380 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1105381 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1105382 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1105383 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1105384 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1105385 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1105386 only a handful of people in the world are doing what were doing here
1105387 were pushing the boundaries and looking at nature in a new way
1105388 there isnt an answer in the back of the book
1105389 this is a realistic view of research which is not often glamorous its rolling up sleeves for time intensive tasks
1105390 were looking for interesting patterns which might shed light on the role of the stratosphere in the earths weather
1105391 in a science lab you usually operate within fixed parameters but the real world is subject to change you wont find this in a textbook
1105392 its important for christians to be involved in this type of scientific research
1105393 a christian scientist with credentials can have a powerful impact in the world
1105394 we look forward to developing strong relationships with dealers here
1105395 exeter finance brings something different to this market our underwriting and verification teams work right here at the branch not thousands of miles away in a centralized facility because of our local presence dealers will enjoy personalized service from people they already know and trust
1105396 im john mccain an i totally sold out on every principle that made john mccain showed up to a junior high school kegger that i was at
1105397 hey youre not in junior high school what are you doing here
1105398 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1105399 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1105400 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1105401 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1105402 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1105403 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1105404 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1105405 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1105406 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1105407 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1105408 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1105409 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1105410 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1105411 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1105412 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1105413 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1105414 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1105415 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1105416 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1105417 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1105418 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1105419 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1105420 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1105421 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1105422 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1105423 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1105424 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1105425 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1105426 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1105427 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1105428 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1105429 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1105430 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1105431 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1105432 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1105433 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1105434 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1105435 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1105436 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1105437 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1105438 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1105439 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1105440 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1105441 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1105442 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1105443 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1105444 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1105445 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1105446 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1105447 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1105448 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1105449 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1105450 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1105451 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1105452 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1105453 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1105454 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1105455 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1105456 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1105457 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1105458 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1105459 wir sind bereingekommen dass wir in diesem fall keine andere wahl haben werden als neue sanktionen zu beschlie en
1105460 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1105461 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1105462 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1105463 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1105464 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1105465 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1105466 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1105467 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1105468 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1105469 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1105470 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1105471 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1105472 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1105473 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1105474 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1105475 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1105476 a lot of people come just to get out of the heat
1105477 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1105478 we certainly understand why people are so surprised to see
1105479 at bottom obama is about taxing wealth creation not the piles of cash these guys have already accumulated
1105480 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1105481 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1105482 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1105483 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1105484 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1105485 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1105486 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1105487 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1105488 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1105489 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1105490 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1105491 a lot of people come just to get out of the heat
1105492 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1105493 we certainly understand why people are so surprised to see
1105494 at bottom obama is about taxing wealth creation not the piles of cash these guys have already accumulated
1105495 voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger
1105496 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1105497 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1105498 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1105499 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1105500 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1105501 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1105502 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1105503 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1105504 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1105505 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1105506 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1105507 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1105508 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1105509 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1105510 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1105511 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
1105512 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
1105513 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
1105514 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
1105515 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
1105516 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will

1105529 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels

1105544 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1105545 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1105546 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1105547 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now

1105574 the big oil companies are wallowing in cash and exxon is the most aggressive in buying back its stock instead of taking the risks it should to both find new oil and develop new forms of energy
1105575 were investing in any project that we have ready for funding we do that first then the money thats earned in our business is the shareholders money and we return it to the shareholders
1105576 these oil companies cannot continue to earn these profits spend a pittance on renewable fuels to move america beyond oil and then block any efforts to shift billions in tax breaks to companies trying to bring about the next generation of clean energy
1105577 yes the oil companies are making some big profits when theyre not spending it to look for oil theyre paying it for dividends and who gets those dividends i suspect theyre americans americans who invest in pension funds

1105599 he taught me a lot that ive been able to retain
1105600 i mentioned to wayne that some of the terminology he used took me to the time i worked with warren i could almost close my eyes and hear him

1105609 the most striking thing about chevrons report was its executives webcast discussion of its available new oil and its progress or lack of it in producing that oil
1105610 its most immediate project is a nigerian oilfield expected to turn a handsome profit as one executive acknowledged while costlier projects in the gulf of mexico merited only vague predictions
1105611 these economic choices show the pointlessness of president bushs demand that currently off limits coastal areas be handed on a platter to oil companies while known large discoveries in the gulf of mexico go undrilled
1105612 the drill now drill everywhere campaign is a hoax on americans

1106035 this is a major strategic defeat for al qaeda because they declared iraq as their central front
1106036 certainly with the u s presence in iraq they felt that this was a vulnerability that they could exploit for their own purposes they needed the sunnis support to do that and that has failed
1106037 they believe intuitively that they are not going to be harmed that the probability is not there for them
1106038 so theyre on those streets with their families and children theyre there in the evenings to have some sort of social life
1106039 how are you going to deal with an iranian challenge at all if you start by taking what is now a tremendous setback we have imposed with our iraqi partners on iran
1106040 there is no question about whether the iraqi government wants to have a strategic partnership with the u s
1106041 from a pure geo strategic perspective it is insane to imagine that afghanistan is somehow more important than iraq

1106057 c music soundtrack false indicates whether to recurse directory structures during query evaluation defaults to true if not provided mediaextensions the list of file extensions to include in the search defaults to mp3 wma if not provided aside from using the musiclinq layer to process sql statements the only thing else that is done in this assembly is to provide an implementation of idataadapter and dbdatareader so that the results can be returned to an application as a system dataset that is all pretty straightforward and there are plenty of examples out there so i wont delve into the details the musiclinq layer this assembly has two main responsibilities retrieve any or all of the media tags from a set of files using the pass the sql command from the data provider layer to the sqllinq assembly and use the resulting parse tree to retrieve and evaluate the correct media tags as such it is the glue between the sql as text the sql as a parse tree and the physical data store represented by a collection of media files i started with some simple code that could read id3 v1 1 tags but wanted something a bit more robust asf container formats other id3 tag versions etc a bit of searching lead to the windows media format sdk and now the retrieval of the actual tag values is all done using wmvcore dll and the interfaces iwmmetadataeditor iwmmetadataeditor2 and iwmheaderinfo3 the code that performs this retrieval started its life as part of one the sdk samples its now modified to fit the needs of this application and my particular coding style as such i think it may be a bit more generically useful than the original sample as it doesnt do the same tag of formatting as it deserializes the tags except for byte arrays which are only return as string representation idicating their length if you are looking for some media tag access code check out the tagloader class in the attached code it should be pretty easy to yank out and bend to your needs the meat of retrieving the actual tags has a basic win32 flavor to it calling methods twice to get buffer sizes and then passing them back in to be filled null terminated strings etc if youve worked with windows apis at all nothing too surprising with this piece static iwmheaderinfo3 getheaderinfo string path iwmmetadataeditor editor wmfsdkfunctions wmcreateeditor out editor iwmmetadataeditor2

ilist represents the result set from the query with each idictionary being analogous to a single row the list of rows is how data is returned to provider layer the sqllinq layer this is where all the good linq y stuff happens sql parsing sql parsing started with a very simplistic approach using the was little more than a rudimentary tokenizer that got me as far as the simple select field from source part but not much farther a day or so of searching came up with nothing usable until i came upon the or gold application this thing started as devin cooks masters thesis and is really a remarkable tool what it does is take in the rules for an arbitrary language in bnf format and spits out a set of parse tables to be used later by a language specific state machine parse engine there are even a number of engines available in multiple languages including c this code uses a c engine by vladimir morozova which is included in the download there was even a specification for a simple sql syntax available extended slightly to add column aliases boolean literals and to allow having clauses to contain aggregate expressions there is also a nice that explains the gold application and its use in more depth basically this solved my problem perfectly and kudos to authors of the gold application parsing proceeds from the leaves to the trunk building up the parse tree along the way as the parser traverses tokens and rule it yields up a reduction rule which corresponds to the various parts of the language a custom attribute is used to map c classes to sql rules and instantiate them

1106154 our conference features experts who researched the dangers that fluoride poses to human health our keynote speaker dr a k susheela executive director fluorosis research and rural development foundation india probably knows more about fluorides toxic effects to the body than any other living scientist it is important that officials who promote water fluoridation hear what she and others have to say
1106155 these meetings will give the public information they dont get from our government or dental organizations in the afternoon a panel will address the question of whether toronto should stop fluoridating its water in the evening experts will explain fluorides dangers to health

1106195 sab a exactamente qui n era mosley mi marido gusta y es conocedor del mundo de la alta competici n del motor y era rico poderoso y exitoso
1106196 jam s en un mill n de a os habr amos pensado que esto causar a tantos problemas
1106197 nadie de ninguna organizaci n incluyendo el mi5 habl ni con mi marido ni conmigo misma antes o despu s de haber contactado con el peri dico fue todo decisi n nuestra y el resultado de un momento de locura
1106198 hacer un plano significa ser m s vulnerable a un pinchazo porque el neum tico se hace m s fino en esa rea y adem s tienes menos protecci n contra cualquier problema causado por restos en la pista
1106199 fui el nico que tuvo un pinchazo y fue algo as como oh no otra vez no
1106200 por el momento estoy relajado mi contrato tambi n es v lido para el a o que viene
1106201 por el momento no veo peligro el contrato es s lido y el equipo ha sido muy leal conmigo los pilotos actuales lo hemos hecho muy bien y creo que no hay raz n para que el equipo quiera cambiarnos
1106202 creo que todos los equipos quieren acuerdos de larga duraci n cualquier piloto tiene dif cil firmar por un a o pero si tienes un a o y lo haces bien luego se convierte en dos o tres a os depende de lo bien que lo hagas estoy seguro que el contrato con mclaren era de m s de un a o y al final dur solamente un a o
1106203 fernando es uno de los mejores pilotos de la f rmula 1 creo que
1106204 ha habido carreras este a o en las que he estado en disposici n de luchar por la victoria pero siempre hubo algo que me fue mal pero mediada la carrera de hoy las cosas han empezado a ir bien para m y he comenzado a presionar a felipe y finalmente ha funcionado lo siento por felipe porque ha hecho una gran carrera pero mi coche ha respondido bien y sab a que pod a luchar por la victoria este es un gran momento para m algo que desde hace muchos a os era mi objetivo espero que este triunfo sea el primero de muchos
1106205 felicidades a heikki por su primera y bien merecida victoria en un gran premio la carrera podr a haber sido mejor para m mi salida ha sido buena pero la de felipe ha sido mejor y me ha adelantado he conseguido mantener la distancia durante el primer stint y me he sentido c modo en el segundo porque estaba igualando sus tiempos y yo iba a alargar m s mi segunda parada ten a la sensaci n de que pod a adelantarle pero el pinchazo del neum tico ha frenado mis progresos no s qu ha pasado al menos he sumado cuatro puntos y mantengo mi liderato en el campeonato as que este resultado no est del todo mal para m
1106206 una de las frases m s antiguas del automovilismo dice que
1106207 es el d a que mas contento me voy de un circuito en este a o ya que ha sido una buena carrera he igualado mi mejor resultado del a o porque lo que hoy iguala al cuarto puesto en australia pero creo que all tuve mas suerte que en esta carrera aunque aqu haya abandonado massa y hamilton haya tenido ese problema con el pinchazo all estaba octavo a falta de veinte vueltas y de repente me puse cuarto o sea que aqu algo nos lo hemos merecido nosotros
1106208 aqu nos lo hemos ganado en la pista luchando de t a t con ferrari y pasando a k bica que estaba por delante de nosotros pero en la primera parada lo dejamos atr s si que se puede decir que es la primera carrera que estamos cerca de ellos y ha sido la mejor del a o sin dudas
1106209 la salida fue buena y podr a haber sido mejor de haber habido una recta mas larga aparte tuve que frenar para no tocarme con glock lo que empeor mi situaci n aunque la verdad no result todo tan mal ya que gan al menos una posici n all
1106210 no tenemos claro a n que lo de hacer rodar los neum ticos que bamos a usar en carrera fuese realmente efectivo lo cierto es que en el primer tramo de la misma con ruedas nuevas tuve buen ritmo pero luego veremos con mas detenimiento si esto ha sido una buena idea aunque algo pudo haber influido en nuestro mejor desempe o
1106211 en mi segunda parada estaba convencido de que iba a salir delante de raikkonen algo que pudimos hacer en la primera detenci n pero me sorprendi mucho ver que estaba algo as como 500 metros m s delante de m cuando sali de boxes unas vueltas antes de parar l se hab a salido un poquito y pens que con eso iba a ser suficiente pero no alcanz mis vueltas de entrada a pista luego de la detenci n fueron buenas y esa la segunda incluso fue mejor que la primera pero raikkonen sali delante tenemos que analizar muy bien lo que pas podr a haber tenido el podio al alcance de la mano
1106212 el coche fue mas f cil de conducir en esta carrera y eso me daba pi a que pudiese atacar en todas las curvas sin perder mucho tiempo aqu si te sales de la trayectoria pierdes mucho tiempo y luego no encuentras el ritmo
1106213 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out

1106217 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding
1106218 the only disappointing thing is that all of the people who donated to us were gay friends or couples
1106219 and so far none of our blood relatives or straight friends have actually contributed any money
1106220 we dont need another toaster or another set of silverware

1106230 although the previous handbook had chapters on healthy eating we have tried to make it more interesting this time by naming diets after the likes of aamir khan and sania mirza
1106231 nobody wants to read about the benefits of bhindi and tinda now they will at least go through the diets just for the sake of their idols
1106232 we want students to start liking vegetables and understand their health values so while students may not like tinda deepika dilbahar sounds much more exotic
1106233 instead of doing away with burgers and pizzas the adolescent programme has given detailed recipes of making them in a healthier manner

1106286 its not so bad for students to exert some of their own resources in funding higher education my view is they appreciate it more if they have to work for it
1106287 as i said in my original comment these studies arent conclusive they need to be duplicated
1106288 yet i think they are enough to indicate that you shouldnt assume all liberals are stupid
1106289 it is at least likely that they were conducted under proper scientific conditions to remove the affect of researcher bias
1106290 since they seem quite intelligent they are probably liberals based on the results of their own studies
1106291 the president does anyone who still doesnt believe in global warming just has their head in the sand but thats a different topic
1106292 catholic schools do tend to perform better than public schools which is not surprising since they also tend to have lower student to teacher ratios
1106293 however it does not necessarily follow that your catholic high school was one of the ones that performed higher than the average public school
1106294 therefore it also doesnt necessarily follow that being an honors student at your particular high school means that you are exceptionally smart
1106295 it also doesnt necessarily follow that being an honors student at your particular high school means that you are exceptionally smart im willing to give you the benefit of the doubt i believe youre intelligent
1106296 i simply dont believe that you have much in the way of critical thinking skills
1106297 i didnt presume anything the phrase to which your responding is a quote from the article to which i linked thats why there are quotation marks around it
1106298 stds are a huge problem in society but their spread is not caused by liberal thinking
1106299 its caused by promiscuity and a lack of prophylactic precaution

1106301 and yet the some of the most conservative people i know are also the most promiscuous
1106302 by linking liberal thinking with stds which only adds credance to my original comment
1106303 mensa there are a lot of strange people in it
1106304 but they dont all know how to use their intelligence
1106305 there is not a one to one correlation between iq and political orientation which is what your post implies
1106306 i dont know if you have friends but if you do youll understand
1106307 they stand for nothing other than getting people of like intelligence together on the other hand ive had rather amazing discussions with my fellow mensans
1106308 i mentioned my affiliation with mensa only to disprove your implication that all liberals were stupid
1106309 you have turned that around to mean that since mensans are stupid i am in fact stupid
1106310 if you believe that high iq academic and professional success financial security and a stable happy life are signs of low intelligence i have all of these things i am not bragging
1106311 im simply telling you that being a liberal doesnt preclude you from these things
1106312 youre proud that you spend your time baiting people into arguments
1106313 it seems a pretty sad way to spend your time actually
1106314 i dont really know why i felt like doing it today
1106315 people like you are too full of hate to think rationally
1106316 hey i got a uncle i hate he always wants to wrassle with the mule and he gets all wore out and the mule gets all wore out no come to think of it i dont hate him either
1106317 i guess i felt i needed to vent for which you have been very helpful
1106318 go on baiting people into one sided arguments based on fallacious premises

1106347 the olympic committee should have understood in the first place that censorship is a core strategy the chinese government uses to maintain control the ioc was naive to think china would relinquish that control if only for a week
1106348 it is very disappointing i am as disappointed in the ioc as i am in china
1106349 coming just nine days before the opening ceremony this is yet another provocation by the chinese authorities this situation increases our concern that there will be many cases of censorship during the games
1106350 we condemn the iocs failure to do anything about this and we are more than skeptical about its ability to ensure that the media are able to report freely
1106351 by continuing to persecute and punish those who speak out for human rights the chinese authorities have lost sight of the promises they made when they were granted the games seven years ago
1106352 the chinese authorities are tarnishing the legacy of the games
1106353 they must release all imprisoned peaceful activists allow foreign and national journalists to report freely and make further progress toward the elimination of the death penalty

1106372 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1106373 youd have to arrive at that decision by a logical means by the end of this year its shaping that way its being kicked around
1106374 we know they do great work already and we have some that we dont even know about thats going to come out because they have the opportunity to get some resources and collaborate with other groups

1106384 beyond the final score the politics of sport in asia
1106385 it acknowledges that chinas rise is not a zero sum game thats not denying the competitive aspects to the relationship but it is a broader template which coincides with the building of the new embassy
1106386 the completion of the two new embassies not only reflects the good shape of our relationship but also signals broad prospects for its further growth
1106387 a decade ago the bilateral issues were relatively well known taiwan human rights trade now chinas interests literally span the globe
1106388 the world is really riddled with export control measures now which makes the already difficult task of buying food in the present highly volatile and thin markets even more of a challenge
1106389 at a moment when again globally the availability of food is so much more limited
1106390 the problem is that the un general assembly can pass a resolution to this effect but it cannot enforce it if passed
1106391 the sharp domestic political pressures that lead politicians to adopt such short sighted and ultimately ineffective policies as export restrictions and export taxes will likely trump the gentle diplomatic pressure of un member states
1106392 humanitarian use exemptions are widely accepted by corporations with respect to licensing fees on patented technologies they forego revenues when the target user group are poor people the same principle can and should apply to government export duties on shipments for humanitarian uses in low income countries
1106393 knowing that this region is very prone to natural disaster i think there was a sense of urgency within the arf to move expeditiously and to be ready in the event the next disaster happens
1106394 military assets and personnel in full support and not in place of civilian responses have played an increasingly important role in regional disaster responses
1106395 there is no doubt that the deployment of military assets for disaster response and relief operations is beneficial
1106396 the more experience the militaries of the region have in dealing with these civilian matters the better they are in delivering in major events
1106397 the mandates and competencies of humanitarian and military organisations are different and should not be confused
1106398 were looking at maybe having a database of information what resources are available and can be deployed in an emergency from within arf countries
1106399 that night i went into labour in a small bamboo thatched house on the banks of the pyapon river to deliver my first child but as the wind roared my husband and i struggled outside only to see our home destroyed right before our very eyes
1106400 as the rain poured down and the water began to reach my chest my husband lifted me on to some floating debris as i lay there the labour pains became so painful i began to scream i needed help
1106401 finally among the broken pieces of wood i gave birth around six in the morning but almost died in the process i had lost so much blood both my husband and the woman who had helped me deliver thought i was gone but a single hope kept me hanging on that my son needed me
1106402 after the cyclone i thought the worst was over but finally i understood that the worst of our hardship bringing our lives back to where they were had only just begun
1106403 i hope he comes back soon i have so many debts to pay back and my son needs medical treatment
1106404 for medical fees i had to borrow some money from a local money lender at a high interest rate 30 percent per month
1106405 but there are no choices here you do what you need to do to survive not just for my sons medical bills but also food occasionally the local authorities bring rice to us but its never enough i still need to buy some rice as well as vegetables and other things for cooking
1106406 of course i know i shouldnt be borrowing money at such high interest rates but i dont know what else to do i feel i should thank her for allowing me to borrow the money given i have nothing to offer her in collateral
1106407 my husband earns just 30 a month and our debts far exceed that now donors
1106408 better to leave him propped in electric warm chair a continual exhibit an ever going on performance for gaping audiences and try again but especially try now when lights out and crowds herded off in the dark all threatened by one smile on a bullet there was need of cooger as he once was tall flame headed and something wicked this way comes what a mouthful

1106443 were taking care of those folks and we have for years but those numbers dont count in determining the money
1106444 part of our problem is to challenge the gay leaders in this state to challenge those who are already infected to use the best methods to not spread the virus

1106446 theres every reason for the donors to now respond generously
1106447 het rockart museum bracht ons in contact met de drukker die ons in natura sponsort
1106448 we have people who have mentioned they feel like their life is worth more if theyre dead quite frankly those who were living on the edge are way over the edge now
1106449 these are just ordinary people who because of various reasons such as gas going up it leaves them short for their other bills
1106450 we cant keep our shelves stocked in the food pantry
1106451 but were here for people thats what the salvation army does well do the best for people with the resources we have and the help of our community
1106452 our funding from churches is basically the same as it was 10 years ago but the need has increased drastically
1106453 we try to keep the children entertained while we interview the parents who are so distraught because the children feel this
1106454 they have no one to help and they have children to raise
1106455 were saying to them can you move back in with your parents
1106456 the only other thing we can suggest is that they contact legal aid services to see if there is help in keeping the home
1106457 we have a retired psychiatric social worker who volunteers and she has been very concerned about the mental state of some of our folks
1106458 and most of these individuals dont have insurance or the means to seek professional help
1106459 with gas prices so high low income families are having a hard time getting to and from their jobs that pay minimum wage
1106460 the higher cost of groceries on top of that is taking a toll their paychecks are not going up
1106461 if you have a little extra money each month when costs go up youre ok
1106462 but if you live on fixed incomes or work for minimum wage thats different
1106463 were in dire need of canned goods and food in general
1106464 the community has done a really good job of taking care of people
1106465 we dont see homeless people with backpacks generally but were starting to see them a lot of folks are living outside under bridges and at english park
1106466 whats making it especially difficult is that people who give to agencies that help are feeling tentative about giving as much
1106467 were definitely seeing an increased need and not as many resources
1106468 we turn away about 2 000 requests for services each year
1106469 its hard to escape the conclusion that a system thats supposed to help people who are hurting works instead to wear them down and outlast them
1106470 not everyone can fight back and many cant survive this system
1106471 you could have heard a pin drop in the room
1106472 you accumulate a tremendous amount of debt just trying to live

1106490 the findings highlight a crisis of humanitarianism in the post 9 11 world
1106491 international action aimed at assisting and protecting the most vulnerable is for the most part inextricably linked to a northern security and political agenda the so called global war on terror distorts humanitarian principles and undercuts humanitarian effectiveness
1106492 there seems to be lots of talk about accountability for beneficiaries and listening to the voice of communities
1106493 but theres still a major disconnect between what is provided and what the local peoples aspirations are the northern agencies need to listen more and preach less
1106494 if al qaeda leader osama bin laden was situated in eastern drc it would receive a lot more resources
1106495 the voice of beneficiaries in humanitarian response is under threat its always been under threat thats more so now in a post 9 11 world
1106496 the war on terror has complicated our work theres no question
1106497 we see it as a very dangerous precedent when the military seems to be becoming very much more involved in humanitarian response and that makes our job a lot harder people are pushed together and that puts our staff in danger

1106508 an 8 000 funeral suddenly has a 562 tax added onto it
1106509 sure id like a property tax cut but im a property owner second im a father of four daughters in bay district schools first
1106510 but this is a net tax increase not a cut
1106511 youre swapping a property tax which is unfair to many property owners to a consumerbased tax so youre only taxed on what you use the less i consume the less i pay
1106512 it lowers values for all property owners from 30 to 40 percent depending on the exemptions you have
1106513 reducing the employment magnet is the linchpin of a comprehensive strategy to deter unlawful migration

1106516 everybody is looking for earlier and earlier signs of the disease

1106519 since there is no intervention that can change the chances of developing the disease for ethical reasons we dont disclose the findings
1106520 if you can help someone drive again youre giving them their life back
1106521 we want to help them understand whats happening to their body and give them tips on how to overcome that
1106522 a lot of family members dont want to be the ones to take away mom or dads keys
1106523 theres a population out there that doesnt know these services are available and if they are aware they might be very afraid

1106537 the u s has always been a net importer of seafood
1106538 we have always imported quite a bit of seafood but not to the extent we are bringing in now
1106539 now it has been turned over to the fda they will follow up with distributors and do any trace backs they find

1106542 floridas commercial fishing industry is probably 25 percent of what it was in its heyday in the 70s and 80s
1106543 we dont have near the infrastructure we had 20 years ago its just gone
1106544 commercial fishing was real big in palm beach county when i was a kid there were seven fish houses in riviera beach in the 60s
1106545 over time the fishing changed it went away and was replaced by high dollar businesses and condos
1106546 i like to use florida seafood but it is getting harder and harder it takes years to find the right people
1106547 my dolphin is caught locally my yellowtail is out of the keys my grouper is from the gulf the west coast i use key west wild caught pink shrimp
1106548 a thorough investigation determined that the driver and passengers were law abiding citizens of iraq
1106549 we now know there were no weapons in the car and there were not any shell casings
1106550 several corrective measures to amend and eliminate the possibility of such situations happening in the future
1106551 to see if they are meeting needs of the current environment
1106552 the agencys time there has not been a happy story
1106553 there have been thousands of units of affordable housing developed and a substantial investment made in the community but those things are in no way envisioned as making up for the damage that was done in the early days
1106554 there is no way to make up for clearing large swaths of land and displacing thousands of people
1106555 the agency would go to a house and give the head of household a certificate that said they would be given preference in housing built in the future
1106556 but there wasnt a lot of housing built for a long time
1106557 people say black folks chose to sell their homes but thats not true
1106558 we couldnt get loans to fix up the houses so we didnt have a choice but to sell or crumble there was a mean spiritedness that occurred during the entire process
1106559 the united states and the international community have tried to win the struggle in afghanistan with too few military forces and insufficient economic aid
1106560 why help the united states in afghanistan the european logic goes when america would be able to handle afghanistan much more easily if its gis werent bogged down in iraq
1106561 on one convoy last year we were 40 vehicles and only 12 got through

1106563 maybe we will lose 30 per cent of us this spring maybe 60 per cent
1106564 how concerned are you that israel may undertake a unilateral strike against iran by the end of the year
1106565 my strong preference here is to handle all of this diplomatically with the other powers of governments ours and many others as opposed to any kind of strike occurring
1106566 this is a very unstable part of the world and i dont need it to be more unstable
1106567 ive been pretty clear before that from the united states perspective the united states military perspective in particular that opening up a third front right now would be extremely stressful on us
1106568 that doesnt mean we dont have capacity or reserve but that would really be very challenging and also the consequences of that sometimes are very difficult to predict
1106569 but specifically that would be need to be led obviously politically and diplomatically
1106570 and if it then resulted in military to military dialogue i think that part of it certainly could add to a better understanding of each other
1106571 we havent had much of a dialogue with the iranians for a long time
1106572 it takes two people to want to have a dialogue not just the desire on one part
1106573 we demand the best for our children even if you dont
1106574 you guys at ugotnerve have it all wrong about fred morton he is not a racist he is a equal opportunity bully i found that it does not matter what race color religion title sex or creed you are he will abuse and misuse anyone that challenges him like most bullies he cannot face anyone one on one that is why he never responded to that teacher in henrico because she could take him on one on one but he is far too cowardly to take her or anyone else on when he is challenged i know from experience with him and brad king i feel like you insult racist people when you call morton one at least racist people focus on race as the primary reason for their hatred and violent actions fred morton is and always has been a sad scared little man that wants to be so important so powerful so in charge but does not want to work for it and is envious of those that do and can work for it he is the worse type of bully because he only picks on those that he thinks are unable to fight back like children parents and teachers morton was a bully as a child and grew up to be a bully now the board members of henrico are a pitiful bunch too not only are they bullies too but they help morton to be a bully i thought that henrico had a anit bully policy i guess that it only applies to children if it were not for the other teachers parents board members and administrators that stood up in montgomery bully fred would have gotten all of us the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him in numbers and run him out of town if the parents teachers and administrators of henrico county public schools do that then bully fred will run out of town with his tail between his legs never to return again
1106575 this is a signal to our residents that we will make sure we have an excellent library system
1106576 i was walking in the woods following the signal with my receiver trying to find the turtle and i walked into an area where some large trees had fallen down
1106577 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there
1106578 but as im walking i could see a patch of bare soil that didnt look quite right and when i got closer i could tell it had been cleared and some plants had been planted they looked like theyd been grown somewhere else and then actually replanted in the park
1106579 theyre being put on buses and sent all around the city no consent from the parents absolutely nothing
1106580 theres a limit in a summer program as to how much due process you can give

1106715 the g8 will take concrete steps to work toward improving the link between hiv aids activities and sexual and reproductive health and voluntary family planning programmes to improve access to health care including preventing mother to child transmission and to achieve the mdgs united nations millennium development goals by adopting a multisectoral approach and by fostering community involvement and participation
1106716 there is still no indication of who will pay up and exactly when
1106717 the proposals for strengthening health services are also seen by actionaid as flawed unless more is done to stem the exodus of skilled staff from african countries
1106718 training more health workers is pointless if the brain drain continues
1106719 there are more malawian doctors in the city of manchester than in the whole of malawi
1106720 its good progress that they will provide the promised levels of funding
1106721 however we hope they will fulfil these pledges because one of the big problems with health funding is lots of money promised and only part of it ever being paid
1106722 the g8 and other leaders of the developed world usually work on a political timetable so their funding is suited to when they arrive and exit office not around the needs of the people they are targeting
1106723 the other problem with hiv aids funding is that it rarely reaches the people who need it most who are at the community level
1106724 research shows that in africa more than 70 percent of the work in the hiv field is done by community based organisations but only 11 percent of the funding goes to them
1106725 in addition the organisations the money goes to have to meet strict standards usually only large international organisations without a good idea of the landscape in which they are working can meet the criteria so the money winds up being spent where it is not needed
1106726 its no wonder that despite all the funding the response is still lagging behind the epidemic

1106734 they dont seem to hear or respond to my questions very often in class

1106772 useful balm applied at the right moment to tense muscles
1106773 it is sending a soothing message dont make target setting a make or break issue in the talks as action to cut emissions is more important
1106774 cutting emissions will cost money but may not cost as much as is thought perhaps less than the current oil price spike for instance developing countries have to be involved but this is also where emission cuts are cheapest in this respect it the report is useful and important
1106775 and what would really make a difference is if he could use his special relationship with george bush to shift the us out of its anti kyoto stance
1106776 how to address the current i wont if you dont mentality in un negotiations
1106777 the bigger developing nations are understandably reluctant to make commitments at least until they have convincing evidence that the developed nations have set themselves on a low carbon pathway and are prepared to offer substantial financial incentives for global decarbonisation
1106778 for instance the report suggests that developing nations rather than take on binding reduction targets could produce action plans in which they detail how reductions might be achieved these initiatives and investments could then be supported by finance from developed countries
1106779 we have 10 to 15 years left in which the global emissions have to peak and decline the world is at a crossroads where decisive action now could translate into economic success
1106780 the problem today is not one of political will the political dilemma is not whether but how there are good grounds for making this assumption the attitude of countries like china and india is no longer you the wealthy created this challenge you can solve it they know climate change is our problem not yours
1106781 plenty if not all of the hows are already understood
1106782 for instance there are some very easy under exploited opportunities for societies to be more energy efficient but because there is a lack of political will or perhaps political space is a better way of putting it to come to an agreement which is intensified by high food and oil prices even many of these easy opportunities to act are not being taken up
1106783 some will say that to have a reasonable chance of constraining warming to approximately 2 c we need greenhouse gas concentration to peak at 500 parts per million by volume ppmv some at 450 ppmv some even less some insist that 2020 is the latest peaking moment we can permit beyond which damage to the climate will become irreversible some though generally not in the scientific community say 2025 or even 2030 may be permissible
1106784 this date is decades away and decades beyond the political life of any government
1106785 the key challenge is to describe a realistic pathway to it that implies shorter term goals but these are immensely demanding asking developed economies to move from growth in emissions to significant cuts within 10 to 15 years
1106786 within that i believe the g8 countries should lead with reductions of 80 percent to 95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050
1106787 it seems very clear now that developing countries including south africa are willing to sign up to this as a package but that depends on financial and technology transfer very clearly spelt out in bali
1106788 the problem lies with the us and japan who are unwilling to take on credible mid term targets
1106789 the vast majority of new power stations in china and india will be coal fired not may be coal fired will be so developing carbon capture and storage technology is not optional it is literally of the essence
1106790 it considers three options auctioning a proportion of emissions permits taxing emissions and increasing overseas development assistance
1106791 certainly there needs to be very good and clear plans of action from countries an exercise least developed countries have already gone through although probably not to the required depth and there needs to be timely and additional financing to underwrite these plans and also a very good mechanism to link the two

1106806 at the core of this the collective bargaining agreement allows for the individual teams to negotiate with their own players and pay bonuses as they see fit the league has stepped in and determined their own figures and theyve told the teams not to negotiate with their own players
1106807 overwhelmed by the beauty of the human in front of them

1106814 adapt to heaven and enjoy ease oppose it and toil in vain none can deduct from the reckoning or force what is fated
1106815 its the fool who plays it cool by making his world a little colder
1106816 chris the scope of your world is so large you just take it upon yourself to learn everything about it and thats wonderful
1106817 ich habe fehler gemacht und dinge getan von denen ich mir im nachhinein w nsche er w re nicht so aber ich habe nie ein k nguru getreten
1106818 i am alpha i am omega i am the beginning and the end
1106819 at the end of the day its still a bag
1106820 in meiner stra e gibt es keine d cher und keine fensterl den mehr
1106821 eine solche menge kommt sonst im ganzen monat august zusammen
1106822 i can assure you that what maybe humanitarian organisations are not thinking about but should be is exactly what the corporate sector is thinking about and doing very very well
1106823 one cannot predict the future but one can be sensitive to the dynamics of change and far more sensitive to what might be and in a sense that requires a whole institutional construct that the un has to consider
1106824 its not nostradamus its not all about gloomy situations what is so exciting about our age are the opportunities scientific and technological as well as social scientific towards finding an innovation that can and must be applied to the way we think in the future
1106825 it was known that many international agencies had been waiting for years to get access to myanmar
1106826 there will be few if any humanitarian crisis events that will not have synchronistic multiple cascading or global local dimensions
1106827 the single humanitarian crisis agent still reflected in much of the present public reportage and to some extent even in humanitarian organisations preparedness and response activities is increasingly a characteristic of the past
1106828 in light of these transformations it is all the more surprising that some of the most important organisations presently responsible for preventing preparing for and responding to the sorts of humanitarian challenges that are anticipated in the future are failing to do so
1106829 so how can ecowas in its joint mandate to deal with both humanitarian and peacekeeping begin to start facing these types of problems given climate change and a whole host of factors that might lead to a crisis that might disturb the peace
1106830 by working with them very closely we hope to find a process methodology techniques tools that will help the wider humanitarian community to be more anticipatory and more adaptive in the future
1106831 the hard sell is to get this community to think in terms of future vulnerability
1106832 we get constantly into this argument oh this is very academic im here to save people and my point is if youre really here to save people then start working and being more strategic about dealing with the future
1106833 things and the dynamics are changing and the traditional way that the humanitarian community thinks about these things prepares for them discusses them are increasingly irrelevant
1106834 people are being increasingly responsive somehow the message is getting through
1106835 what were trying to do now in washington is make sure that the funding that comes from the cap consolidated appeals process and trade system in the united states which could literally yield billions of dollars paid by those who are creating the climate change problem is allocated to help communities in the future adapt to climate change related causes
1106836 were trying to get funding put aside through the us budgetary system for helping communities in the future adapt to humanitarian crises of the consequences of climate change
1106837 we in fact do use scenario planning quite a bit in our work and have for several years now
1106838 the g8 did not rise to the challenge laid down by president zoellick and others
1106839 as far as i can tell theres no new money or substantive commitment zoellick was calling for action not words so there seems to be quite a mismatch between his call and what the g8 did
1106840 its not impressive its not much of an advance on the state of play they should have been more specific about where assistance should come from and how much it should be there should have been a bit more introspection among the g8 about the role of g8 country polices in contributing to the crisis namely agricultural policy biofuels policy
1106841 we need to follow through with practical measures that can make a real difference in addressing urgent hunger needs throughout the world
1106842 ensure the compatibility of policies for the sustainable production and use of biofuels with food security and accelerate development and commercialisation of sustainable second generation biofuels from non food plant materials and inedible biomass
1106843 the impact of biofuel policies in developed countries on this crisis was not acknowledged in addition the g8 made only a vague commitment to reverse the overall decline of aid and investment in the agricultural sector
1106844 unfortunately the 2008 hokkaido summit produced no significant breakthroughs and failed to meet the expectations of firmer and more comprehensive commitments to end extreme poverty and protect the environment
1106845 they did put this high on their agenda probably the highest its been since they started having the summits in the 1970s to talk about hunger and food insecurity
1106846 so i think thats positive and the endorsement of the un framework for addressing this was important to get the richest countries behind that
1106847 our us own trade policies are part of the problem
1106848 and perhaps your reward will be in heaven but not here on earth but id like to thank you
1106849 this is her 15 minutes of fame and shes enjoying it
1106850 my advice to her is if she likes mccain republicans and the bush agenda then she should go the republican convention

1106862 hey honey im not sure if we should keep this flower vase i was given for my junior year prom in 1995
1106863 hey baby i bought these little notepads from the 1 clearance rack at target about 8 years ago i think i might find something to do with them one day what box should i put them in
1106864 hand them to me ill find a special box for them in the trash bin
1106865 the g8 nations shoulder much of the responsibility for current global conditions and should commit to the achievable goal of ending hunger as a fundamental step towards alleviating human suffering increasing international security and fostering economic growth
1106866 i suspect that the g8 by themselves will not come up with that level but there might be some additional pledges of resources
1106867 one of the reasons that were facing food insecurity now and the food price crisis is because agricultural productivity has declined so dramatically
1106868 i hope they will adopt a more science based approach to decide whether or not countries should adopt gm products rather than basing it on scientific biases
1106869 hopefully a more evidence based approach could be used as a standard for admitting or not admitting gm production
1106870 the subsidies systems in western countries must encourage greater economic investment in sustainable forms of agriculture in the least developed countries
1106871 i have been stopped twice in the last three months while photographing in the public areas of union station
1106872 basically im just embarrassed that we dont have a standard policy
1106873 there are over 5 000 people who work at the station in the course of a business day and you may get many different answers on a given issue
1106874 highest level of free and open access to the public
1106875 the press release said the essence of what occurred it was not intended to give a minute detailed explanation of what took place
1106876 i wasnt going to give you a blow by blow account of what happened
1106877 a little tiff like holding up food has the potential to set things off at any moment
1106878 inmates were fighting other inmates for different reasons inmates were robbing other inmates and they broke into the counselors office
1106879 the benefit isnt as big as it looks when you sit down and eyeball it
1106880 we are working feverishly right now to resolve the issue
1106881 some of it i was going to spend on shopping the rest i was going to save for college
1106882 actually i was supposed to go today with my friends to the movies
1106883 as soon as i get up there im not nervous i love to sing and i want to be a gospel singer
1106884 that 90 seconds is really a killer for a lot of people
1106885 we want to make it a positive experience here it takes guts to get up on that stage
1106886 number one we have to have a heightened sense of urgency in terms of getting rid of the backlog
1106887 were going to detail folks like putting cops on the street
1106888 the mayor should do whatever they need and if they run a deficit im open to helping them meet that deficit
1106889 whats sad is that there was a period when the agency was definitely improving and getting a foothold on reform
1106890 creating a global disaster mechanism possibly under the auspices of the un could bring together and scale up in a more holistic manner the existing fragmented resources
1106891 theres certainly room for improvement but we shouldnt throw out the baby with the bath water and we dont believe that the solution is to start all over again with one unified facility
1106892 we dont believe it will solve the fragmentation that way if you were to put all of that under one roof its going to be a mess and you wont solve any problem you need a different mechanism for the quick things you need a different mechanism for the disaster risk reduction you need another mechanism for real project monitoring its not necessarily positive to believe that you put it all in one pack and you solve the problem
1106893 10 billion is a good start obviously its a good round figure but its not going to be enough but you dont need it all in a fund because actually what we are propagating is that development investment needs to reduce risk
1106894 we concur with the authors that more needs to be done particularly in disaster risk reduction and recovery which will require not only financial resources but political commitment at all levels local regional national and international
1106895 there is therefore a risk that such a mechanism could result in a sense of complacency a sense among member states that they have done their part even as either of these estimates may actually understate the amount of funding required
1106896 any mechanism that provides for an integrated and more effective means of funding disaster response has to be good news
1106897 my concern however is that there remains too much focus on disaster response as opposed to disaster preparedness my hope for the new mechanism therefore would be for it to embrace preparedness to a much higher degree in order to redress this balance countless studies and examples have demonstrated that time effort and money spent on preparedness leads to significant disaster risk reduction and therefore reduces the need for post disaster relief
1106898 money is hoarded and those with the most effective brands and marketing tend to get most of the funds and not fund other agencies out of their own surplus this continuing problem might just be ameliorated by a un entity with real legal standing
1106899 i want a chicken sandwich with white stuff and apples and water because i eat healthy
1106900 ive made myself available to those who havent bothered to ask im here ready to be found by those who havent bothered to look i kept saying im here im right here to a nation that ignored me i reached out day after day to a people who turned their backs on me people who make wrong turns who insist on doing things their own way they get on my nerves are rude to my face day after day make up their own kitchen religion a potluck religious stew they spend the night in tombs to get messages from the dead eat forbidden foods and drink a witchs brew of potions and charms they say keep your distance dont touch me im holier than thou these people gag me i cant stand their stench look at this their sins are all written out i have the list before me im not putting up with this any longer ill pay them the wages they have coming for their sins and for the sins of their parents lumped in a bonus
1106901 because theyve practiced their blasphemous worship mocking me at their hillside shrines ill let loose the consequences and pay them in full for their actions

1106939 tarence is a talented young perimeter player that has good length and athleticism
1106940 if a player scratches on a legal break shot 1 all balls pocketed remain pocketed exception the 8 ball see rule 4 8 2 it is a foul 3 the table is open
1106941 defined to execute a legal break the breaker with the cue ball behind the head string must either 1 pocket a ball or 2 drive at least four numbered balls to the rail
1106942 when the breaker fails to make a legal break it is a foul and the incoming player has the option of 1 accepting the table in position and shooting or 2 having the balls re racked and having the option of shooting the opening break or allowing the offending player to re break
1106943 an object ball is considered to be illegally pocketed when 1 that object ball is pocketed on the same shot a foul is committed or 2 the called ball did not go in the designated pocket or 3 a safety is called prior to the shot illegally pocketed balls remain pocketed and are scored in favor of the shooter controlling that specific group of balls solids or stripes
1106944 opposing player gets cue ball in hand this means that the player can place the cue ball anywhere on the table does not have to be behind the headstring except on opening break this rule prevents a player from making intentional fouls which would put an opponent at a disadvantage with cue ball in hand the player may use a hand or any part of a cue including the tip to position the cue ball when placing the cue ball in position any forward stroke motion contacting the cue ball will be a foul if not a legal shot
1106945 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services

1106949 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1106950 regardless of whether you go to the super bowl or not youve got to learn from your mistakes

1106992 from what ive learned about chalazions its an oil gland that is clogged because its under developed mostly occuring in children because of that its not bacterial why an antibiotic

1107026 in questa vicenda dei lavoratori precari spiega il capogruppo della lega nord in commissione finanze a montecitorio la lega ha voluto portare allattenzione un aspetto non basta lavorare qualche settimana o qualche mese in unimpresa magari pubblica per poter poi ottenere un posto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato il lavoro fisso lo si ottiene in via generale non per sentenza ma grazie alla professionalit e capacit dimostrata
1107027 unazienda ben felice di assumere un lavoratore se questo ha dimostrato di saperselo meritare il caso delle poste era emblematico di un sistema tutto tipicamente italiano in cui bastava lavorare qualche settimana per ottenere poi il posto fisso se questo fosse il sistema applicato in tutte le aziende ha concluso il deputato del carroccio queste fallirebbero tutte

1107123 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities

1107198 were going to expand on the reign of starscream story that were doing and tie everything in to what this next movie is going to be
1107199 the next movie starts out with just tons of action and theres obviously going to be a lot of questions so were hoping to answer some of those beforehand
1107200 i have a lot of respect for the guys from the various horror series because im also a fan
1107201 i think venom could headline a good movie on his own but it would be tricky and would depend in large part on the script
1107202 so is he feeling older faster as a result of the campaign trail
1107203 barack obama has been campaigning for president for 18 months it was just four years ago that the relatively unknown illinois senator burst onto the political stage at the 2004 democratic national convention now the 47 year old has been campaigning around the clock and around the world
1107204 im getting gray hair running for president will age you quick
1107205 yeah his hair is a little bit but you know thats normal for his age group you know not too much gray just a little bit
1107206 i think probably a little more gray a little more wrinkles probably isnt such a bad thing for somebody whos running for president
1107207 some say it obamas youth can be a double edged sword
1107208 the fact that hes one of the younger people to ever have been nominated for president helps to underscore the change issue the down side is whether or not obamas age combined with his relative lack of experience will suggest to some voters hes not ready for the job
1107209 after all obamas certainly not the youngest man to run for president bill clinton was 46 when he was elected john f kennedy was 43 robert kennedy was even younger
1107210 was 42 nobody raised the age issue because his experience in the kennedy administration as the second most powerful person having gone through the cuban missile crisis absolutely took experience off the table
1107211 senator obama is being a campaign junky he recently gave up smoking which ages you he has a reputation for eating healthy but it is a very different story on the trail or at least in these photo ops where hes eating hot dogs tacos fajitas cheese steaks and cake
1107212 perhaps the former high school hoopster burns off the calories while courting voters at campaign events
1107213 and while its common to see presidents raising their heart rate its also common to see them aging while in office if obama gets to the white house only time will tell what his face will look like in four or even eight years
1107214 china is a nation with a long history of forgiving and also tolerance
1107215 i f someone brings out a banner that says free tibet what do you anticipate the response of chinese officials to be to something like that
1107216 well that i dont know but to me i think that kind of protest is natural because these guys are actually using every opportunity to disrupt and such an event like this will be an opportunity that they wont miss
1107217 nine out of ten people says sic that the leadership the nations leadership played a key role in actually resolving these in addressing that crisis and the people also follow them around

1107228 coach mackinnon has great knowledge and experience of the game his strong suit is his background of developing players having coached at college basketballs highest level and most recently worked as a scout in the nba for the la lakers makes him a great choice for the 14ers bob is a very good coach and even a better person who is respected throughout the world of basketball
1107229 bob mackinnon is a first class gentleman of high integrity he is highly respected by everyone that i know who has had the pleasure of working with him i have seen him in action both on and off the court as a coach and a leader and there is no question that he knows what he is doing bob possesses a great love for the game of basketball and he will prove to be a great asset to both the colorado 14ers and the national basketball association development league

1107234 the black community is at least as traditional in its views as the larger american public
1107235 generally subprime lending and the foreclosure crisis is presented as if it is only an issue for minority and low income borrowers
1107236 however the data shows that the problem is much broader than just with minorities and low income households my belief is if we widen our lenses to see that this problem affects all segments of society we will change the tone and context of our approach to solutions
1107237 yeah there are a lot of younger bands that are leaning back towards rock and roll but you know the best thing all the bands know how to play their own instruments

1107460 but its turned out that all those scary stories which you know maybe some of them were true and maybe some of them are history i dont know havent appeared to us we havent seen the boogeyman
1107461 and you know humans arent perfect issues come up publishing is hard and were doing it internationally so things come up from time to time
1107462 the clich that im pushing is its not the cards youre dealt its how you play them so when things come up the ea guys are very honest about it theyre accountable about it and theyre responsive you cant ask for anything more than that

1107484 earlier artists were aware of struggle but the fresh breed wants quick success art consultants would only focus on business aspects and would not hesitate to promote even junk
1107485 similarly now art management and consulting firms are trying to get a foothold by being intermediaries between artists and galleries and other operations that involve a lot of money artists have to understand that while curation is an aesthetically designed activity consultation is just a business
1107486 yes in spite of so many talented artists and big galleries here till date there has hardly been any representation of our local works in the international art fairs abroad art curators can only curate shows while art management firms manage the whole affair ranging from logistics to money artist neednt bother about management issues they can just focus on their work
1107487 consultants network with galleries abroad and facilitate the presence of art connoisseurs and collectors so that the artist gets the best deal we help artists to hold exhibitions mostly in uk and dubai where there is a huge demand for indian art
1107488 as some of the trophy criteria noted in our last post seemed familiar some drew the conclusion that the ps3 wouldnt have unique trophies that is not the case

1107507 in tunisia we have a twenty five percent unemployment rate if you hold elections in such circumstances the result will be a fundamentalist government and violence like in algeria first create an economy then worry about elections
1107508 history has demonstrated that there is no final triumph of reason whether it goes by the name of christianity the enlightenment or now democracy to think that democracy as we know it will triumph or is even here to stay is itself a form of determinism driven by our own ethnocentricity

1107510 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
1107511 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

1107533 a string of illegal raids on st petersburg enterprises and properties between 2004 and 2006 committed by an organized gang formed by vladimir barsukov kumarin
1107534 but only half of the amount has so far reached the state coffers as most of the violators are too poor to afford the fines
1107535 about 80 000 rubles in fines for employing an illegal manual laborer is quite a big burden for most employers but the penalty is worth it as it makes an employer think twice before taking the risk
1107536 the most important goal is to draw attention to the tibet issue to show sympathizers in the city that we exist and to show the world that such action is possible in russia

1107553 the dangers of exporting democracy bushs crusade is based on a dangerous illusion and will fail
1107554 i think the fact dawkins in all his programs and interviews seem to emphasize to people and tell them that it is so obvious with the ludicrousness of religion and interviews people who believe in ghosts and so on and try to reason with them as to show the nonsensicalness
1107555 another problem is the way dawkins is calling people towards atheism the fact that science is a logical way to approach things and it is but calling people towards atheism in such a manner can turn atheism into something more organized and having something more organized can lead to a complacency in thinking and fall into all the traps religion have fallen into but nnot as much worse the way dawkins has categorized atheism and what it is and the role of it he has made it seem as so if someone was to question science they would be shot down i think the scientific method should be open to criticism and people like dawkins should advocate rather than make it the absolute position in ones thinking
1107556 the most obvious level is the modern disappearance of god as collective murder a little behind comes the collective murder of the pagan gods as the generative power behind their existence and way behind the most difficult level of all is the passion of jesus that cannot be the death of the christian god if the murders of the gods are always their birth but that could well be the death of all other gods in the banal sense we have in mind when we talk pf
1107557 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
1107558 1 the theory that physical matter is the only reality and that everything including thought feeling mind and will can be explained in terms of matter and physical phenomena
1107559 by the standard of empirical causality in science thats the best scientific explanation and has the most real meaning
1107560 the thesis that religious experiences are merely a hijacked response to concrete situations which stimulate natural cognitive processes is empirically testable and has real meaning whether or not its completely true is certainly debatable
1107561 as most of those who founded modern science and philosophy were christians
1107562 would have to conclude that there was some sort of designer personally guiding the process
1107563 whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve
1107564 a process of imaginative conjectures and empirical refutations advancing the truthlikeness of theories about reality but necessarily in a state of finite knowledge and infinite ignorance
1107565 in order to recognize an explanation as the best one neednt be able to explain the explanation in fact so requiring would lead to an infinite regress of explanations so that nothing could ever be explained and science would be destroyed so in the case at hand in order to recognize that intelligent design is the best explanation of the appearance of design in the universe one neednt be able to explain the designer

1107583 washington d c the federal communications commission fcc today approved with conditions the transfer of control of licenses held by rural cellular corporation rcc and its subsidiaries to cellco partnership d b a verizon wireless verizon wireless overall the licenses and authorizations transferred in the merger include cellular licenses broadband personal communications service pcs licenses local multipoint distribution service licenses local television transmission service licenses common carrier fixed point to point microwave licenses and two international authorizations action by the commission and effective upon adoption august 1 2008 by memorandum opinion and order and declaratory ruling fcc 08 181 chairman martin commissioners mcdowell and tate commissioner adelstein approving in part concurring in part and issuing a statement commissioner copps approving in part dissenting in part and issuing a statement
1107584 i approve this merger generally because in this the item the commission recognizes the potential for harm in six markets including in rural areas of vermont and requires divestitures of licenses and operational network assets in those markets this is critical since our market by market analysis unveiled high market shares for the merged entity in these mostly smaller markets and few competing service providers with sufficient network assets or spectrum to deflect anticompetitive behavior by the newly merged entity i also share many of the concerns of senator bernie sanders regarding increased consolidation in the wireless industry and the need for continued buildout to benefit the citizens of vermont and in rural america generally the lack of reliable wireless service in many of our rural areas stunts economic growth and the capabilities of first responders it is incumbent upon this commission to examine ways to accelerate buildout in rural america
1107585 todays item permits verizon wireless to acquire rural cellular corporation rcc subject to the divestiture of customers facilities and spectrum in several markets across the country while i am always troubled by additional concentration in the wireless marketplace these divestitures will improve competition in the affected areas as compared to an unconditioned merger and i am glad we require them i think it is particularly important that verizon will divest all of rccs spectrum facilities and customers in vermont to the nations largest gsm carrier it will ensure that native vermonters and visitors to the state who happen to have gsm phones will continue to be able use their handsets i applaud the hard work of senator sandersand other members of the vermont delegation as well as of vermonts state agencies in focusing the commissions attention on this issue i also hope that the ongoing discussions between the vermont telecommunications authority and verizon about expanding coverage in the state will continue in good faith and will ultimately prove fruitful the public private partnership that vta has proposed could prove to be a critically important model for how to expand wireless coverage in rural areas i for one will be watching its progress closely

1107591 it leaves me with no other choice of course you dont easily make such decisions i had a really good european championship with oranje and i look back with a good feeling
1107592 i had a long talk with ruud and the only thing i can and want to do is respect his decision of course its a shame that i cant use his qualities and international experience i hope that ruud will do great at real madrid

1107871 parents and guardians can go online to a web site and pull up their childs information and they can prepay
1107872 they can put as much as they want into their childs account
1107873 parents will have the ability to print out a copy of their childs history report this history report will show you all dates and times that your child has purchased a breakfast and or lunch within the past 30 days
1107874 caverna school district will not profit from the use of this site to offset the cost of this convenience fee the districts food service department will provide one free meal for your son or daughter for every 25 you put on their account
1107875 for example a purchase of 25 will be charged a convenience fee of 1 75 but in return you will receive one free meal valued at 1 50
1107876 we thought it would be convenient for our parents to be able to go online and make payments from home and be able to manage their students accounts from home
1107877 parents can look on there at anytime to see if their children are getting low and they can put money in there

1107882 at this point given that we have plenty of money in the bank it makes a lot more sense not to distract ourselves with trying to put the finishing touches on a revenue plan
1107883 unless we have a reliable service that works the way we think it should
1107884 for over the last 200 years youve seen big companies grow off the concept of real time updates
1107885 if you look at media companies like thomson reuters or bloomberg or the stock exchange people and businesses are dependent on real time news coming in as it happens twitter is similar except its much broader than just one kind of news like stock updates so when you think of it that broadly as a utility i think you can begin to imagine how big the potential is for twitter as a commercial entity
1107886 how would they respond to us putting ads on the site
1107887 there is a level of intent that someone is showing when they come to a twitter search and type in say iphone
1107888 these folks are influencers and they want to talk about the hottest or latest stuff going on
1107889 if youve got 1 000 people following you somethings happening
1107890 the real potential is in the future when youve got 10 000 people following
1107891 the beatport perry farrell customer appreciation afterparty was shut down by the city of chicago
1107892 the city claimed the party had become too well known by the public changing the status from an invite only private industry event to a public event
1107893 our representing council worked extremely hard to get this ban on the event reversed but as it was the weekend we were not able to connect with the appropriate members of the city
1107894 beatport perry deadmau5 and all of the hard working staff are just as let down as you are
1107895 some pictures attached show the level of production we had waiting to go for what would have been a mind blowing event
1107896 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
1107897 its just such an upsetting situation and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
1107898 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
1107899 house of heroes has earned the title of artist by combining swift key and tempo changes with thoroughly narrative yet genuinely poetic lyrics demonstrating that hit songs need not be the result of some worn out formula for radio success this track provides listeners with a much appreciated display of true musical originality and inventiveness
1107900 thats been eliminated now youre on to the rehab process he said

1107903 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1107904 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1107905 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1107906 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1107907 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1107908 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1107909 if we had no sexual harassment we would have no children

1107917 when you wear formal shoes be sure to wear socks in good condition socks should be a dark color never match black leather shoes with white socks
1107918 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
1107919 those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances those who give it away those who traffic in it
1107920 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
1107921 you can definitely do it part time and in fact i think thats the best way to start

1107942 its a huge relief i almost feel like we won
1107943 we had a good race car at the end that is more important than our fuel mileage or our strategy was we had a car that could run with all the guys that beat our butt last week and beat our butt most of the first half of this race we made a lot of adjustments on it
1107944 i felt like we had a strong top five to top 10 race car all day long at indy and whatever happened in the end happened and its behind us

1107952 se ha ido a par s a cuidar a su hermano que est enfermo
1107953 crude futures are down despite a brewing storm and that shows you how momentum has shifted in this market
1107954 despite all these bullish inferences a lower market must mean that participants have an infinitely greater concern about a deteriorating global economy
1107955 their being examined and tested every three months and if they are unfit to practice they lose their license
1107956 y dec an que bonito era vernos pasear queri ndonos infinito pensaban siempre ser igual
1107957 well were wearing these satellite dish sized visors and sun block with an spf of 720 even though its midnight because two percent of the damaging uv rays can still cause skin damage
1107958 in my day we beat our children with nail spiked canes and they thanked us for it but you go right ahead ask your child to use your angry words and see how far you get
1107959 we didnt have condos we had cardboard shacks toilet paper we used poison ivy we ate mold for breakfast and squirrels boiled in used bathwater for dinner it built character but you wouldnt know anything about that with your fancy subzero fridge and viking stove

1107961 whats his license plate number i have half a mind to call the police and report him
1107962 there are many participants numerous interactions much trial and error learning banks of the columbia river
1107963 i found every single successful person ive ever spoken to had a turning point the turning point was when they made a clear specific and unequivocal decision that they were not going to live like this anymore they were going to achieve success some people make that decision at 15 and some people make it at 50 and most people never make it all
1107964 we had like eight dudes in the same house and we were all just doing drugs and fuckin the same bitches on the same days sometimes at the same time just getting rowdy
1107965 we had a guy living in the laundry room jamie lived in the garage everybody played in a band
1107966 you kinda just did whatever you had to do to make it
1107967 it was all for one and one for all at that point yknow
1107968 several states havent understood that true democracy is only possible if citizens have free access to public information
1107969 the important thing is to know that censorship exists not only when measures are dictated that prohibit a medium from publishing something
1107970 closing the strait of hormuz for an unlimited period of time would be very easy
1107971 the guards have recently tested a naval weapon which i can say with certainty that the enemys ships would not be safe within the range of 300 kilometers
1107972 without any doubt we will send them to the depths of the sea
1107973 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights
1107974 im so damn tired of people out there thinking im doing bad things
1107975 were not bad people were just trying to give these animals some kind of quality life
1107976 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
1107977 senator obama doesnt appear to have the ability to hold the traditional democratic coalition together as well as mrs clinton might
1107978 ill vote for whoever can bring the price of gas down
1107979 one thing i keep seeing is a lack of wherewithal to tackle the tough issues like health care illegal immigration
1107980 its sort of like overhauling the tax code if there was an easy way to tackle it without conflict they would have done it already at some point it takes some backbone to get it done get some backbone and decide what you stand for
1107981 hes resting quietly and has some fractures nothing life threatening nothing permanent
1107982 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1107983 they had to use the jaws of life to extract him from the vehicle
1107984 he was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1107985 my aim in life when i graduated from high school was to get out of mississippi
1107986 i started coming back in about 1979 because my parents moved back which i couldnt understand what in the world would make you come back here it took me about 20 years to figure that out
1107987 i met him like a month and a half ago when we were doing a walk through in the house and its funny he mentioned that he was bringing his daughter here to live so i guess he thought he was not going to get caught
1107988 it is not a secret that the west is creating a buffer zone around russia involving in the process countries in central europe the caucasus the baltic states and ukraine

1108001 massachusetts residents who heat their homes with natural gas or oil could end up paying nearly 1 billion more this year than they did in 2007 about a 30 percent increase according to a university of massachusetts report set to be released today its a tremendous amount of money out of peoples pockets said robin sherman the reports lead author people can cut back on heating to some extent if it gets too expensive but theres obviously a floor beyond which they cant go to keep themselves in their homes without freezing the increase will have an especially dramatic impact on the nearly 1 million households that are heated with oil which now sells for about 4 70 a gallon up from 2 59 a year ago according to the massachusetts department of energy resources
1108002 the literary dissident alexander solzhenitsyn once wrote that ordinary individuals have a responsibility to not participate in lies but it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie
1108003 a four year old israeli girl was left behind at the airport yesterday as her mother father and four siblings rushed to catch a flight to paris
1108004 youve probably seen it by now the images of britney spears and paris hilton dissolving into footage of barack obamas speech in berlin as a voice dripping with sarcasm proclaims hes the biggest celebrity in the world
1108005 westboro baptist church of topeka kansas known for its vocal condemnations of homosexuality website
1108006 so the battle over michigan and florida ends not with a bang but with a conciliatory note from barack obama one of the last formal bones of contention if it can be dignified with such a description between the obama camp and that of his chief rival for the democratic presidential nomination hillary clinton is being disposed of and the way for a fully harmonious convention where clinton is not only not nominated but personally encourages wavering supporters to get on board the obama bandwagon is being cleared
1108007 mobile internet devices will allow people to browse the web better than they can on todays smartphones
1108008 some of these devices will have support for full cellular voice and in some cases will replace handsets this market will begin later this year and grow to about 90 million devices in 2012
1108009 the access linux platform is well suited for the flexibility and customizability required to deliver new product concepts in the emerging mid category
1108010 by working with access to integrate omap platform based hardware and software we can provide an integrated solution for our customers to help speed time to market and deliver no compromise web browsing and an enhanced user experience
1108011 orange and access share a common vision for a truly open mobile community which delivers richer mobile services more affordable devices and a better user experience
1108012 we continue to work together in the context of limo to create a standard linux based mobile platform that will benefit the entire industry access is a key partner within the orange signature accelerator program which provides a great user experience through the delivery of embedded orange customized applications
1108013 the key is to know how and what resources to utilize to gather the best information
1108014 new users should know that there is a great community of linux users that are willingly dedicated to helping people with technical problems for absolutely nothing and those resources are available in a few different ways forums irc chat rooms mailing lists local linux user groups and a plethora of web sites dedicated to providing the community with linux how tos
1108015 if i had to write a linux starters kit it would be along these lines
1108016 windows users switching to linux need to understand packages and repositories
1108017 repositories whether yum are the killer app for linux they provide the greatest single advantage over windows from an end user perspective
1108018 but in reality installing linux software especially if its in your repositories is one of the easiest things you can do
1108019 i recently read comments about someone who gave up on linux because they couldnt install family tree maker when a perfectly good alternative gramps was only an apt get away
1108020 customization new linux users should be encouraged to customize their desktop
1108021 not only will this show off the power of xfce compared to windows but it will get the user accustomed to the idea that they can and should make changes to their computer to make it look and feel and act the way they want it to every time i see a default ubuntu desktop i see a failure to teach someone about linux
1108022 windows users are afraid of the command line and rightfully so its a scary place in windows if they think that they need the command line in linux then linux will scare them
1108023 i think they should be exposed to the terminal told what the command line equivalent is of any gui action a gui focused how to or help guide tells them to do and again encourage them to play around in it
1108024 making software free is what makes it work for them so it is important that they understand it
1108025 once the users understand the philosophy of open source they can understand the open source community and why support forums are often better than an 800 number
1108026 i think by far the easiest way to learn linux is to get together with others who know how to use linux
1108027 after the user is started its much easier to use help pages to get the rest of the way
1108028 seriously if one is technical and wants to learn linux i recommend buying one of many linux magazines they almost always have some distro cd with them in the stores then find an old machine around the house and install linux
1108029 i tend to favor the oreilly books consider starting with linux in a nutshell
1108030 start in the etc directory look at files ending in conf cfg rc look in the directory etc rc d init look at the startup scripts look in sbin and do man xxx on commands found there those are sysadmin commands youll learn about how to manage the system also look in usr sbin for some less pedantic admin commands
1108031 start ls ing in bin usr bin and usr local bin do man xxx on anything that piques your curiosity
1108032 if by now your curiosity isnt piqued stop youre not interested in linux
1108033 if this got you started i apologize in advance for taking up the next few years of your life
1108034 the first thing you need when learning linux is a solution
1108035 for me windows was bloated and the switch to linux served a purpose
1108036 id say the best way for a new user to get familiar with linux is to play with or install if a hard drives free one of the many excellent live cds available
1108037 you no longer need to understand your system to pick which distro would work the best since just about every distro works the same todays installers will not only set up a working system but actually migrate your settings from your former operating system so that you dont really even need to configure it
1108038 back in the day obtaining ice cream was a bit harder
1108039 you made a decision on what flavor you wanted gathered the ingredients for that flavor made the ice cream and picked how you wanted to serve it
1108040 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires

1108042 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1108043 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1108044 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1108045 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1108046 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1108047 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1108048 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1108049 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
1108050 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1108051 its possible somebody could hide that from all of your co workers and nobody would ever hear about it
1108052 a lot of it is just consternation at the ridiculous motives theyre attributing and i get upset whenever i hear that
1108053 i got information mostly second and third hand from the people who were still working with him
1108054 and the changes really began to accelerate in the past year
1108055 one of my friends who worked with him said he would sit at his desk and weep he really couldnt do his work anymore the pressure was tremendous
1108056 the patent is owned by the united states government there may be some small monetary incentives but the government owns that patent
1108057 it became a running joke how he never returned them to me
1108058 one week after i saw the fbi ivins brought them back to the house but neither one of us could talk about that that was the big elephant in the room that we couldnt discuss because i had signed a paper saying that if i discussed anything about this interview i could be liable for criminal prosecution
1108059 i dont know what to make of the restraining order
1108060 i dont have direct information on that i knew him for 15 years he was in the division for a lot longer than that and that kind of thing never came up
1108061 brings a whole host of different ingredients to the table
1108062 we are hard pressed to imagine a better candidate than dr jha
1108063 we believe he is very well respected both in industry and in the investor community
1108064 from motorolas perspective we expect this will improve the companys competitive positioning
1108065 were beginning to look at a final number with at least a 5 in front of it
1108066 theyre seeing it multiple times on imax on the regular screens
1108067 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys tme and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1108068 there was a lot of shouting and pushing people fell down and could not get up they just suffocated
1108069 the police did not allow people to step back meanwhile people started coming down from above shouting go back go back
1108070 since the police did not allow the people to go back this tragedy happened
1108071 exclusive brad and angelina share their beautiful family with us
1108072 they are the two biggest stars as a couple in the world last time they did this it was proven to be successful since then we have become even more celebrity obsessed unfortunately
1108073 ok has had one or two big issues in recent times including the rooney wedding so they had to compete what they are hoping is that they put on circulation and then they keep some of it
1108074 hello really do need to be seen to be bringing in the really big ones from time to time
1108075 its really just something we put together because for a lot of people our age its hard to do the things we really want to do without lots of experience for example im the director but i have no experience ive wanted to try it and blackbox gives me that opportunity
1108076 its the same thing with the musical director milne and the lighting designer etter these are all things weve wanted to try but the only way to get the opportunity was to do this do it ourselves
1108077 they make you want to have that ability to direct
1108078 of course theyre not going to hire you if you havent done lighting design for example they need to find the best and make it the best show possible so what were hoping to do is offer the youth in the seacoast the opportunity to gain the experience and be given the opportunity with experience they might be able to do something for a theater like seacoast rep or the players ring
1108079 when i need something i ask when im facing problems with how to get something across to the cast or a staging issue ill ask rob scullin im not asking to the point of having them stage for me but i ask to understand the process better
1108080 we didnt know how to get them up to specs for mgi the company that owned the rights
1108081 we didnt know theres things like the authors name has to be on it in a certain spot its something very specific stacy told us it wasnt legal then we went back to the contract to see what needed to be done
1108082 wed rather not make mistakes but its not awful that we do because were working in an environment that allows for it and expects that mistakes will be made it really is a learning process for us
1108083 i think the mistakes really help us the struggles are necessary its the only way were going to understand
1108084 to be honest we had a passion for the show and its a good thing we had that passion because if we didnt i dont think we would have pulled it off
1108085 what were trying to do is just not constrain ourselves if we can put up a percussion ensemble with 10 kids and put on a great show well do it
1108086 its going to be a really fluid organization once youve hit 21 youre out someone is going to replace you in another year the founders will all be gone and theyll be all new people

1108090 and the award for best cable coiling by an electrician goes to
1108091 its time to move on time to embrace another aspect of bearness
1108092 we apologize for the knee jerk reaction and have issued a retraction order the affected stores are being directed to put the magazines back on sale
1108093 the parody of our newspaper ad in the august mad was very clever most of us at circuit city share a rich sense of humor and irony but there are occasional temporary lapses
1108094 guaranteed in stock if youre friends with an employee who hid it in the back for you otherwise ooh sorry all sold out
1108095 any of our other 600 stores directly across the street from 600 other best buys
1108096 which incidentally was featured in last weeks flyer for four hundred bucks more pity the suckers who bought it then
1108097 as a gesture of our apology and deep respect for the folks at mad magazine we are creating a cross departmental task force to study the importance of humor in the corporate workplace and expect the resulting powerpoint presentation to top out at least 300 pages chock full of charts graphs and company action plans
1108098 we at mad were shocked and confused by this entire incident mainly because we had no idea that circuit city even sells magazines nonetheless we accept their apology but hold out hope that their gesture of a 20 gift card is only an opening offer
1108099 in order to play 2010 world cup qualifiers in stadiums at the level of such a competition fifa took the initiative to inspect several stadiums in africa in the past months
1108100 based on the inspections and thanks to the works already realised since then fifa has authorised that these stadiums be used for the preliminary competition matches of the 2010 world cup
1108101 however in most cases fifa has decided that the present authorisation is conditioned by the mandatory completion of some works by the end of november

1108108 the person who actually presses the button to make the recording supplies the necessary element of volition not the person who manufactures maintains or if distinct from the operator owns the machine
1108109 cablevision more closely resembles a store proprietor who charges customers to use a photocopier on his premises and it seems incorrect to say without more that such a proprietor makes any copies when his machines are actually operated by his customers
1108110 there is place for both open source and proprietary in any sme environment its really about the right tools for the job
1108111 for example in a desktop environment in which users just need a simple web interface basic word processing and a spreadsheet an open source package such as ubuntu running openoffice would be perfect these users dont need the bells and whistles of a microsoft office
1108112 absolutely the way to go open source allows for rapid change customisation and greater flexibility
1108113 sme versions of heavyweight proprietary solutions generally offer fewer features than their big brother counterparts which is why they are more affordable for the sme but what if the particular whistle that has been left out is one the sme needs and what if there are still features in the lite version that the sme can easily do without
1108114 with an open source option smes can have a solution that not only fits their precise needs it will be easy to scale as the business grows

1108120 combining the tools of genomics virology and evolutionary biology he and his colleagues took a virus that had been extinct for hundreds of thousands of years figured out how the broken parts were originally aligned and then pieced them together after resurrecting the virus the team placed it in human cells and found that their creation did indeed insert itself into the dna of those cells they also mixed the virus with cells taken from hamsters and cats it quickly infected them all offering the first evidence that the broken parts could once again be made infectious the experiment could provide vital clues about how viruses like h i v work inevitably though it also conjures images of frankensteins monster and jurassic park
1108121 this is something not to fear but to celebrate heidmann told specter one day as they sat in his office at the institute which is dedicated to the treatment and eradication of cancer
1108122 these viruses made those changes possible it is quite possible that without them human beings would still be laying eggs
1108123 it is actually these discrimination tests that give rise to qserp in the first place
1108124 at the end when the game is over when the computer is cooling off you know whether you passed the irs nondiscrimination tests or not
1108125 at some point in the future the irs may well take the position
1108126 they include the amendment with other amendments and dont make it obvious

1108137 when i was young i believed in all sorts of antiscientific silliness like the bermuda triangle astral projection and the like but then i saw mr randi on television masterfully and literally dissecting psychic surgery con artists who fake using psychic powers to do phony surgery on desperately ill victims and he opened my eyes and my brain to the idea that reality is a better place to live in than fantasy i owe it all to mr randi so i am very excited and deeply honored to continue his vision with the jref
1108138 i want to teach kids about the wonders of the real universe we can do this by partnering with the educational community and developing fun hands on materials that schoolchildren can use in the classroom to teach them about critical thinking and the scientific method science is sometimes taught as being cold and dull but nothing could be more wrong its exciting its fun and its cool kids are natural scientists and we need to encourage that foster it and let it grow

1108146 most of the words that came out of my mouth had nothing to do with how i felt but at the same time i realized that my native tongue didnt have words for how i felt either its just that this never occurred to me until id begun to live in a foreign language often it sickened me to hear people speak their native tongues fluently it was as if they were unable to think and feel anything but what their language so readily served up to them

1108150 is going to depend in large part on how the fec decides to implement it
1108151 i think theres going to be a lot of discussion over who falls under these regulations who is considered a lobbyist or lobbyist registrant
1108152 there is also going to be a lot of discussion about what is bundling
1108153 titles based on levels of fundraising access to events reserved exclusively for those who generate a certain level of contributions or similar benefits
1108154 the data that we disseminate as a result will be a little different a little less certain
1108155 i think that is somewhat inescapable because of the nature of politics
1108156 there is going to be a certain level of due diligence that the campaigns are going to have to do the question is at what level
1108157 i think there are some interesting questions that one still could ask and there are some interesting questions that are asked
1108158 theres no doubt that since bcra there has really been a premium on this sort of fundraising
1108159 bundlers are significant figures and i think it is appropriate for there to be disclosure
1108160 we have more in common with public libraries than not

1108165 but the traveling press registration e mail has us flying to south bend at 6 30 p m tuesday and not leaving until 3 25 p m the next day it seems seems like an awfully long time to be in one place
1108166 in the future wouldnt it be great if you had a shoeboxed card for example and you could swipe it at a store and they could just e mail it to you at your shoeboxed account
1108167 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened

1108175 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1108176 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1108177 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1108178 we have suspected for a long time that these virulence proteins had some way of slipping inside plant cells to suppress immunity our findings finally nail down that mechanism and enable us to focus on how to block the entry mechanism
1108179 the finding that virulence proteins from oomycetes and the malaria parasite plasmodium use the same entry mechanism means that we may be able to use the same or similar drugs to block infection by both groups of pathogens this type of approach may also be relevant to other groups of pathogens such as fungi which we also suspect of slipping virulence proteins into host cells
1108180 the double barreled gene gun enabled us to make much more accurate measurements of the avr1b protein than were previously possible which made it practicable to measure the action of the rxlr and deer motifs

1108184 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1108185 we need to offshore drill for oil and natural gas
1108186 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1108187 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1108188 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1108189 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1108190 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month

1108204 we have found bobby to be well behaved and he has shown no aggression towards staff or towards any other dogs we believe that this is due to the loving home and the responsible owner therefore we would recommend that he is placed on the dog register

1108208 i want our new dog jake and other dogs to be healthy and not suffer from cancer
1108209 we are truly grateful for morris animal foundation and the work they do pets are members of families and no one should have to say good bye to a family member due to cancer research for humans and animals alike is important to help all live a long healthy life

1108218 he knows that there are great forces in heaven and earth that mans philosophy cannot plumb or fathom
1108219 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
1108220 thus if there is an abiding nature of man such as that found in the christian tradition then all men will expect a much more finite and confined goal to politics which will restore it to tasks that are accomplishable in this world
1108221 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

1108231 it is nearing the time for me to step down and choose the next ceo i have decided to choose one of you i am going to give each one of you a seed today one very special seed and with no rhyme or reason for who gets what seed i want you to simply plant the seed water and care for it and then come back here one year from today with what you have grown from the seed i have given you i will then judge the plants that you bring and the one that i choose will be the next ceo
1108232 one year ago today i gave everyone in this room a random seed i told you to take the seed plant it water it and bring it back to me today with whatever it had produced but i gave you all boiled seeds they were dead it was not possible for them to grow all of you except jim have brought me all sorts of plants obviously when you discovered that the seed would not grow you substituted another seed for the one i gave you jim was the only one with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it therefore he is the new ceo

1108239 i want to advise those in tskhinvali to stop playing war games and to find a better use of their time and review the peace proposals
1108240 the threat of large scale military actions between georgia and south ossetia is becoming more real
1108241 the recent actions of sukhumi and tskhinvali come together in one logical chain
1108242 georgia is sending troops to south ossetias border under such circumstances we cannot talk either with the group of friends or the georgian side
1108243 we have seen a pattern in which the rise of tension coincides with a suspension of dialogue or efforts to renew the talks
1108244 now when efforts have been stepped up to internationalize the format of engagement fighting breaks out again
1108245 this may seem highly unlikely given georgias current leadership and foreign policy goals but if there is not enough willpower in tbilisi and tangible support from the west georgia may eventually succumb to the pressure
1108246 the georgian government must do its utmost to avoid military confrontation and push for creation of an international mechanism for monitoring the situation in the conflict areas

1108291 today the most insane wasteful spending program in america comes to an end
1108292 we will comply with any changes in federal law and we will be able to implement these changes easily
1108293 when anything brings discredit on the student aid programs that disgrace needs to be avoided
1108294 fernando is a wonderful driver who would be a fantastic asset to any of the top teams including this one
1108295 the job ross and i have is to build a world championship winning team
1108296 of all the drivers right now he is the only one that i see as totally complete as michael schumacher was
1108297 firstly when the contract with fernando was terminated there were pre conditions which determined the behaviour of both parties post termination
1108298 we have no intention of breaching that agreement his opinion is his opinion im not going to voice my opinion about anything that fernando has done or said
1108299 what i would say is you cant see any strings leading to heikkis shoulders and hes an honest guy he will more than convince anyone who talks to him that this is a team absolutely committed to equality it always has been and it always will be
1108300 people will point to the last grand prix at hockenheim and say its absolutely obvious there were team orders in that event because it was clear that heikki moved over and let lewis past the essential fact was that throughout that race lewis was nearly seven tenths of a second faster than heikki and he knew that he was told that he was not told to let lewis past
1108301 we have not found the actual cause but there is a high possibility of a puncture
1108302 we could not see any debris on the tread surface although we could not analyse the shoulder area because he ran half of a lap with a depressed front tyre and the sidewalls were badly damaged so the possibility is of a side cut and then after that it depressed suddenly
1108303 when there is a flat spot it means there is a very thin shoulder area close to the ground so maybe a sharp stone touched the sidewall meaning there was a possibility to cause a puncture
1108304 what happened now was totally unexpected we havent seen it before
1108305 we were just slow really slow sometimes in phases of the race robert was the slowest car on the track so it was like we werent there
1108306 you cant define just one single problem because everything is related to everything else
1108307 the problem of segregation begins at birth and ends only with death romani women deliver their babies in a segregated maternity ward romani children attend segregated schools they live in a segregated neighborhood the bulgarian government simply has no need for well educated intelligent roma
1108308 out of twenty thousand who live in nadezhda less than one tenth are literate we have no more than twenty people with a high school diploma thats one in a thousand out of twenty thousand residents we only have four with a college degree we live in the stone age here in nadezhda what is there to change
1108309 nobody in bulgaria would bother to read such a thick magazine
1108310 you have to put your heart into it nothing else matters
1108311 gypsies are vagabonds who profess to tell fortunes by examining hands their talent is to sing dance and steal
1108312 the mentality of the bulgarian people lacks the ideological enlightenment which our people enjoy having spent their entire lives with armenians greeks and gypsies the bulgarians see no harm in the jew to justify special measures against him
1108313 the policies of the bulgarian administration toward the roma have been absolutely outrageous
1108314 somebody writes documents votes on legislation but there hasnt been any change nothing everything is one big theater performance a complete sham of course the communists made the mess in the first place but things have only been getting worse since
1108315 what goes down to the people is just a trickle more funds should be spent on monitoring so that we can make certain that those in need can be given real help
1108316 the bulgarian engineer of the nadezhda quarter and the country
1108317 god ordained their fate they need to go to bed hungry once or twice to learn the value of work and stop begging give them ten loaves a never be enough if they dont earn what they eat they have to start helping themselves
1108318 we didnt have rights back then but we had work now we have rights but you cant feed your family on freedom
1108319 the family over there are adventists but i am a baptist
1108320 adventists dont allow pork but baptists are fine with it and i love pork
1108321 if were not part of the city plan does it mean we are dogs
1108322 you are from the university right dont say no i can tell by your looks you come here asking questions so that you can write your dissertation after that right you ask for percentages numbers you take pictures you just want to watch and then go home you want to make money out of us you want to rob us
1108323 that you should come here to watch us dance so that others can laugh at us this is sinful you know
1108324 i just wanted to become a cop not a very high position you know and they didnt accept me why because i am a gypsy
1108325 roma need to be ten times better than the average bulgarian its a lot of pressure if you know what i mean
1108326 la tengo como un joystick con la marca de los dedos y la puntita roja
1108327 existe la necesidad de que bolivia y estados unidos reconduzcan sus relaciones bilaterales para descongelar la cuenta del milenio
1108328 los mecanismos de cooperaci n se abrieron tremendamente en el pa s
1108329 bolivia no es el pa s del 2000 y 2001 ya que existe otra realidad econ mica y si nos preocupa es algo relativo
1108330 as como estados unidos se molesta de algunos temas pues bolivia tambi n
1108331 no es posible a que otro pa s se le de mucho dinero para terminar con la coca excedente y en vez de disminuir los cultivos crecieron en 27 por ciento de coca en los ltimos a os

1108337 data protection is the number one concern of chief information security officers but todays dlp solutions take too long to deploy and obtain results
1108338 with the pending acquisition of reconnex mcafee expects to redefine the entire data protection market by bringing together a leader in the hottest segment with our comprehensive portfolio of data protection technologies we expect that this will enable us to leapfrog other data protection vendors and to reinforce our position as the largest dedicated security company
1108339 se pas de un promedio de 20 y 30 toneladas al a o al actual de casi 300 nadie dice que eso ocurre por pol tica oficial
1108340 el informe dice que hay un aumento en el n mero de hect reas de cultivo de coca pero tambi n revela una reducci n en la producci n
1108341 no en estos nueve a os de su desarrollo hemos visto un progreso que es positivo hay que estudiar el informe de la onu hay que sacar lecciones
1108342 no han logrado cambiarse los incentivos que existen en las zonas productoras
1108343 un esfuerzo desde hace un a o y parece que ese a o se hubiera perdido la onu dice una cosa estados unidos dice otra vamos a contratar una firma privada para que nos digan la verdad

1108348 preocupaci n de la onu ante el aumento del 27 en la superficie cultivada de coca respecto del a o anterior
1108349 en educaci n hay poca asistencia del gobierno mientras que en transporte y salud no hay nada
1108350 nosotros como alcaldes pagamos a los maestros y es un problema porque tenemos otras necesidades que cubrir pero es el estado nacional el que debe pagar a los profesores
1108351 tenemos infraestructuras educativas antipedag gicas falta de mobiliario y apoyo presupuestario para las escuelas nuestros docentes no tienen acceso a cursos de capacitaci n y carecemos de instituciones de ense anza superior para nuestros hijos
1108352 no hay ambulancias ni material quir rgico y mucho menos especialistas los hospitales han perdido categor a por falta de equipos m dicos los que fueron hospitales ahora son centros de salud existen altas tasas de mortalidad de madres y ni os y una alta incidencia de enfermedades como el paludismo y la fiebre amarilla tomamos agua del r o de all las infecciones
1108353 por eso la gente se dedica a la actividad il cita no hay otra salida ante el total abandono en que nos encontramos
1108354 el estado tiene una estrategia militar pero no para el desarrollo agrario y sin embargo es un punto clave sin estrategia agraria nada funciona
1108355 los precios de los productos alternativos son muy bajos y ning n programa del estado nos presenta opciones atractivas que puedan suplantar nuestros cultivos de hoja de coca el cacao caf y achiote una planta que se emplea como colorante no tienen precio fijo
1108356 el a o pasado los productores del vrae obtuvimos el primer lugar a nivel nacional por la calidad del caf y el cacao pero a n as no hay recompensa para el sacrificio de los campesinos por el contrario nos castigan con el abandono absoluto por ejemplo no tenemos carretera para trasladar los productos que cosechamos el transporte es un sue o postergado por muchos a os
1108357 en localidades del huallaga como tocache y uchiza donde virtualmente no se pod a ingresar se trabaj coordinadamente con las autoridades locales y se compartieron responsabilidades
1108358 no s lo se trata de concentrar a militares polic as y fiscales en las zonas de cultivo de hoja de coca sino tambi n de aplicar programas de desarrollo con una coalici n de autoridades locales y estatales y por supuesto con la cooperaci n internacional
1108359 se debe a la presi n que ejercen los consumidores especialmente los de europa
1108360 la coca que circula en quito es comprada en sucumb os y carchi
1108361 conocemos sostiene que hay un aumento sensible del consumo en quito por eso estamos fortaleciendo las pol ticas para el control de la demanda

1108364 la violencia no es un fen meno coyuntural en la historia de colombia es una constante a que se debe creo que en ltima instancia a la resistencia y a la fuerza con la que la gente busca conservar y reconstruir sus relaciones sociales primarias frente a reg menes pol ticos abusadores la violencia acompa a siempre al expansionismo se llame mercantilismo liberalismo econ mico o globalizaci n fue establecida en rigor a la cat strofe democr tica que signific la colonizaci n espa ola en am rica en parte fue producto de una guerra de exterminio tendente a la dominaci n y de ah el t rmino de conquista con la que se define la poca y en parte un cometido religioso de naturaleza cultural las dos armas la espada y la cruz sirvieron para desplazar a la poblaci n nativa arrebatarles sus tierras y riquezas para subordinarla explotarla y en el mejor de los casos volverla tributaria de la corona espa ola

1108439 israel decided to take the humanitarian decision to transfer to jericho 87 residents of the shujaiya neighbourhood in gaza because of the violence carried out by hamas
1108440 we talked with them on the bus and we told them that jericho and the west bank are different from the gaza strip and that the israeli army controls this region they have to respect the law
1108441 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger

1108532 hier in china terug uit het westen worstel ik met de aanzienlijk negatieve berichtgeving over de spelen in het westen worstel omdat ik het westen maar ook hoop ik na 10 jaar het oosten begrijp nee ik jok ik snap het oosten niet maar wat ik zeker weet is dat veel westerse journalisten en mensen als erik van muiswinkel het nog minder snappen ik was een maand in nederland en ik heb met verve naar ik hoop china verdedigd en eigenlijk zou dat niet zo moeten zijn ik weet net als ieder ander dat er veel niet deugt in de wereld en inderdaad in china klopt er ook het een en ander niet je kan spreken van een onderdrukking aan de andere kant zijn de maatstaven van het westen niet geheel toepasbaar in het oosten hier kan een grootmoeder om 12 uur s nachts alleen haar ommetje maken zonder beroofd te worden ik kijk in het vrije nederland om die tijd altijd over mijn schouder en ik ben geen grootmoeder we zingen terecht de lof van de democratie en hoe groot dat goed is maar we zouden eens moeten begrijpen dat er systemen zijn die horen bij een land en een cultuur aan onze democratie mankeert ook het een en ander als g w bush de chinese president hu een lesje komt leren over mensenrechten vergeet hij gemakshalve guantanamo bay waar gevangenen zonder recht op enig proces worden vastgehouden iets wat in china gebeurt en algemeen wordt afgekeurd
1108533 wat een heldere uitspraak er zijn systemen die horen bij een land en een
1108534 wat een ontzettend ranzige laster van rob uit china dat je in nederland niet na twaalf uur s nachts over straat kunt baarlijke onzin in grote afrikaanse steden is dat misschien het geval maar voor nederland geldt dat absoluut niet
1108535 a die hanneke dank voor je vriendelijke mail en dank voor de plaatsing van een stuk op je weblog de reactie vandaag van barry van zandvoort was waarschijnlijk 1 uit velen en waarschijnlijk de meest vriendelijke hehehehe te verwachten natuurlijk de kleine verwijzing naar de bosnische griezel is flauw het illustreert wel mijn punt alles wat slecht is in 1 vakje dat maakt het oordelen erg eenvoudig barry heeft echter gelijk en ik heb het ook het ligt in china niet simpel we zien vaak over het hoofd dat china in veel opzichten een ontwikkelingsland is dat stap voor stap westerse waarden omarmt oude ideen uit het mao tijdperk slijten slechts langzaam de controlepraktijken van het public safety bureau en de lijst is eindeloos van cameras in de hotelkamers van atleten tot het eindeloos moeten registeren van bezoekers in china komen voort uit angst de controle te verliezen hoewel ik goed inzie dat die praktijken absoluut fout zijn begrijp ik die angst wel zou china morgen als eenheid ophouden te bestaan en uiteenvallen zoals de oude ussr dat deed zijn de gevolgen voor niemand te overzien er zitten veel mensen vast in china voor politieke activiteiten wij vinden dit terecht onacceptabel in ons nederlands denkraam past dit niet en als actief lid van de homobeweging in beijing snap ik heel goed hoe moeilijk het is om je nek uitv te steken voor iets waarin je gelooft in een maatschappij die veranderingen ziet als een moeizaam probleem en ik praat hier niet over mezelf maar over de vele chinezen die hun geaardheid moeilijk kunnen uiten dat ik mij veilig voel in dit land komt niet door een dictatoraal regime maar door een diep gewortelde sociale controle die weer voortkomt uit het idee dat het belang van het individu is gediend met het belang van de groep het kapitalisme doorkruist dit enigzins kleine sociale units als de oude woonwijken worden geruimd voor winkelcentra en dure flats ik heb in 10 jaar veranderingen gezien die niemand voor mogelijk heeft gehouden ik ben onbespied surf vrijelijk over het net ontmoet elke chinees die ik wil ontmoeten en voel dat ik vrij kan praten de positieve veranderingen vinden mijns inziens niet plaats door de druk van groepen uit het westen maar door behoedzaam manoevreren hulpacties zoals bv ten tijde van de aardbeving invloedrijke diplomaten die gerespecteerd worden door de chinezen en veel contact we moeten van elkaar gaan zien dat we geen bad guys zijn de olympische spelen hadden het ontmoetingspunt moeten zijn ze worden overschaduwd door de acties van het public security bureau en de negatieve berichtgeving in het westen er had zoveel goeds uit voort kunnen komen er waren volgens mij twee tegenstrijdige bwegingen gaande tijdens de aanloop naar de spelen een warme uitgestoken hand van china ingegeven door de olympische gedachte en de afwijzende strenge hand van het psb dat het voor bezoekende buitenlanders zo moeilijk mogelijk wilde maken deze schizofrene houding van de chineze regering kan ik ook niet begrijpen maar hun angst wordt wellicht gevoed door de stevige protesten in het westen ik ben niet zo naief als barry misschien denkt de os hadden china niet helemaal opengegooid naar het westen de doodstraf zou niet zijn afgeschaft en politieke gevangen zouden nog steeds gevangen zitten ik zou alleen willen dat temidden van al dat negatieve ook eens wordt gezien welke afstand dit land heeft afgelegd in de afgelopen jaren en dat het vooralsnog onmogelijk is om de chineze reus op korte termijn te veranderen ondanks de tegenzin die we misschien voelen de zachte hand is de beste als china haar gezicht kan behouden en inziet welke voordelen er zijn in het invoeren van veranderingen is er een positieve ontwikkeling maar verlangen dat china wordt zoals nederland dat is een utopie en gelukkig maar het werd een veel langere email dan ik had gepland mijn excuses als barry een discussie wil voel vrij om mijn email adres door te geven ik nodig hem graag uit om eens te komen kijken ik heb een ruime logeerkamer is rebbelientje alweer terug liefs rob ps hoewel ik het heel stoer vond om te lezen dat ik ooit in afganistan was nee het was het veel veiliger kazakhstan maar ja ik heb ooit jouw boektitel door elkaar gehusseld dus nu staan we quitte hehehehe

1108553 the overall decline in contract signings suggests we are not out of the woods by any means the housing stimulus bill that is still being considered in the senate is critical to assure a healthy recovery in the housing market jobs and the economy
1108554 some markets have seen a doubling in home sales from a year ago while others are seeing contract signings cut in half price conditions vary tremendously even within a locality depending upon a neighborhoods exposure to subprime loans
1108555 although inflationary expectations appear to be under control for the time being sharper consumer price gains could lead to notably higher mortgage interest rates in 2009
1108556 the speed at which home prices has declined in a few select markets is unprecedented but the large price declines in those areas have enticed bargain hunters back into the market
1108557 interestingly there have been reports of multiple bidding after the large price cuts so it is possible that most of the price declines have already occurred in those markets
1108558 in light of high inventory conditions rising commodity prices and construction costs will curtail new home construction deep into 2009
1108559 bargain hunters have entered the market en masse especially in areas that have experienced double digit price declines but its unclear if they are investors or owner occupants
1108560 sharp price reductions are leading to a quicker discovery of price equilibrium points the west is already seeing year over year gains in pending contracts
1108561 it appears that more buyers are realizing they can take advantage of a favorable combination of mortgage interest rates home prices and family income
1108562 overall affordability conditions are the best weve seen since the middle of the housing boom in 2004 but with far more choices and much less pressure than buyers experienced four years ago to make an investment in their future recent declines in mortgage rates on conforming jumbo loans and a return to sound but not overly stringent underwriting standards will permit more people to qualify for a loan
1108563 although mortgage interest rates will remain historically favorable they will start to steadily inch up
1108564 home sales are at about the same level as they were 10 years ago yet the population has grown by 25 million people and we have over 10 million more jobs
1108565 the housing market has been underperforming by historical standards partly because buyers were hampered by mortgage availability issues but thats improved and an upturn is more likely on the other hand its unclear what role consumer confidence will play in the coming months
1108566 sales gains will be greatest in areas that underwent sharp price declines
1108567 policymakers need to be attentive to the fact that many homeowners have seen a reduction in housing equity or are in an underwater situation more needs to be done on the policy front to alleviate hardships and bring fence sitters back into the marketplace
1108568 were seeing healthy price gains in moderately priced areas like erie pa and corpus christi texas and double digit gains in others
1108569 our most recent data shows sales rising strongly from a year ago in some areas that experienced sharp price drops including detroit and las vegas
1108570 rising construction costs will provide less room for price cuts on new homes
1108571 although mortgage interest rates will remain historically favorable they will start to steadily inch up

1108579 because my grandmother is home alone during the day while i work i come home over my lunch hour as often as i can to check on her grandmother has been with me for four years but still thinks she is visiting in the beginning she was quite independent and resisted any kind of help saying she could do everything on her own one day i discovered that she had gone into the back yard locked the door behind her and spent the afternoon sitting in the sun the temperature reached 100 degrees that day and grandmother had not eaten or drank anything all day this made me realize that for her safety and wellbeing she shouldnt be alone anymore

1108608 cricket was part of the 1900 olympics when great britain beat france but with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
1108609 over the next century the challenge for all of us who love the game is to spread the word of cricket to parts of the globe that have never heard of it and currently dont play our sport
1108610 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
1108611 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
1108612 is it a realistic dream i really believe it is the icc has already taken the step to become a recognised olympic sport and that is the first step on the road to becoming part of the olympic program
1108613 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 per cent of the worlds population
1108614 in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members

1108618 based on all the factors we are confident with the air quality during the olympic games mr sun said
1108619 well just try to keep him busy and keep him focused on what he needs to learn here and that he enjoys his time here i think is a big part of it
1108620 if everything goes well he will have his medical on tuesday and could make his debut in a friendly match on friday
1108621 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1108622 since speaker pelosi has decided not to keep the house in session to allow this vote to take place we urge you to use the power vested in you by the constitution to convene an immediate energy special session of congress
1108623 we know congressional democrats wont pass all of the appropriations bills theyve already demonstrated their failure with that but when they return theyll have a month to at least address the top priorities funding our troops by passing the dod department of defense appropriations bill and the bringing to the floor of the interior appropriations bill to allow for votes on oil shale and exploration of the outer continental shelf

1108633 ik zie weinig in dit idee de prestaties zullen het zelfde blijven zowel voor nederland als voor belgi gaat het voetbal achteruit veel spelers en coaches vertrekken naar het buitenland en wij krijgen er niks voor terug dat is een feit en de samenvoeging gaat die transfers niet voorkomen
1108634 als dit idee goed wordt uitgevoerd dan heeft dit plan een kans van slagen ik denk namelijk dat er nu meer topteams in n competitie zitten en geen teams die het niveau nauwelijks of niet aankunnen als er genoeg teams zijn met goed voetbal dan komen de prestaties in de europese toernooien vanzelf wel

1108690 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project

1108725 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those thirty years he was in washington for twenty six of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1108726 so when senator mccain talks about the failure of politicians in washington to do anything about our energy crisis its important to remember that hes been a part of that failure
1108727 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1108728 while the compromise is a good first step and a good faith effort i believe that we must go even further
1108729 like george bush and dick cheney before him he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like bush and cheney hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long
1108730 the oil companies have placed a bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1108731 when barack obama voted for the 2005 bush cheney energy policy he voted to give enormous tax breaks to the same big oil companies he attacked today
1108732 barack obama offered no new solutions for increasing domestic production of energy in his speech today but promised energy independence within a decade if barack obama thinks that can be achieved without new offshore drilling and more nuclear power he isnt being straight with the american people and if barack obama really believes that some progress has finally been made in washington then he doesnt have the judgment to know that the american people expect more

1108784 for 66 years students flocked to her studios at the cleveland institute of music and nearby oberlin and baldwin wallace conservatories and in the summers to her legendary harp camp in camden maine to acquire the new techniques of playing of which she was a leading proponent
1108785 though eyebrows were raised at the presence of a woman in the ensemble she retained her position unchallenged under the batons of four successors artur rodzinski eric leinsdorf george szell and lorin maazel until she finally retired in 1974
1108786 she was a superb musician and teacher and was particularly known for her disciplined technique
1108787 her students were so well prepared technically that they regularly won positions in major orchestras
1108788 she was referred to as a giant of the harp and she had immense fortitude
1108789 she could move a harp herself into her 80s in and out of a station wagon
1108790 as i contemplate the artistry of alice chalifoux and couple that with her indomitable feisty good humored spirit i can only feel eternally grateful for the privilege of having enjoyed her limitless and most colorful friendship

1108797 i would like to return to a time when civil liberties were not wisked away at the whim of politicians when the voice of individuals carried more weight than the influence of coprorate power and when american ingenuity was relied upon to solve our problems instead we have been told by government that citizens need to be spied on for our own security offshore oil rigs and coal burning power plants are preferable to windmills and solar panels and that we have no choice but to borrow billions of dollars from foreign investors i believe we do have other choices than those being presented to us by the status quo so i am asking the people of southwest missouri to vote outside the box when they go to the polls in november

1108821 its not going to swallow the whole planet its not going to even swallow ontario county thats just alarmist bullshit theres a far greater chance that martians will invade the earth we have pictures of the deep dark scary black hole on the surface of mars which is in all probability the muzzle of a hydrogen accelerator and we have the fact that the phoenix mars lander hasnt been able to come up with jack shit there is every indication that the martians disabled phoenix in order to hide their preparations i mean how else can you explain the fact that phoenix hasnt done shit up there its robotic digger arm isnt long enough it cant dig deep enough the soil wont fall out of the scoop the little e z bake ovens dont work there is water then there isnt water nobody knows who fucking said what clearly its martian sabotage theyre hiding their preparations to invade the earth again and if you ask me there are martian agents on earth right now sabotaging our ability to defend ourselves when the green flashes in the sky start falling on us

1108844 im really not for cutting their funding as the are great public facilities and organizations and should be supported but the people managing them are neglecting the trust we put in them when they begin to think they own something private for their own agenda and ignore the the rights of performers who add to the native entertainment of society
1108845 the case concerns the seattle center a public park although the majority

1108858 to the best of my knowledge we didnt do it
1108859 look its outside the rules of course assassinations take place but to hit a general in his own country is close to an act of war and we just dont want a war with syria we are busy talking to them
1108860 an iranian spy might be killed in lebanon a hizbollah guy in syria but not a syrian in syria with a sniper

1108882 the abject silence on the part of the canadian arab federation in the face of vitriolic attacks on jews by muslim perpetrators is tantamount to tacit approval of anti semitism and gives a green light to others who would entertain the notion of attacking jews
1108883 taj approached the group of teenagers around 10 45 pm and asked whos jewish
1108884 he then slapped her in the face and pullled her hair before her friends jessica motta kayla hungle and daniel ball attempted to intervene
1108885 the canadian arab federation has not only not uttered one word of condemnation for this horrific attack but they have remained silent in the face of arson attacks in canada directed against shuls and jewish community centers and violent attacks on jewish students on local university campuses
1108886 a jewish camp in northern ontario was attacked no one was hurt but property was smashed and tires slashed sending a clear message the camp staff was told by the town that jews were no longer welcome in their stores
1108887 jewish businesses in canada are picketed by groups supported by the caf claiming these businesses support israeli apartheid
1108888 making a strong case that it is every bit as radical and unhinged
1108889 recent sponsorship of an essay contest on the ethnic cleansing of palestine in which it urged high school students to channel the groups own fervid hatred of israel for prizes
1108890 under the guise of islamophobia the caf is promulgating hatred for jews in a fashion similar to that of the nazis during world war ii just as the nazis accused worldwide jewry of maintaining a secret cabal with the intent of dominating and oppressing the poor and downtrodden germans so too is the caf actively working to promote the fallacious and patently ridiculous claim that the jews run the world while muslims represent a powerless minority even though there are 1 4 billion muslims in the world and only 13 5 million jews
1108891 a fully paid up member of the anglo saxon mafia
1108892 muhammed is the messenger of allah and those who are with him are harsh towards the kuffar and compassionate towards each other
1108893 it is the ideology of the muslim brotherhood that justifies and promotes attacks on jews in canada
1108894 some kind of form must be signed that prohibits entry into canada of people that believe in the muslim brotherhood ideology this would make it possible to conduct denaturalization and deportation proceedings
1108895 our major concern is the safety of jews in our community and to that end we the jdl are offering security training to the community we will not just train anyone the jdl is not seeking a confrontation with adversarial forces but because of the level of violence and intimidation against the jewish community it is important to teach jews how to defend themselves should a situation arise

1108897 do you think i wish to look upon my decaying children or the atrocious display of my husbands body
1108898 they fell as the old crone said they would eris they thought they could be immortals amongst men and have fallen for their self worth
1108899 god nymph muse the fates stand alone unaffected by all this
1108900 strategically our options are to hold out in a war in the mortal realm until our immortality diminishes all together or to willingly fall i would love to express a more optimistic situation but hera we are dying
1108901 my life will not be taken for their pleasure we shall give them what they want for now although they shall be responsible for their own downfall i will wreak upon them the true power of the gods they shall fear my wrath as they have never done before the queen of the gods has spoken prepare for battle

1108903 you dare to turn against the very beings that created you learn from your mistakes mortals hera does not die for your gratification the fates have deemed this the end of our reign acceptable the senseless murder of my family is grossly unacceptable and humanity deserves punishment this new age shall bring you nothing but turmoil until such time as the gods reclaim the heavens suffer the perils of the natural world your prayers shall remain unanswered for the gods have been denounced may the children of your children know nothing but pain as mine have done at your hands

1108911 esto se da porque no hay un cambio significativo se ha hablado de la impaciencias de la gente de la falta de comunicaci n del gobierno sobre las obras realizadas pero en realidad lo cierto es que la gente que tiene una opini n de rechazo muy fuerte a la gesti n del gobierno son aquellas que est n ligadas directamente a los aspectos m s cercanos a la vida de la gente y all eso no ha cambiado
1108912 hay cosas que se mantienen constantes en relaci n a encuesta similar en diciembre del 2007 cada vez es m s claro que lima ya no es el promedio del per en t rminos de opini n lima es distinta al resto del per el interior opina distinto en lima sigue constituy ndose la mejor plaza de garc a dentro de rangos bajos de aprobaci n en la gesti n as mismo el centro y el sur y en cierto grado el oriente han desarrollado un nivel de rechazo hacia el gobierno donde se encuentran las zonas m s pobres del pa s
1108913 siendo los temas econ micos los m s sensibles el desempleo inflaci n y no lo son todos porque cuando se le pregunta a la gente en relaci n a sobre cu l es el principal tema que afecta al pa s aparece casi con el mismo porcentaje 18 falta de trabajo corrupci n de los funcionarios del gobierno entonces lo que quiero decir es que existen temas que est n ligados a aspectos de legitimidad muy fuertes en t rminos generales
1108914 nuestro sector as como otros se encuentra mal remunerado en la sociedad y el espacio laboral
1108915 garantizar el funcionamiento de los servicios p blicos esenciales y resguardar puntos cr ticos vitales
1108916 la resoluci n se basa en la ley 28222 que a nuestro entender es inconstitucional ya que el art culo 137 de la constituci n faculta a las fuerzas armadas a intervenir solo en estado de emergencia
1108917 resulta evidente la amenaza a los ciudadanos de que podr n sufrir agresiones de las fuerzas armadas adem s la resoluci n expresa una total ambig edad porque se ignora cu les ser n los puntos cr ticos ya que finalmente podr a tratarse de cualquier pista o avenida m s o menos importante
1108918 no est n preparadas para actuar durante conflictos sociales y su intervenci n puede causar violaciones a los derechos humanos tal como ocurri el 29 de mayo de 2004 cuando pretendiendo disolver una manifestaci n estudiantil en puno las fuerzas armadas mataron al universitario edy quilca y dejaron a varios j venes con lesiones permanentes cabe recordar que en los ltimos a os casi treinta manifestantes han muerto como consecuencia del accionar de la polic a nacional por un manifiesto uso desmedido de la fuerza
1108919 promoci n de la inversi n privada en reforestaci n y agroforester a
1108920 es responsabilidad fundamental de las autoridades garantizar el pleno respeto a los derechos humanos lo cual les obliga a ejercer sus atribuciones con prudencia y sensatez rechazando la tentaci n de abusar del poder y la fuerza
1108921 demonizaci n de los reclamos sindicales como si fueran ajenos a la vida democr tica de cualquier pa s y como si no fuera responsabilidad de las autoridades del estado abrir las v as institucionales para que los conflictos sociales sean procesados y solucionados oportunamente especialmente rechazamos el prop sito de criminalizar la acci n sindical aplicando medidas penales a conflictos que se deben resolver en el plano de la pol tica
1108922 pues no es funci n de ellas intervenir en conflictos sociales ni controlar el orden p blico ni est n preparadas para actuar convenientemente en tales casos esta funci n corresponde a la polic a nacional la cual debe actuar con procedimientos adecuados para tratar con manifestaciones de ciudadanos civiles
1108923 deben actuar con sensatez y respeto a la constituci n y la ley en consecuencia deben respetar los bienes p blicos y privados no incurrir en agresiones y respetar el libre tr nsito por las v as p blicas
1108924 la paz es un valor central de la vida social que todos tenemos la obligaci n de preservar pero la paz que se invoca como pretexto para anular el derecho a reclamar o disentir o para legitimar la represi n no es tal paz sino una contenci n artificial de conflictos que luego estallar n con m s fuerza

1108960 both governors appealed to those with the real power to make change average citizens to drive slower keep engines tuned and tires properly inflated to buy hybrids and lower overall consumption
1108961 you can improve your gas mileage by around 3 3 percent by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure under inflated tires can lower gas mileage by 0 4 percent for every 1 psi drop in pressure of all four tires properly inflated tires are safer and last longer fuel economy benefit up to 3 equivalent gasoline savings up to 0 09 gallon

1109019 your lies are not lies to you they are conditions you want to live out you have made greater efforts than any of us to live out illusions
1109020 i cannot believe that you will not come again towards me from the darkness of the garden i wait sometimes where we used to meet expecting to feel again the joy of seeing you walk towards me out of a crowd you so distinct and unique after you went away the house suffocated me i wanted to be alone with my image of you
1109021 and i did feel small in his bed naked but he felt the strength of the core of me which burns at his touch think of that when you hold my too fragile body in your arms a body you scarcely feel because you are so used to billowing flesh but you feel th movements of its joy like the undulations of a symphony not the static clay heaviness but the dancing of it in your arms you will not break me you are molding me like a sculptor
1109022 you have such a delicious sense of humor i adore that in you
1109023 this is strange before as soon as i came home from all kinds of places i would sit down and write in my journal now i want to write to you talk with you i love when you say all that happens is good i say all that happens is wonderful for me it is all symphonic and i am so aroused by living god henry in you alone i have found the same swelling enthusiasm the same quick rising of the blood the fullness before i almost used to think something was wrong everybody else seemed to have the brakes on and when i feel your excitement about life flaring next to mine it makes me dizzy

1109027 and then something i say arouses a sudden doubt in him
1109028 i fall asleep in his arms and we forget to finish the second fusion of ourselves he falls asleep with his fingers dipped in the honey to sleep this way i must have found the end of pain
1109029 we want to enjoy our new closeness for awhile live entirely in the present postpone the other issues we only ask each other for time to become reasonable again to accept ourselves and the new conditions
1109030 abdullah got the knowledge of hadith from us and he taught us how to pray

1109033 a man without witnesses married a woman and the witnesses were not present
1109034 i am doing nikaah with you whilst making allaah and his messenger sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam my witnesses
1109035 if anyone takes allaah and muhammad sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam as witnesses for nikaah then from the start that person will become a kaafir because he held the belief that the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam knows the knowledge of the unseen
1109036 that a man did nikaah without any witnesses and he said
1109037 that if someone understood that the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam had the knowledge of the unseen then he becomes a kaafir and if this aqeedah is held about someone else then how can the individual remain a muslim
1109038 the tableegh of the present nizaam ud deen delhi the headquarters of the tableeghi jamaat according to my knowledge and understanding it is neither according to the quraan nor to the method of hazrat mujaddid alf thanee hazreat shaah waleeullaah muhaddith dehlawee or according to the scholars of the truth so the scholars who participate in this tableegh their first responsibility should be to conform this effort according to the quraan hadeeth to the way of the scholars of the salaf predecessors and the scholars of the truth
1109039 to this day i had been assuming that he maulana ehtishaam al hasan remained in khandelah because of his bad health and and due to which he abandoned his presence in nizaam ud deen and did not participate in the work of tableegh however from this important note i found out the reason for him not participating was because acording to him the work of tableegh is not necessary rather it is destroying the religion
1109040 maulana ehtishaam ul hasan is from the founders of this movement and very recently he has strongly refuted jamaat ut tableegh and said it is a group that calls to misguidance
1109041 however even i am hearing that some of the represenatatives khulafaa and hawaas of maulana thanwee do not like jamaat ut tableegh
1109042 considering the innovation non sunnah to be the sunnah is a blameworthy act of the creedal aspect i fall short in understanding how is it correct to rectify some actions of the people and yet turn a blind eye to defects in their beliefs as the correct beliefs are the means of salvation and not the actions
1109043 this mistake is quite common that in general gatherings people are encouraged to deliver lectures who are not worthy to do so sometimes these very same people are not even fully aware of the associated issues and so whilst speaking they do not even realise the limits of their knowledge so this is the reality of this and these mistakes occur frequently so it is upon the superiors to think and reflect upon this
1109044 one of the disatisfactions the maulana ashraf alee thanwee had was how will these people ie jamaat ut tableegh call the people to the importance of tableegh without knowledge so when the nephew of the maulana dhafar ahmad thanwee informed him that the speakers who deliver these lectures only speak about the issues they have been ordered to speak about and they do not speak about anything other than this so he maulana ashraf alee became satisfied
1109045 defender of the sunnah al muhaddith al faqeeh the worshipper the pious and righteous al imaam al allaamah abu tayyib muhammad ataaullaah haneef bin mian sadr ud deen hussain al bhojiyaanee
1109046 i heard ash shaikh al imaam abu muhammad badee ud deen raashdee say thiqah trustworthy hujjah evidence imaam pious righteous and a faqeeh
1109047 my shaikh is thiqah from amongst the thiqaat trustworthy from amongst the trustworthy ones teacher there are few people like him in this era
1109048 he was from the major scholars of ahlul hadeeth of pakistaan
1109049 many scholars of the kingdom of saudia arabia have praised from the likes of shaikh hammaad al ansaari and shaikh doctor muhammad amaan al jamee
1109050 narrated to me abu al waleed khaalid bin fathee al filasteenee who said
1109051 a man allaah granted knowledge and action and good manners
1109052 those who were honoured by having ijaazah for books of hadeeth from the shaikh were
1109053 prepare food for the house of jafar because a thing has come to them that has preoccupied them
1109054 that i prefer or like for the relatives of the deceased that on the day of the death they prepare so much food for the household that it will last them the day and night so that they are satisfied because this is the sunnah and it is good and this is the action of the people of good before and after us because when the news of the death of jafar reached the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam he said prepare food for the house of jafar because that thing has come to them that has preoccupied them
1109055 we i e the companions would consider it a form of lamenting and mourning to gather at the deceaseds house to eat from there
1109056 that we would consider it a form of mourning to gather at the deceaseds house and to prepare food after the burial
1109057 preparing the food of the deceased and the gathering of the people then there is no mention of this but it is an innovation and disliked
1109058 some people have introduced this innovation that on the third day they prepare food at the deceaseds house and this is a norm amongst and within them
1109059 what is the hukm ruling on the food that is prepared in the deceaseds house for the fuqaraa the poor destitute on the third and the seventh day
1109060 all the things mentioned in the question all in all of them are prohibited innovations bida mamnooah
1109061 the food that is prepared for the people by the deceaseds family is makrooh because by this the family is further pushed into trouble and unnecessary pre occupation and also there is mushabbahah resembling the polytheists and the people of ignorance
1109062 preparing food in the house of the deceased is makrooh disliked because feasting is at times of happiness not sadness and this is a very bad and detestable innovation
1109063 in those days preparing food in the deceaseds house and eating the food is
1109064 preparing food in the deceaseds house up until three days is
1109065 for three days feasting is disliked makrooh and so is the food because feasting is at the times of happiness and preparing food on the first second
1109066 that gathering at the grave on the third day and distributing roses flowers and incense and feeding the people within specific days i e the third fifth ninth tenth twentieth fortieth sixth month and after a year then all in all these actions are prohibited innovations
1109067 this hadeeth is a proof for the command for eating from the deceaseds house and it is correct otherwise the messenger of allaah
1109068 eating from the deceaseds house is disliked makrooh and an innovation
1109069 divide this amongst the people so that the reward from this reaches my beloved ibraaheem
1109070 neither is this book awzajundee a writing of mullaa alee qaaree nor is this narration authentic or reliable rather it is mawdoo fabricated and baatil and it cannot be relied upon there is no trace of this narration in any of the books of hadeeth

1109206 once upon a time in the ages of romance and love there lived a man whose name was william blake he wrote a wise story for all mankind to read and to understand his story started when one day he was angry at his friend he told him of his anger and his anger ended then another day he was angry at his enemy he did not tell him so his anger grew he planted an apple tree in his garden and he watered it every night and every morning with hate and tears after many days of anger an apple grew on top of the tree the bad guy knew that the apple did not belong to him but he decided to steal it at night in the morning the bad guy was dead next to the tree with the apple in his hand and a bite in his mouth
1109207 he died because he stole it the bad guy took something that was not his
1109208 nothing he learnt that he should not poison a tree because it could kill people
1109209 this is sherif khalil director of human resources of el lokanda

1109217 what do you see as the webs biggest growth areas
1109218 mobile mobile mobile its probably the most wide open space out there right now
1109219 i love my office lisa and i am ready with the q amp a sheet we discussed this morning i also flipped through the crisis manual and i used some of your quotes i came up with some quotes on my own following the same direction
1109220 great miriam i just need to warn you of burn out we are like a candle use us with caution and wisdom we last longer keep us burning we burn out in no time how about you rasha all is well
1109221 so rasha what will you be working on i know you just got here but as you can see we are struggling to keep our heads above the water
1109222 i went through the figures and i do not see us making budget this quarter our best hope is to maximize business from the egyptian market during the 6 th of october long weekend el lokanda is not their first choice though so we need to work on an attractive yet affordable package to draw their business
1109223 i would love to promote it give it to me in a couple of days and i will have it on the website and in local media
1109224 i also want us to start working on a combined package for the gulf market for iftar bairam and christmas
1109225 this is just great rasha set those figures back on track
1109226 i came up with two lists the first is a list of all possible questions the media would ask and the second is a narrowed down list of the basic questions i recommend that only you and i respond to the detailed interviews and the rest of the staff will have a copy of our statement
1109227 the generic statement says el lokanda team would like to extend their most sincere condolences to the families of the victims this is a world tragedy that will change our lives forever o ur industry is going to be impacted severely at this point we are not able to speculate on how severely our hotel will be affected right now so soon after tuesdays tragedy it is not appropriate to talk about effects on business
1109228 i also want to propose an idea to show support for the international community why dont we offer peace dove cookies as a complementary turn down amenity it will cost us nothing but it is news material
1109229 well well well we have an idea generator on our team fly with it young lady
1109230 now i would like to take the two of you for a tour of the hotel i want you to be familiar with every inch in this facility are you ready
1109231 si algo me atrevo a sugerir a los guerrilleros de las farc es simplemente que declaren por cualquier v a a la cruz roja internacional la disposici n de poner en libertad a los secuestrados y prisioneros que a n est n en su poder sin condici n alguna
1109232 critiqu con energ a y franqueza los m todos objetivamente crueles del secuestro y la retenci n de prisioneros en las condiciones de la selva pero no estoy sugiriendo a nadie que deponga las armas si en los ltimos 50 a os los que lo hicieron no sobrevivieron a la paz
1109233 no pretendo que se me escuche cumplo el deber de expresar lo que pienso cualquier otra conducta servir a s lo para premiar la deslealtad y la traici n
1109234 fue el resultado de a os de intensa cooperaci n militar entre los ej rcitos de colombia y estados unidos
1109235 quienes desataron el terror en ese hermano pa s en sus pugnas por el mercado de estados unidos
1109236 pero no estamos a favor de la intervenci n militar extranjera ni con la pol tica de fuerza que estados unidos pretende imponer a toda costa y a cualquier precio a ese sufrido y laborioso pueblo
1109237 nunca apoyar la paz romana que el imperio pretende imponer en am rica latina

1109241 los hombres son usados unos junto a otros no por eso dejan de seguir estando en situaci n de virtual aislamiento en las grandes ciudades se re nen los hombres movidos por el deseo de ganarse la vida no se hallan en un estado de cooperaci n sino de aislamiento para hacer fortuna el cristianismo nos ense a a amar a nuestro pr jimo como a nosotros mismos la sociedad moderna no reconoce pr jimo ninguno bien vivimos en tiempos extra os puede que la sociedad se halle en su infancia dice egremont pero diga usted lo que quiera nuestra reina reina sobre la mayor naci n que haya existido jam s qu naci n pregunt el joven extranjero porque ella reina sobre dos naciones dos naciones entre las cuales no hay trato ni simpat a tan ignorante cada una de ellas de los h bitos de los pensamientos y de los sentimientos de la otra como si se tratara de moradores de zonas diferentes o de habitantes de planetas distintos de gentes nacidas de linajes distintos nutridas con alimentos distintos en posesi n de maneras distintas y no gobernadas por las mismas leyes usted dijo vacilante egremont est hablando de los ricos y de los pobres
1109242 la decisi n fue de 8 1 y solo hay un salvamento de voto la del magistrado jaime araujo renter a a adi carre o
1109243 no tuvo nada que ver no fue contactada para esta operaci n no se le ha pagado un solo centavo en ese sentido esa informaci n carece de toda veracidad
1109244 fiable y puesta a prueba en reiteradas ocasiones en los ltimos 20 a os
1109245 como comandante de las fuerzas militares niego que el gobierno de colombia haya cancelado un solo centavo por esa operaci n
1109246 fue logrado por las fuerzas armadas colombianas y su gobierno pero con una asistencia fuerte y necesaria de los estados unidos de am rica
1109247 conoc amos la operaci n y c mo se iba a llevar a cabo no puedo dar m s detalles por ahora pero el presidente george w bush la apoyaba
1109248 lo que viv no puede haber sido una escenificaci n
1109249 claro que compartimos la alegr a de que est n en libertad betancourt y otras 14 personas
1109250 todav a quedan centenares y miles sin libertad en colombia
1109251 el nico camino a seguir para que no quede nadie prisionero y que se logre la paz en colombia es a trav s del di logo y la negociaci n
1109252 sea el grupo de r o un instrumento que est all disponible con la buena voluntad de los gobiernos presidentes como el de venezuela el de ecuador como lo dijo la misma ingrid betancourt
1109253 entonces el grupo de r o es la oportunidad para empezar a trabajar seriamente por la paz en colombia y dejar a un lado la soluci n militar porque mientras se empe en en la soluci n militar dif cilmente habr paz en colombia
1109254 para que se d el paso adelante para establecer las bases para un proceso de paz en colombia
1109255 el paro del 9 de julio se justifica por el incumplimiento de las promesas electorales y la desatenci n a las demandas de las grandes mayor as
1109256 siguiendo el ejemplo del fujimorismo el gobierno aprista ha recortado los derechos laborales en beneficios de los grupos de poder econ mico

1109258 no podemos permitir nuevos cultivos de coca en las llamadas reas de reserva forestal
1109259 no se puede en la zona hacer lo que se ha estado haciendo en el huallaga que es la erradicaci n forzada desde nuestro punto de vista esto generar a un problema social muy grande
1109260 este a o por lo menos no pues no queremos una explosi n social
1109261 nosotros en las fuerzas armadas estamos convencidos de que no pienso que ser a un error
1109262 en lugares en donde hay plantaciones de grandes extensiones tal vez podr a ser pero pienso que ser a un error el 95 de la gente de la zona se dedica al cultivo de hoja de coca y si entramos a erradicar generar amos un problema social muy grande yo creo m s bien en establecer una subvenci n a los agricultores para que reemplacen las plantaciones de coca
1109263 las fuerzas armadas y la polic a nacional del per estamos terminando de elaborar un plan para actuar en los puntos m s cr ticos y disminuir as el ingreso de estos insumos este plan tiene que empezar lo m s pronto posible y por ello en los pr ximos d as me voy a reunir con el director general de la pnp
1109264 lo que viv no puede haber sido una escenificaci n
1109265 intercept la liberaci n programada para este fin de semana o el pr ximo
1109266 la liberaci n estaba programada para este fin de semana o el pr ximo seg n hab a acordado el secretariado y el propio alfonso cano por eso se daba el reagrupamiento las fuerzas armadas se enteraron e interceptaron la liberaci n para hacer creer que se trataba de un rescate
1109267 cada vez que se ha quedado en lago con los franceses y los suizos ha ocurrido algo por lo tanto aunque se sigue buscando el canje humanitario ya no habr m s conversaciones en el operativo de ingrid betancourt pusieron en riesgo la vida de los detenidos por lo tanto ahora las cosas deben cambiar
1109268 hicieron una campa a medi tica para mostrar al mundo que tanto la se ora betancourt como los otros detenidos estaban en p simas condiciones de salud ahora est demostrado que han tenido un trato mucho m s humano que el que reciben nuestros presos en las c rceles del estado ser a bueno que los medios de comunicaci n y la onu accedan a ver las condiciones en que est n la mayor a de nuestros presos
1109269 la extracci n de las farc les hace mantener humildes ahora ser muy f cil que hablen contra las farc incluso sus amigos pero la lucha de las farc no termina con un suceso como ste no termin tras diversas embestidas que han sufrido a lo largo de la historia no termin cuando mataron a m s de 5 000 compa eros de la uni n patri tica y no terminar ahora que el narco para gobierno de alvaro uribe y la oligarqu a colombiana no se embriaguen con este supuesto triunfo
1109270 el futuro de colombia no puede ser y no ser la guerra civil por eso es necesario que los pa ses de am rica latina jueguen un papel activo para llevar a un di logo que culmine en la paz
1109271 deja un ligero sabor a duda el papel de los pa ses amigos en esta operaci n militar con asalto a la confianza de una de las partes o de las dos no lo sabemos
1109272 ha servido de intermediaria desde que fue detenida por parte de las fuerzas
1109273 la liberaci n con las armas en la mano al mejor estilo ninja no ser a m s que una mascarada

1109293 the shameful attacks were carried out with planning accuracy high experience and complete secrecy to the extent that security agencies could not know the details at any state until the catastrophe struck such acts call for professional experts
1109294 this strengthened their position to the extent that they issued an eleven volume encyclopedia through which they call for and teach the art and science of terrorism
1109295 under the first shock after the september events there have been some mistakes in their statements but in fact all retreated and declared clearly that there is no war against islam we are against creating blocs against religions since the first moment i have stated sincerely and frankly that the world should give attention to what takes place in this area middle east and find a solution through a real plan for peace peace cannot be realized unless it is just and everyone gains his right
1109296 for if you forgive men for their transgressions your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men then your father will not forgive your transgressions
1109297 lord how often shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him up to seven times
1109298 i do not say to you up to seven times but up to seventy times seven
1109299 you wicked servant i forgave you all that debt because you entreated me should you not also have had mercy on your fellow servant even as i had mercy on you
1109300 forgive each other just as god in christ also has forgiven you

1109309 the lord also has taken away your sin you shall not die
1109310 however because by this deed you have given occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born to you shall surely die
1109311 pardon i pray the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness just as thou also hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now
1109312 o lord our god thou didst answer them thou wast a forgiving god to them and yet an avenger of their evil deeds
1109313 be on your guard if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him and if he sins against you seven times a day and returns to you seven times saying i repent forgive him

1109330 hi i got a new job im going to make you wait to hear about it while i tell you about fetching batteries
1109331 the story began in an unfavorable environment during the late 1970s many people thought that epidemic diseases caused by microbes including viruses no longer posed a threat in industrialized countries
1109332 an additional important contributor was the development of methods for growing t lymphocytes in culture for a period sufficient to allow the expression of putative latent retroviruses this effort was helped greatly by the isolation of specific factors in particular the t cell growth factor now called interleukin 2 in bethesda maryland the role of interferon in repressing the production of retroviruses in mouse cells was demonstrated in paris and this discovery led to the use of anti interferon serum in the search for human retroviruses thus at the beginning of the 1980s we had the essential tools required to search for a retrovirus in this new and menacing disease called aids but why search for a virus and specifically a retrovirus in aids the answer was far from obvious in 1982
1109333 at that time aids had already appeared as a long lasting disease with an extremely long lag time between exposure to the agent through blood or sexual activity and the profound state of immune suppression characterized by the occurrence of opportunistic infections or cancers many factors fungi chemicals and even an autoimmunity to leukocytes were invoked at that time as possible causes however for us there were clues first the various manifestations of aids were unified by a biologic marker a decrease in the levels of a specific subgroup of t cells that harbored the cd4 surface antigen cd4 and other cds had been identified only a few years earlier with the use of specific monoclonal antibodies thanks to the work of milstein and kohler the findings regarding the t cell subgroup suggested an agent that specifically targeted cd4 t cells and htlv the putative cancer causing virus was one such agent moreover there were animal models in which lymphotropic retroviruses caused not only leukemias or lymphomas but also an aids like wasting syndrome furthermore htlv was transmitted through blood and sexual activity as well as from mother to infant which was consistent with some of what we learned early on about the epidemiology of aids finally the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported cases of aids in patients with hemophilia who had received only filtered clotting factors which seemed to eliminate the possibility that the agent was a microorganism larger than a virus
1109334 this set of arguments convinced us as well as max essex in boston each independently to start a search for an htlv like virus in patients with aids we began conducting this research at the national institutes of health in bethesda and at the pasteur institute in paris the theory that a retrovirus caused aids was correct but the hypothesis that it was a close relative of htlv proved to be wrong in bethesda an earlier survey involving the use of molecular and immunologic probes seemed to favor a variant similar to htlv 1 the putative cancer virus in fact some patients with aids were doubly infected with htlv 1 and the new agent which complicated the interpretation of the nature of the virus causing aids
1109335 in early 1983 a clear cut isolate was obtained in paris with the help of interleukin 2 and anti interferon serum from cultured t lymphocytes derived from a lymph node biopsy specimen from a patient with lymphadenopathy a syndrome that was considered to be a precursor of aids this virus proved to be different from htlv in terms of antigenicity and morphology but it could be propagated only in fresh cultures of t lymphocytes and not in permanent t cell lines which impeded its full characterization the idea that the causative agent of aids should be sought in swollen lymph nodes was partly right since we now know that lymph nodes are the main site where the virus hides during the presymptomatic phase at this early stage it seemed more likely that the isolate was causative than that it was opportunistic since the immunosuppression was very mild in some ways however it was also a misleading idea that delayed the full characterization of the virus and its mass production for seroepidemiologic studies because only some viral isolates from patients with fully developed aids grow quickly in permanent cell lines as we would soon learn
1109336 this technical breakthrough was first achieved in late 1983 in bethesda among a few strains in the bethesda laboratory that grew in continuous cell lines one came unbeknownst to both of us from the third isolate from a patient with kaposis sarcoma in paris the origin of the hiv strain with a very high capacity for growth that could readily overcome other hiv strains in culture and which contaminated cell cultures in several laboratories beginning with both of ours was unraveled only in 1991 thanks to the use of the polymerase chain reaction technique
1109337 the patient will complain of rashes fever itching sore throat headache malaise vertigo sweating insomnia nausea prostration weight loss loss of hair or aching in the bones and joints some have hypertension kidney disease swollen liver or swollen spleen others have a subacute meningitis with cranial nerve involvement this stage of syphilis is often confused with such conditions as infectious mononucleosis iritis neuroretinitis lichen planus cancer nephritis dementia lymphomas psoriasis and other skin eruptions and even drug reaction for this reason secondary syphilis is called the great imitator
1109338 the treponema pallidum acts specifically against the thymus gland the thymus dependent parts of the lymphatic system deteriorate and there is consequent decrease in the numbers of t lymphocytes the t helper cells are particularly affected by this there is a decline in their number and the ratio with the t suppressor cells is reversed consequently a long term effect of syphilis is loss of or decline in the system of immunity and lowering of the individuals capacity to defend himself against other infectious conditions
1109339 hiv 1 was introduced at a press conference given by margaret heckler as being
1109340 we recognize that this case transcends the normal type of criminal case in that the conduct of these two scientists gallo and popovic reflects upon the integrity of the scientific process the national cancer institute and indeed the conduct of the government as a whole
1109341 the violence to principles of responsible ethical science was just as profound at a crucial point early in the gallo laboratorys hiv research international politics and the technocrats committed to those politics virtually took over that research claiming the laboratorys putative accomplishments as accomplishments of the united states administration and by extension the united states itself
1109342 once done the gallo laboratorys interests became the governments interests defending the gallo laboratory scientists reputations and claimed accomplishments became necessary for defending the honor of the united states the defense thus became a consuming effort for significant portions of the u s government
1109343 the result was a costly prolonged defense of the indefensible in which the gallo laboratorys

1109347 with an initial infectious titer of approximately 7 log10 tissue culture infectious
1109348 the centers for disease control and prevention cdc reported cases of aids in patients with hemophilia who had received only filtered clotting factors which seemed to eliminate the possibility that the agent was a microorganism larger than a virus
1109349 the t4 gene encodes the aids virus receptor and is expressed in the immune system and the brain the isolation of clones encoding the human surface protein t4 and the expression of the t4 gene in new cellular environments have enabled us to examine the role of this protein in the pathogenesis of aids our studies support a mechanism of aids virus infection that initially involves the specific interaction of the aids virus with t4 molecules on the cell surface this association can be demonstrated on t4 transformed t and b lymphocytes as well as epithelial cells furthermore the presence of t4 on the surface of all human cells examined is sufficient to render these cells susceptible to aids virus infection our data suggest that the t4 aids virus complex is then internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis finally we find that the t4 gene is expressed in the brain as well as in lymphoid cells providing an explanation for the dual neurotropic and lymphotropic character of the aids virus in this manner a t lymphocyte surface protein important in mediating effector cell target cell interactions has been exploited by a human retrovirus to specifically target the aids virus to populations of t4 cells
1109350 it seemed more likely that the isolate was causative than that it was opportunistic
1109351 rules for isolation of a retrovirus discussed at the pasteur institute paris in 1973 that were stated criteria of isolation in continuums missing virus reward
1109352 the existence of the retrovirus hiv predicts that hiv dna can be isolated from the chromosomal dna of infected cells this prediction has been confirmed as follows full length hiv 1 and hiv 2 dnas have been prepared from virus infected cells and cloned in bacterial plasmids 13 15 such clones are totally free of all viral and cellular proteins and cellular contaminants that co purify with virus these clones produce infectious virus that is neutralized by specific antisera from aids patients for example virus produced by infectious hiv 2 dna is neutralized by antiserum from hiv 2 but not from hiv 1 infected people
1109353 since infectious hiv dna has been isolated from infected human cells that is free of hivs own proteins and rna as well as from all cellular macromolecules hiv isolation has passed the most vigorous standards available today
1109354 the existence of hiv predicts that infected cells contain a unique virus specific dna of 9150 nucleotides that cannot be detected in dna of uninfected human cells the probabilities that cellular dna and other viral dnas would contain the same sequence of 9150 nucleotides is 1 in 4e9150 or 1 in 10e4500 extremely close to zero since the odds that a given nucleotide of any dna is either a g c or t are in 1 in 4 the odds that any dna has the same sequence of 9150 nucleotides as hiv 1 or hiv 2 are only 1 in 4e9150
1109355 thanks to the outrageous interest in hiv as the hypothetical cause of aids many investigators have sought specific hiv dna in humans with and without aids in an effort to confirm that rather unreliable hiv antibody test
1109356 but because only 1 in 100 t cells are ever infected in humans virtually all such studies use kary mullis polymerase chain reaction a technique that is designed to amplify a dna needle into a dna haystack such efforts have confirmed the existence of hiv specific dna in most not all antibody positive persons with and without aids but not in the dna of antibody negative people for example jackson et al have tested blood of 409 antibody positives including 144 aids patients and 265 healthy people in addition 131 antibody negatives were tested hiv specific dna subsets defined in size and sequence by hiv specific primers start signals for the selective amplification were found in 403 of the 409 antibody positives but in none of the 131 antibody negative people
1109357 the high sequence specificity of hiv dnas is translated into the specificity of their proteins eg antibodies against hiv 1 do not neutralize hiv 1 sic and vice versa
1109358 hiv has been isolated by the most rigorous method science has to offer
1109359 the uniqueness of hiv is confirmed by the detection of hiv specific dna sequences in the dna of most antibody positive people the same dna is not found in uninfected humans and the probability to find such a sequence in any dna sample is 1 in 4e9500 which is much less likely than to encounter the same water molecule twice by swimming in the pacific ocean every day of your life
1109360 such clones are totally free of all viral and cellular proteins and cellular contaminants that co purify with virus
1109361 avian lymphomotosis virus was originally isolated from leukemic chickens 29 however subsequent studies proved that latent infection by avian lymphomatosis viruses occurs in all chicken flocks and that by sexual maturity most birds are infected 30 32 statistics report an annual incidence of 2 3 lymphomatoses in some flocks yet these statistics include the more common lymphomas caused by mareks virus a herpes virus 33 34
1109362 viremia has a fast proliferative effect on hemopoietic cells and generates lympohoblast hyperplasia fig 1 32 36 37 hyperplasia appears to be necessary but not sufficient for later leukemogenesis because it does not lead to leukemia in tumor resistant birds 36
1109363 the murine leukemia viruses were also originally isolated from leukemic inbred mice 9 and subsequently detected as latent infections in most healthy mice 8 13 16 17 38 indeed about 0 5 of the dna of a normal mouse is estimated to be proviral dna of endogenous retroviruses corresponding to 500 proviral equivalents per cell 18 nevertheless leukemia in feral mice is apparently very rare for instance low virus expression but not a single leukemia was recorded in 20 of wild mice 3 probably because wild mice restrict virus expression and thus never become viremic and leukemic however in an inbred stock of feral mice predisposed to lymphoma and paralysis 90 were viremic from an early age of which 5 developed lymphomas at about 18 months 3
1109364 experimental infections of newborn inbred mice with appropriate strains of murine leukemia viruses induce chronic viremias such viremic mice develop leukemias with probablilities of 0 90 depending on the mouse strain however if mice that are susceptible to leukemogenesis are infected by the time they are immunocompetent or are protected by maternal antibodies if infected as neonates no chronic viremia and essentially no leukemia are observed although a latent infection is established 41
1109365 the evidence that mammary carcinomas are transmissible by a milk borne virus mmtv indicates that the virus is an etiological factor 51 52 however the same virus is also endogenous but not expressed in most healthy mice 16 53 since no mammary tumors have been reported in wild mice the natural incidence must be very low but in mice bread for high incidence of mammary carcinomas it may rise to 90 13 16 54 55
1109366 feline leukemia virus was originally isolated from cats with lymphosarcoma 59 and subsequently from many healthy cats it is estimated that at least 50 60 of all cats become naturally infected with by feline leukemia viruses at some time during their lives 60 61
1109367 the bovine and human retroviruses associated with acute leukemias are always biochemically inactive or latent viremia which is frequently associated with a leukemia of congenitally or experimentally infected domestic chickens cats or inbred mice has never been observed in the bovine or human system accordingly bovine and human leukemia viruses could be isolated form certain leukemic cells only after cultivation in vitro away from the suppressive immune system of the host 71 72
1109368 htlv i or atlv was originally isolated from a human cell line derived from a patient with t cell leukemia 71 it replicates in cycling emphasis mine t cells 27 and also in endothelial cells 76 or fibroblasts 77
1109369 it is often pointed out that functional evidence for the virus cancer hypothesis is difficult to obtain in humans because experimental infection is not possible and thus kochs third postulate cannot be tested however this argument does not apply here since naturally and chronically infected asymptomatic human carriers are abundant yet most infections never lead to leukemias and none have been observed to cause viremias moreover not a single adult t cell leukemia was observed in recipients of blood transfusions from a virus positive donor 13 78 79 although recipients developed antiviral antibody 81
1109370 the incidence of adult t cell leukemia among japanese with antiviral immunity is estimated to be only 0 06 based on 339 cases of t cell leukemia among 600 000 antibody positive subjects 78
1109371 because of the nearly complete correlation between aids and immunity against the virus the virus is generally assumed to be the cause of aids 13 27 accordingly detection of antiviral antibody rather than virus is now most frequently used to diagnose aids and those at risk for aids 27 217 224 this is paradoxical since serum antibody from aids patients neutralizes aids virus 225 227 and since antiviral immunity or vaccination typically protects against viral disease it is even more paradoxical that a low antibody titer is equated with a low risk for aids 228 229
1109372 unlike all other retroviruses aids viruses are thought to be direct pathogens that kill their host cells namely t lymphocytes 13 27 and possibly cells of the brain 230 255 this view is compatible with the phenotype of aids the hallmark of which is a defect in t cells 13 27 215 and with experimental evidence that many but not all viral isolates induce cytopathic fusion of t lymphocytes under certain conditions in vitro section d further it is incompatible with neurological disease 231 232 255 however cell killing is incompatible with the obligatory requirement of mitosis for retrovirus replication 16 25 and with the complete absence of cytocidal effects in all asymptomatic infections in vivo section d
1109373 infections with no risk and low risk for aids indicate that the virus is not sufficient to cause aids
1109374 on the basis of this particular epidemiology it was concluded that the virus is not transmitted as cell free agent like pathogenic viruses but only by contacts that involve exchange of cells 13 27
1109375 in these virus infected groups the annual incidence of aids was found to average 0 3 224 and to reach peak values of 2 to 5 218 223 233 however even in these groups there are many more asymptomatic than symptomatic virus carriers
1109376 other infected groups appear to be at no risk for aids in haiti and in certain countries in africa antibody positive individuals range from 4 to 20 of the population whereas the incidence of aids is estimated at less than 0 01 223 229 234 several reports describe large samples of children from africa who were 20 22 to 60 221 antibody positive and of female prostitutes who were 66 to 80 antibody positive 221 235 yet none of these had aids among male homosexuals and hemophiliacs of hungary about 5 are aids virus positive yet no symptoms of aids were recorded 161 among native male and female indians of venezuela 3 3 to 13 3 have antiviral immunity but none have symptoms of aids 236 since these indians are totally isolated from the rest of the country in which only one hemophiliac was reported to be virus positive 236 the asymptomatic nature of their infections is not likely to be a consequence of a recent introduction of the virus into their population thus it is not probable that these infections will produce aids after the average latent period of 5 years section b
1109377 the eclipse period of aids virus replication in cell culture is on the order of several days very much like that of other retroviruses 238 in humans virus infection of a sufficient number of cells to elicit an antibody response appears to take less than 4 to 7 weeks this estimate is based on an accidental needle stick infection of a nurse who developed antibody 7 weeks later 239 and on reports describing 12 240 and 1 232 cases of male homosexuals who developed antibody 1 to 8 weeks after infection during this period a mononucleosis like illness associated with transient lymphoadenopathy was observed in contrast to aids see below this illness appeared 1 to 8 weeks after infection and lasted only 1 to 2 weeks until antiviral immunity was established the same early mononucleosis like disease associated with lymphocyte hyperplasia was observed by others in primary aids virus infections 234 this is reminiscent of the direct early pathogenic effects observed in animals infected with retroviruses prior to the onset of antiviral immunity part i section b
1109378 aids 5 10 or more years after infection as duesberg pointed out
1109379 by contrast the lag between infection and the appearance of aids is estimated from transfusion associated aids to be 2 to 7 years in adults 220 223 241 242 and 1 to 2 years in children from infected mothers 220 223 the most likely mean latent period was estimated to be 5 years in adults 220 223 unexpectedly most of the aids virus positive blood donors identified in transfusion associated aids transmission did not have aids when they donated blood and were reported to be in good health 6 years after the donation 220 likewise there is evidence that individuals shown to be antibody positive since 1972 have not developed aids 228 further 16 mothers of babies with aids did not have aids at the time of delivery but three of them developed aids years later 276 this indicates that the latent period may be longer than 5 years or that aids is not an obligatory consequence of infection
1109380 is that if not careful doctors can cause profound immune suppression through too much steroid administration
1109381 there are no published studies that show that drugs and drug effects are consistently associated with the development of aids
1109382 the trouble with duesbergs theory by marc b haefele editor los angeles alternative times
1109383 peter duesberg isolated the first cancer causing gene from a virus at 33
1109384 his idea died as most failed theories do never fully disproved but convincingly rebutted by the national institute for allergic and immune diseases and ultimately ignored by nearly everyone working in the field
1109385 and largely because duesberg a non physician kept peddling his theory as
1109386 he offers an easy comforting approach to aids and has been able to influence people to trust him and reject their doctors advice
1109387 as far as im concerned and i hope this view is adequately represented those who attempt to dispel the notion that hiv is the cause of aids are perpetrators of death and i would very much for one like to see the constitution of the united states and similar countries have some means in place that we can charge people who are responsible for endangering public health with charges of endangerment and bring them up on trial i think that people like peter duesberg belong in jail
1109388 the licensing study of azt performed in 1987 by the nih in collaboration with the drugs manufacturer burroughs wellcome in the us is the primary placebo controlled study set up to test the ability of azt to reduce the mortality of aids
1109389 greater emphasis on hiv infection status served to dramatically increase the number of aids cases over night many fold because healthy persons who presented with the molecular signature associated with
1109390 there are good reasons to doubt that htlv iii lav can be regarded as the exclusive single variable in the pathogenesis of aids there is therefore a spectrum of possibilities either it plays no role at all is of minor significance or it contributes significantly but not exclusively to the disease be that as it may the one major significant variable is the concurrent exposure of the patients to oxidising agents including sperm nitrites opiates and factor viii if this is true then prevention and possibly even cure may be achieved with the use of appropriate antioxidants
1109391 the most impressive developments of molecular genetics over the past 20 years do not make robert kochs postulates obsolete
1109392 concentrations of retroviruses from murine and avian leukemic tissue homogenates were reproducibly achieved permitting titration of infectivity into receptive laboratory animals this was not however an easy approach to the problem of virus purification large amounts of microvesicles and cell debris being usually present as far as virus purification was concerned it soon became evident that when viremia is present blood plasma was far better than tissue homogenates for efficient virus isolation and purification
1109393 in the case of rna tumor viruses now called retroviruses the demonstration of viremia in the blood plasma of experimental leukemic animals chickens and mice was published more than 35 years ago
1109394 but this conclusion was based on em findings and around 1970 the faith in retroviral oncology was assuming quasi religious proportions
1109395 when retrovirus particles are legion the study of molecular markers can be useful and provide an approach to quantification probably better than direct particle counting under the em which i always found very difficult but when using em retrovirus particles are absent relying exclusively on markers is a methodological nonsense markers of what
1109396 nevertheless for the past ten years hiv research and clinical therapeutic trials have been primarily based on the study of several hiv
1109397 more disturbing is the fact that some markers are searched for in the 1
1109398 in conclusion and after extensive reviewing of the current aids research literature the following statement appears inescapable neither electron microscopy nor molecular markers have so far permitted a scientifically sound demonstration of retrovirus isolation directly from aids patients
1109399 significant and potentially dangerous departure from our normal toxicology requirements
1109400 proven to be effective in hiv antibody positive asymptomatic and early arc patients
1109401 the government is reporting scientific facts before theyve been reviewed its unheard of
1109402 i dont know what to do i have to go in and face an office full of patients asking for azt im terrified i dont know what to do as a responsible physician the first study was ridiculous margaret fishl who has done both of these studies obviously doesnt know the first thing about clinical trials i dont trust her or the others theyre simply not good enough were being held hostage by second rate scientists we let them get away with the first disaster now theyre doing it again
1109403 might be a significant agent for many infectious diseases not just aids there is enough information to say that this agent is real
1109404 may be an important opportunistic infection if its real it could have an important impact on how doctors look at aids patients with unexplained problems
1109405 most investigators believe that acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids is caused solely by human immunodeficiency virus hiv 1 2
1109406 furthermore there is a logical problem that is often overlooked by uncritical hiv proponents aids patients die of previously identified diseases not of hiv infection per se that is why aids is a syndrome not a distinct disease entity thus the putative role of hiv is solely to cause the immunosuppression that sets the stage for subsequent fatal opportunistic infections but before we can accept hiv as the sole cause of immuosuppression characteristic of aids patients it is necessary to assure ourselves that alternative explanations of the data do not exist after all theories just like experiments need controls for just as experimental artifacts are reproducible so can a theory explain existing data and yet as aristotles theory of falling bodies demonstrates still not be the best explanation in the present context we must therefore before accepting hiv as the sole cause of the immunosuppression typifying aids demonstrate directly that hiv actually does cause immunosuppression in animals or human beings and also assure ourselves that other immunosuppressive agents cannot explain the etiology of aids in other words we must determine that the hiv theory is necessary and sufficient to explain aids and that no other theory is necessary or sufficient are there for example individuals who are immunosuppressed whose sole infection is hiv if so then we can assure ourselves that hiv is sufficient to cause immunosuppression do aids patients in general have any identified immunosuppressive risks other than hiv if so are these sufficient to explain the immunosuppression associated with aids in the absence of hiv or not
1109407 existing data do not as yet allow us to establish hiv as the unequivocal cause of immuosuppression in aids no nonhuman animal other than the chimpanzee appears to be infected by hiv and hiv infected chimpanzees do not display longterm immunological abnormalities 6 7 moreover all aids patients do have multiple well established causes of immuosuppression prior to concomitant with subsequent to and sometimes in the absence of hiv infection these immunosuppressive agenst are of seven basic types chronic or repeated infectious diseases caused by immunosuppressive microorganisms recreational and addictive drugs anesthetics antibiotics semen components blood and malnutrition while no aids patient is likely to encounter all of these agents all aids pateitns encounter several healthy heterosexuals and lesbians rarely encounter more than one therefore the conclusion that hiv is the sole cause of immunosuppression in aids and the sole factor differentiating aids patients from non aids patients cannot be maintained and alternative hypotheses remain possible
1109408 intravenous drug abusers also share an immunosuppressive risk factor with hemophilicas and blood transfusion recipients they receive other peoples blood i am unable to find any data concerning the immunological effects of small doses of untyped blood such as drug abusers might encounter repeatedly by sharing needles however it is a well established principle of immunology that repeated injections of very small amounts of almost any antigen eventually result in suppression of the immune response 72 given that these small repeated blood injection will include a proportion of leukocytes it is likely that immunosuppression to various hla types will eventually occur this mechanism of immunosuppression has previously been suggested for semen which also contains small numbers of leukocytes
1109409 in symptomatic patients with hiv infection early treatment with zidouvdine delays progression to aids but did not improve survival and was associated with more side effects there were 43 deaths 23 in the early therapy group and 20 in the late therapy group the medium time from the diagnosis of aids to death was 16 months in the early therapy group and 19 months in the late therapy group
1109410 the racial and ethnic groups appeared to respond differently to the timing of zidpovudine therapy fewer minority african american and hispanic patients died in the late therapy group two deaths than in the early therapy group nine deaths but the difference was not significant among non hispanic white patients early therapy significantly delayed the onset of aids but had no effect upon survival minority patients were much more likely than white patients to be intravenous drug users 40 vs 10 after two years of follow up we found no difference in survival between the two treatment groups
1109411 multicentre quality control of polymerase chain reaction viral load for detection of hiv dna
1109412 false positive and false negative results were observed in all laboratories concordance with serology ranged from 40 to 100
1109413 hivs molecular signature interact which might cause an autoimmune disease that targets the immune system
1109414 the results of concorde do not encourage the early use of zidovudine in symptom free hiv infected adults they also call into question the uncritical use of cd4 cell counts as a surrogate endpoint for assessment of benefit from long term antiretroviral therapy
1109415 find no evidence the dentists hiv positive patients contracted their infections from him because their virus dna did not match his and also concluded the dentists patients did not contract the virus from one another in effect that unclean dental implements did not act as conduits
1109416 if correct then an experimental animal model of aids should be induced in laboratory animals by infecting them at a low multiplicity with a very large number of diverse viruses one way of doing this would involve collecting the blood from a large number of wild mice from geographically distant locations mixing it together and injecting it into healthy mice the number of mice that would be required to produce such a lethal injection or series of injections is not predicted by this hypothesis although from the numbers suggested by the behavior patterns of the human victims of aids the number of individuals whose viruses must be pooled might be quite high the hypothesis suggests that some level of diverse infection would cause aids like malfunction of the immune system to appear rapidly and that this could not be reproduced by simply isolating a particular infectious specifies and infecting similar animals with only this species
1109417 the hypothesis also suggests that blood from a single human aids patient should be capable of transferring the appropriate level of diversity of infection to another organism given that the recipient organism contains a functional human immune system
1109418 the hypothesis suggests further that aliquots of an appropriate dilution of the blood from a single aids patient injected into a large number of experimental animals with a human immune system would not be able to produce aids like immune dysfunction in any one of them
1109419 clinical manifestations of ana antiviral nucleoside analogs such as azt toxicity it is self evident that anas like all drugs have side effects however the prevalent and at times serious ana mitochondrial toxic side effects are particularly broad ranging with respect to their tissue target and mechanisms of toxicity haematalogical toxicity anemia and other blood disorders myopathy muscle disorders cardiotoxicity heart disorders hepatic toxicity liver disorders peripheral neuropathy nerve damage
1109420 cell membrane vesicles are a major contaminant of gradient enriched human immunodeficiency virus type 1 preparations
1109421 microvesicles are a source of contaminating cellular proteins found in purified hiv 1 preparations
1109422 hivs pathogenic effect as raised by papadopulos eleopulos et al
1109423 identification and analysis of the virus are complicated by the presence of cellular membrane vesicles which copurify with the virus
1109424 we recently reported a proteolytic procedure ott et al 1995b that effectively removes greater than 95 of proteins associated with these membrane vesicles this procedure has allowed us to demonstrate that the cytoskeletal proteins actin ezrin moesin and cofilin are located in the interior of virions
1109425 pha activated human pbls were also shown to produce microvesicles that incorporated cellular proteins fig 6
1109426 in addition to proteins microvesicles were also shown to contain both rna and dna approximately 10ug of rna and 4 ug of dna were found per mg of protein the major rna species in microvesicles were ribosomal 28s and 18s subuitis and some low molecular species perhaps trna
1109427 clearly future experiments utilizing purified viruses must be carefully controlled to account for the effects of cellular antigens present on microvessels
1109428 numerous other cellular proteins have been identified in purified preparations of hiv 1 it is not known if these are physically associated with hiv particles and if so whether or not they have a role in the virus replication cycle identification of which cellular proteins are associated with the virus is a prerequisite to studying the potential function of cellular proteins in the virus replication cycle

1109432 abstract an immunopathologic study of normal and severely atrophic thymuses sta was undertaken in order to evaluate the expression of human retrovirus envelope and core molecules in thymic epithelial cells tec in hiv negative children both normal and ste thymuses disclosed p19 p24 p39 p45 and p55 viral core proteins as well as gp46 gp63 glycoprotein of envelope origin no evidence of gp160 gp120 and gp41 molecules were observed in tec which suggested endogenous lack of receptor molecules for hiv the results are discussed in the context of possible thymus oriented autoimmune reaction in hiv and non hiv bearing patients and in consequence severe injury of tec forming microenvironment
1109433 initially boni et al 1996 published that low level reverse transcriptase activity was detected in all chicken cell derived vaccines using a highly sensitive pcr based reverse transcriptase assay called pert which can detect one to ten virions which was reported to the who and then additional studies were done by several laboratories in europe as well as the u s including the nibsc the cdc as well as labs in the fda to confirm this initial finding however after further work it was discovered that this reverse transcriptase activity could be eliminated by treatment of extracts with dnaase and that using alu based eav sequence integration studies that no integration of anything derived from the chicken cell supernatants was detected in human pbmc cells

1109435 south africa researchers hoping to find a way for women to protect
1109436 we were dismayed to find out that the group using the n 9 gel had a higher rate of hiv infection than the group using a placebo
1109437 the long term safety of nonoxynol 9 as a family planning method may have to be re evaluated
1109438 i think this may be the end of nonoxynol 9 as a potential microbicide
1109439 i think its pretty clear we have to tell men who have sex with men not to use it
1109440 i think they are most at risk and i know they are using it
1109441 one possible reason for the findings was that the women who used the spermicide had more lesions than the women who did not
1109442 if you use nonoxynol 9 to protect from hiv you are probably wasting your money you may possibly be wasting your life
1109443 there is nothing in this trial to suggest you should stop using it as a spermicide
1109444 this shouldnt be the end of the field one of the things holding up development increasingly is a lack of private sector interest in this area
1109445 a total of 16 microbicides a gel or cream used to block infection are currently being evaluated of those five are in major advanced studies drug trials into oral prevention drugs are also underway
1109446 its also irrational stigma makes it easier for political leaders to stand in the way of saving lives
1109447 hivs molecular signature most accurately 44 it is significant that 8 of the 12 pcr tests initially detected with elisas seroconverted within several months thereby obtaining a consistent molecular signature in 8 12 cases out of 37 million negatives

1109451 number 6 it is now accepted as unassailable truth that people in treatment need nutritious food supplements to maintain and tolerate their treatment and yet there is a growing clamour from people living with aids that decent nutrition simply isnt available leaving them in a desperate predicament the world food programme released a study at this conference calculating the cost of food supplementation at 66 cents a day for an entire family what madness is it that denies the world food programme the necessary money

1109458 a total recall of an important aids drug widely used in developing countries has disrupted treatment for tens of thousands of the worlds poorest patients with no clear word from the manufacturer on when shipments will resume
1109459 the recall of the drug viracept by roche pharmaceuticals of switzerland went largely unnoticed in the developed world when it was announced in early june after the company had discovered that some batches made at its swiss plant contained a dangerous chemical but the recall has caused growing concern among global health officials and in aids programs in many poor nations they say the company did an inadequate job of informing patients and officials about the potential risks and helping them find affordable access to newer alternative drugs
1109460 during the past 20 years hiv aids research has shown to a line of critical scientists again and again that the existence of hiv has not been proven without doubt and that both from a aetiological causal and a epidemiological view it can not be responsible for the immunodeficiency aids in view of the general accepted hiv aids hypothesis this appeared to me so unbelievable that i decided to investigate it myself after three years of intensive and above all critical studies of the relevant original literature as an experienced virologist and molecular biologist i came to the following surprising conclusion up to today there is actually no single scientifically really convincing evidence for the existence of hiv not even once such a retrovirus has been isolated and purified by the methods of classical virology
1109461 have you now or ever been someone who dared ask a question regarding the reality and pathogenesis of
1109462 and sir do you know anyone especially scientists or physicians who have asked such a question could we please have their names now
1109463 many lessons can be drawn from this early intense period and most suggest that science requires greater modesty

1109468 office of scientific integrity at the national institute of health to analyze archival samples established at the pasteur institute and the laboratory of tumour cell biology ltcb at the national cancer institute between 1983 and 1985
1109469 37 coded archival samples associated with the isolation of hiv 1 lai lav and hiv 1 lai iiib
1109470 goals were to determine which hiv 1 variants were present in the samples and the sequence diversity among hiv 1 isolates from the earliest stages of the aids epidemic
1109471 the striking similarity between the first two hiv 1 isolates lai lav formerly lav isolated at the pasteur institute 1 2 and lai iiib formerly htlv iiib reported to be isolated from a pooled culture at the ltcb provoked considerable controversy in light of the high level of variability found among subsequent isolates
1109472 we concluded that the ltcb pool and probably another ltcb culture were contaminated between october 1983 and early 1984 by variants of hiv 1 lai from the
1109473 culture sent to ltcb in september 1983 therefore the origin of hiv 1 lai iiib isolate was patient lai

1109476 o you who believe obey allaah and his messenger and turn not away from him i e messenger muhammad sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam while you are hearing and be not like those who say we have heard but they hear not
1109477 the only saying of the faithful believers when they are called to allaah his words the quraan and his messenger sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam to judge between them is that they say we hear and we obey and such are the prosperous ones who will live forever in paradise

1109480 yazeed was from the teenage muslims he was neither a disbeliever nor a zindeeq heretic he used to give a lot of wealth in charity and he was brave he did not have the evil and bad things which the enemies attribute to him
1109481 this man yazeed was a king from amongst the muslim kings and he was not like this and that as the people claim
1109482 rather the islaam of muawiyyah yazeed banee ummayyah and banee abbaas is established with tawatur ie so many narrations and similarly their praying fasting and jihaad against the non believers is also established
1109483 attributing fisq open sinning and disbelief to yazeed ibn muawiyyah is unlawful haraam and considering this to be lawful ie these attributions to him are unlawful haraam
1109484 a majority of the companions were with yazeed and they did not hold it permissible to rebel against him

1109512 all the scholars of hadeeth muhadditheen are agreed upon his trustworthiness muhammad ibn eesaa bin soorah bin shadaad al haafidh
1109513 i heard from umar bin alk who said when imaam bukhaaree died he left no man behind him as abu eesaa in knowledge memory piety and righteousness he would cry so much due to the fear of allaah that he became blind and he remained alive for a number of years in this state
1109514 the pronouncement of the word tirmidh with taa and meem became so much so that it began reaching the level of tawatur
1109515 abu eesa compiled the knowledge of hadeeth and authored books in this field and preserved them by his memory and re itterated
1109516 we have not seen a scholar of hadeeth like you
1109517 once on the way to makkah i wrote two parts of a hadeeth of a shaykh coincidently i met him so i asked him to narrate the ahaadeeth which he accepted i had thought i had written the two parts but unfortunately i had both parts of paper in my hand without anything written on them the shaykh recited the ahaadeeth and he saw the two parts in my hand and said are you not ashamed so i explained the events and told him not to worry and your efforts are not wasted i have memorised all the ahaadeeth you have narrated but he did not believe me and said recite them so i recited them but he was still not saisfied and said you had memorised them from before so i said narrate some other ahaadeeth and we will see so he narrated a further 40 ahaadeeth and i recited them all back to him without the mistake of a single letter

1109521 when i authored this work i presented it to the scholars of hijaaz araaq and khurasaan all of them read it and liked it whoever has this book in his house i e jaami tirmidhee then it is as if the prophet sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam is talking himself
1109522 there are four types of ahaadeeth in jaami tirmidhee 1 their authenticity is certain
1109523 i have not transmitted any such hadeeth in my book upon which a faqeeh did not act
1109524 what pity the allaamah was unable to complete this explanation during his life
1109525 my heart supplicates dearly that this book is printed quickly in the manner of the previous volumes it is an invalubale gift of knowledge for the scholars of ahlul hadeeth

1109648 what precise form did sexual activity assume in eden in this practice of homosexual fist fucking the man usually associated with active penetration must open himself up passively he is penetrated in the regiion in which closure resistance to penetration is the natural reaction one knows that the difciculty of fist fucking is more psycbnhological than physical the difficulty lies in relaxing the anal muscles enough to allow the partners fist to penetrate the position of the fisted one in fist fucking is perhaps the most intense experience of passive opening available to human experience on top of this opening oneself up to the other whose organ literally enters my body and explores it from within the other crucial feature is that this organ precisely is not the phallus as in normal anal intercourse but the fist hand the organ par excellence not of spontaneous pleasure but of instrumental activity of work and exploration

1109702 divine droplets an amazingly complex bottle of wine came about because the literal translation of the sake did not have a name that was appealing for sales the actual translation was drips all night they decided that to market the product it was probably better to give it a little nicer name

1109786 the childrens section of this site introduces them to the important concept of saving energy through three exciting interactive games that are designed to teach 1 what is energy waste 2 how can you prevent energy waste 3 why are we saving energy

1109788 velvety rich meets fine powder finishes for a matte like nothing you remember
1109789 i pretty much persuaded the organizers how much fun it would be to do a 12 hour race
1109790 theres a whole slew of 24s but theres only one other 12 hour race in colorado the 12 hour format is a relatively new format it doesnt require as much energy or time for everyone thats involved and its still a lot of fun
1109791 they know their community and this is a way to involve that community in a cool new event
1109792 we wanted to attract intermediate and beginner riders doing a 24 hour race is a bigger commitment both from organizers and riders its a bigger investment with lights and timers and a bigger time commitment for those competing this way youre not so tired and exhausted at the end of the event you can still enjoy your weekend
1109793 if someone was coming not from elevation and not used to a ski area venue they might consider it tougher than intermediate
1109794 there are parts of this course that are expert lines there might be some downhill and uphill sections that some people might feel more comfortable walking

1109800 we believe that bhp billiton and rio tinto have a legal obligation to allow rail haulage to third parties under their various state agreements and that this would lead to a healthy diversification of the iron ore industry in the pilbara and better social and economic outcomes for its residents and the nation as a whole
1109801 if fair and equitable infrastructure access is not granted some mine sites would not be financially viable or production could be severely limited due to the environmental social financial and potential licensing restrictions relative to the trucking of iron ore
1109802 further the state government has a clear policy preference towards rail over road transport
1109803 the four members of the north west iron bc iron brockman resources and ferraus therefore have an obligation to their shareholders to negotiate a workable solution for the transportation and shipment of their ore through the pilbara
1109804 we have been very encouraged by the draft praic regime and ncc recommendation and look forward to providing further input towards the final outcomes through the responses we have submitted
1109805 it is important that the interests of all parties are balanced and that there is an independent body to ensure that this balance is maintained
1109806 the north west iron ore alliance therefore supports the need for a strong regulator who would be responsible not only for approving such factors as the pricing and costing of the rail haulage regime as but also for key issues such as capacity and service level principles safety principles and capacity modelling principles
1109807 confident that its arrangements are in all respects in conformity with guinean laws and that it has complied with its obligations
1109808 looking at the expansion projects we have and what other players are doing we dont see the level of ore demand will be down for the next 2 3 years
1109809 so what we are doing is to find that option that gets iron ore closer what we are doing is to stimulate steelmakers to build larger ships
1109810 were trying to correct it not the premium but the freight rates
1109811 im not happy with the freight levels i dont think they represent the actual cost of transportation
1109812 im doing my best to be nice to you and grin through the pain you want to talk to me for 20 minutes about your frumpy little purse i dont give a rats ass about your purse can we move on please
1109813 there is a ditch on either side of the road
1109814 we have now achieved four successive resource upgrades for karara within the space of three years with the indicated and inferred resource doubling again from the previous resource as at september 2007 to the current level of 1 85 billion tonnes
1109815 in addition we have now defined an ore reserve over and above these indicated and inferred resources of greater than half a billion tonnes
1109816 this demonstrates clearly that karara will sustain a long life operation at the expanded 12mtpa production rate currently being examined as well as potential future expansions above this production level
1109817 the revised mineral resource and ore reserve inventory would support over a 100 year plus mine life at the 8mtpa production rate currently contemplated and 75 plus years at the expanded 12mtpa production rate
1109818 the more work we do on this deposit the better it is found to be there has been improvement even in parameters such as the waste to ore strip ratio which means a corresponding reduction in mining costs it is also worth noting that based on the conversion and concentrate production parameters achieved the revised resource and reserve equates to over 900 million tonnes of high grade magnetite concentrate grading over 68 fe making this deposit equivalent to or better than some of the biggest hematite deposits in terms of potential iron ore product production in the world
1109819 the market dynamics will allow us to reach these numbers this year
