7360062 but we have to be modest and sober minded and we have to face the difficulties and challenges in the process of future development
7360063 we are still lagging behind in many events or disciplines in terms of medal count and in terms of the number of athletes who ranked in the first eight we are still lagging behind compared with many developed countries

7360066 the coast guard announced today it is sending eight cutters 600 people to the persian gulf which i understand is the first time they have been dispatched to a combat zone since the vietnam war whats the thinking behind that and whats their mission going to be

7360074 councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
7360075 i can see it wont be long before well be taken off the streets to be weighed and measured and sent to fat camps to slim if we dont measure up we need to take a stand
7360076 these fat children who thanks to the government the in society and weight loss marketers are loathed derided and looked upon with disgust it will only open the door to more abuse and less affection for these children
7360077 kids are being told dont run youll fall and hurt yourself dont ride your bike there are predators out there dont play tag someone will get hurt organized sports are bad because they hurt peoples feelings is it any wonder why the kids are fat
7360078 is probably a whole lot more damaging for the child than merely being fat
7360079 it is nice to know government has finally stopped crime dead in its tracks and have begun to tackle the real issues
7360080 about five perhaps ten parents need to be publicly whipped for letting their precious snowflakes get so fat

7360119 in the 1990s the gazan fishing industry produced an annual income of around 5m that had halved by 2007 and is still shrinking fast under the oslo accords which in 1993 were supposed to herald the coming of an independent palestinian state gazan fishermen were to be allowed 20 nautical miles out to sea where they could catch sardine as they migrated from the nile delta up towards turkey during the spring but israeli naval ships in recent years have imposed their own much reduced limits sometimes fewer than 6 miles out
7360120 what gives israel the right to take away the livelihood of these fishermen and why does the world allow them to destroy an industry that used to provide for thousands of palestinians
7360121 we intend to challenge that right backed up by warships and machine guns just as we challenged israels right to prevent us from coming here on saturday
7360122 we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well he told abc radio today
7360123 therefore youve got to take a hard line approach to this so theres conditionality which is that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments that the regular attendance at school by their kids as a necessary pre condition we think thats the right way to go

7360129 una ense anza y un esp ritu que es lo que caretas representa
7360130 este es un mal d a porque con el alejamiento de doris gibson parece cerrarse todo un cap tulo y una hermosa y gran leyenda de nuestro pa s de quienes no tuvimos la suerte generacional de conocerla si vivimos de esa leyenda y aprendimos su inmenso ejemplo
7360131 pero aprendimos tambi n adversarios por momentos y en otro tiempo siempre buenos lectores de caretas una l nea que solo puede provenir de la fusi n de dos sangres po ticas la de los gibson y de los parra del riego que es la l nea de la libertad

7360139 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

7360145 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7360146 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7360147 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7360148 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7360149 they wont let the economic statement through the senate and now theyre apparently demanding another statement

7360151 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears

7360160 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7360161 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7360162 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7360163 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7360164 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside

7360203 the survey highlights some key challenges organisations need to address including user education inadequate security policies and the broad brush access rights policies typical in many enterprises today all too often employees simply do not know which information is confidential within the remit of public domain or of restricted distribution even if the regulations were clear employees are often unaware of the corporate policy around such information a majority of data leaks happen from within either by accident or by design by valid users who have access to the data within a corporate network this can trigger fines litigation brand damage and bad press so its no surprise that data leaks are becoming such an important issue for companies
7360204 enterprises need to carry out effective identification and classification of information assets and intellectual property identify access rights to information as well as gain an understanding of potential routes for information going into around and out of the organisation a risk assessment of what happens when that data is exposed allows organisations to create a workable and importantly an enforceable data security policy and ultimately educate the workforce in the application of that policy on an ongoing basis

7360259 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7360260 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade

7360264 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7360265 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market

7360352 foi um jogo igual e taticamente os dois marcaram forte nenhum jogador se destacou no jogo o que me agradou foram os dois gols e poder amos ter feito mais o que n o me agradou foi a falta de aten o no primeiro gol deles

7360375 he was an expert at testing the rules to the limit and i wouldnt swear that he stuck rigidly to the rules on not drinking smoking or breaking bounds but he was a live wire and fun to have around
7360376 he was intensely argumentative and every school rule was questioned he could uphold his side of the debate about the rights and wrongs of everything better than any boy in the school
7360377 tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime
7360378 i didnt come into politics to change the labour party i came into politics to change the country
7360379 to win power for the low paid unemployed and the north we must also appeal to the 60 of the population in private housing to the employed on the average wage and to the south
7360380 i think most people who have dealt with me think im a pretty straight kind of guy and i am
7360381 power without principle is barren but principle without power is futile this is a party of government and i will lead it as party of government
7360382 im worried about that young man hes getting awfully bossy
7360383 the prime minister headed the most two faced interfering over regulating bossy intolerant arrogant and crony run government in britains history
7360384 a person who calls for gordon brown to be sacked and whose economic politics do not stand up has a total disregard for sensible mature politics that person would be a disaster for labour and a disaster for london
7360385 i believe passionately i may be wrong but this is my genuine belief that he would be a disaster for london but at least in a sense hes not my responsibility any more
7360386 my prediction that he would be a disaster has turned out to be wrong and i think when that happens in politics you should just be open about it if the facts change you should be big enough in politics to say your mind changes
7360387 why does he not split the job of mayor of london the former health secretary frank dobson can run as his day mayor and the hon member for brent east ken livingstone can run as his night mayor
7360388 tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime
7360389 ask me my three main priorities for government and i tell you education education education

7360391 terminator blair romps home and casts hagues tories into election oblivion
7360392 just after the election an old colleague of mine said come on tony now we have won again cant we drop all this new labour and do what we believe in
7360393 its not a day for sort of soundbites really we can leave those at home but i feel the hand of history upon our shoulder
7360394 dont believe anyone who says the british people dont care about the peace process people in my country care deeply about it are willing it to work and in our two countries it is not just the politicians who have a role to play no one should ignore the injustices of the past or the lessons of history but too often between us one persons history has been another persons myth we need not be prisoners of our history
7360395 true friend of peace and a true friend of ireland
7360396 the true determination that he had for just sticking with it for 10 tough years
7360397 you have been very rude and i have never been spoken to like this before
7360398 africa is worth fighting for europe in its present form is not
7360399 and our job my nation that watched you grow that you fought alongside and now fights alongside you that takes enormous pride in our alliance and great affection in our common bond our job is to be there with you you are not going to be alone
7360400 ive heard hes been called bushs poodle hes bigger than that this is just background noise a distraction from big things somehow our relationship has been seen as bush saying to blair jump and blair saying how high but thats just not the way it works its a relationship where we say were both going to jump together
7360401 we were with you at the first we will stay with you till the last
7360402 as britain knows all predominant power seems for a time invincible but in fact it is transient
7360403 the longest period of economic growth since records began an economy now bigger than that of italy and france the lowest unemployment and highest employment rate of any of our competitors for the first time since the 1950s living standards up for everyone and for the poorest up most the biggest reductions in child poverty and biggest increases in investment for decades
7360404 this is not the time to falter this is the time for this house not just this government or indeed this prime minister but for this house to give a lead to show that we will stand up for what we know to be right to show that we will confront the tyrannies and dictatorships and terrorists who put our way of life at risk to show at the moment of decision that we have the courage to do the right thing
7360405 we are supposed to admire the prime minister because he is a man without doubts and one shorn of scepticism two of the greatest qualities that the british people have he just knows that he is right and is therefore prepared to ignore the advice of virtually all the leaders of the great religions in the world including the pope and our own archbishop i find that approach rather frightening
7360406 tony blair has made it known in connection with his part in the iraqi war that he is ready to meet his maker whether his maker is ready to meet tony blair is another matter in gods sandals i think i should plead a previous engagement
7360407 i am truly sorry about the dangers that they face today in iraq and afghanistan i know that some may think that they face these dangers in vain i do not and i never will i believe that they are fighting for the security of this country and the wider world against people who would destroy our way of life
7360408 has repeatedly warned iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations
7360409 i have come to the conclusion after much reluctance that the greater danger to the un is inaction that to pass resolution 1441 and then refuse to enforce it would do the most deadly damage to the uns future strength confirming it as an instrument of diplomacy but not of action forcing nations down the very unilateralist path we wish to avoid

7360413 my apologies to you for the times ive fallen short but good luck
7360414 tony blair gave a brilliant farewell demonstration of the gifts that have enabled him to dominate politics for such a preposterous length of time his lethal blend of self righteousness good manners and amiability permitted him to control his last appearance as prime minister and turn it into a celebration of himself

7360464 about flying cars to me flying is not maglev or air cushion
7360465 the home computer in 1999 a hilarious representation of the future and just as accurate from 1967
7360466 it is a sad thing we no longer predict greater future for ourselves

7360495 i wisht id saved a bit of that elixir for the rest of us
7360496 more of that greasy grace the neos love to sing about
7360497 we think the aircraft in future will be capable of weeks or months duration
7360498 i think it will be a worry for anyone thats not ideal that situation where weve got guys with carry over points but we play in a very volatile and aggressive sport
7360499 and we ask our players to play tough hard footy and sometimes that drags them a little bit close to the line so they are vulnerable to reports and suspensions
7360500 but over the course of the last 10 to 12 weeks our players have been pretty good
7360501 weve looked at a lot of other sides not just teams we play in the present era but previous sides that were very successful in september who have had a number of players that were able to float from forward to back
7360502 he is such an aggressive competitor and he has such great leg speed and they are usually the traits you like in your back half and thats why weve played him there for the bulk of the past two or three seasons
7360503 but we didnt want him pigeon holed as a defender for the rest of his career because we think hes got some key attributes that can help us from time to time
7360504 it is ironic that the guy who had the least amount of possessions on the oval probably had the greatest influence on the contest and in my view that was campbell brown
7360505 any series we have with new york is going to be a big series but when we come off of a win like this i feel like everyone will show up and just have a little more energy and be able to feed off this game
7360506 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7360507 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7360508 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7360509 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it
7360510 hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub
7360511 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7360512 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7360513 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7360514 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7360515 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch
7360516 we brought down a budget in may the centrepiece of which was a 22 billion surplus and in terms of macro economic responsibility it was absolutely the right thing to do
7360517 it provided the buffer to act in the future against uncertain global economic times brought about by the global financial crisis the global hike in oil prices and whats happening with food prices
7360518 if i was dr nelson what i would be saying is lets get behind this its sensible for the countrys long term economic future
7360519 i mean the liberal party is punching a big hole in the budget surplus in the senate they wont let the economic statement through the senate now theyre demanding another statement
7360520 this weeks sittings of parliament are a test of the liberal partys economic credibility
7360521 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the government will fight for the integrity of our budget
7360522 one of the most important things is that it gives a sense of comfort its a safe place to be scared if you like i think people also like the crime novel because it challenges them
7360523 we missed our shot now hes gonna be at us
7360524 the sense of his own beauty comes on him like a revelation
7360525 i am determined to work with the football associations and the international olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7360526 ive put an option on the table im sure the prime minister wants to ensure scotlands future as an international footballing nation lets have the debate
7360527 who on earth would really want to jeopardise or sacrifice the future of scotland as an international football country so we could have a couple of players in an under 23 team in four years time

7360543 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7360544 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7360545 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7360546 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7360547 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid
7360548 i dont believe we will succeed in bringing the corpses back
7360549 because they ended up in a zone of high risk with unstable ice pillars which have a high risk of collapse at the most we might be able to survey the area to see whether some signs of the presence of the bodies have emerged the only certain thing is that these people are beyond hope of being rescued
7360550 they were not hit by the avalanche they are alive and unhurt
7360551 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7360552 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7360553 i am determined to work with the football associations and the international olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing

7360610 gai what did i tell you about interrupting me when im at the stone
7360611 yes but i came up with a youthful challenge this morning that simply could not wait
7360612 hold on a minute this morning werent you training with your team this morning
7360613 yes well we finished early this morning but i wasnt done so i thought
7360614 youre never done early this has something to do with lee doesnt it
7360615 ill tell you later but i really did come to spar
7360616 geez gai watch it would ya someone could get hurt
7360617 i knew youd dodge it youre so hip and modern after all
7360618 are we going to fight or are you planning on standing there all day
7360619 well thats that then i think you owe me an explanation now
7360620 do you have to bring that up now i was kind of enjoying just lying here
7360621 really and i suppose you smell like a bed of roses
7360622 its not that humans just smell really bad when they sweat
7360623 alright so something has happened but nothing major i mean its something i can deny im just not sure that i want to which is frustrating since i know theres no hope
7360624 aw pity at least then hed have realized that you feel the same way he does and then things might work out
7360625 how many times must we go over this lee does not feel the same way about me at all and the fact that you keep saying he does proves that youre not nearly as much of a genius as you think you are
7360626 well youll never know unless you jump him will you whats wrong with just taking a chance
7360627 you mean other than the fact that he could end up hating me forever and our whole relationship would be utterly destroyed
7360628 oh i dont know maybe the fact that im dangerous
7360629 what does it matter if you turn into a terrifying monster once a month so does every woman in the world
7360630 its just not that simple kakashi i dont want lee to be hurt
7360631 no you just dont want him to find out if you didnt want him getting hurt youd go ahead and admit your feelings so he can stop worrying
7360632 look gai either give the kid a chance or sit around moping for the rest of your life but i really think you should choose the first one seeing as youre probably going to love him forever
7360633 exactly a bond that a werewolf feels is much stronger than anything a human has meaning even if lee did feel that way it wouldnt be nearly as strong most likely hed end up trapped in a relationship hed be afraid to break because of how much damage that would do to me i cant put him through that lee deserves to be happy
7360634 kakashi nearly yelled leaning forwards to get in gais face

7360639 the next state government must put in place a human capital strategy that addresses current and predicted labour shortages

7360643 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killing in recent times
7360644 our goal is not only to see justice served but to protect law abiding citizens on both sides of the border from this type of senseless violence
7360645 the political process has not been able to defuse the situation and now were at a very critical point where we have a very disturbing communal divide
7360646 a matter of almost trifling significance has been allowed to swell
7360647 the government was simply out of sync with the mood in kashmir the implications of the land transfer on the psyche of the people in kashmir and the impact of the revocation on hindus
7360648 has wiped out the huge gains made politically in the region in the last seven to eight years
7360649 governments inept handling and the bjps cynical exploitation of the crisis
7360650 what militants failed to do in kashmir since 1989 the government and the bjp have achieved for them
7360651 illustrated its ineptitude in the casual manner in which it watched without intervening

7360659 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7360660 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7360661 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7360662 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care

7360671 i have already read one of the books that will be released next year the secret valley and i can say that it is very much in enid blytons original style in fact i defy anyone to know that it is not actually enid blyton writing
7360672 blytons stories have been enjoyed by millions over the years and there is a huge demand for more of her magical storytelling blyton was passionate in her advocacy of child literacy and as the guardians of her estate we see it as our duty to continue that legacy

7360677 t he party asserting laches as a defense must present evidence demonstrating prejudice from a lapse of time such as that a witness has died or become unavailable that substantiating records were lost or that the defendant has changed her position in anticipation the opposing party has waived his claims
7360678 t he question of laches is factual and is determined by examining the circumstances of each case
7360679 what is sauce for the goose the plaintiff seeking to extend the statute of limitations is sauce for the gander the defendant seeking to contract it
7360680 the judicially created doctrine of laches to bar a federal statutory claim that has been timely filed under an express statute of limitations
7360681 although it is possible in rare cases that a statute of limitations can be cut short by the doctrine of laches we see no reason to supplant the statute of limitations in this case
7360682 arises only when one has so acted as to mislead another and the one thus misled has relied upon the action of the inducing party to his prejudice

7360688 i respectfully disagree that reviewers are overly critical of triple a titles and believe that the evidence in reviews of mgs4 grand theft auto iv call of duty 4 and bioshock backs me all of these are excellent games with big budgets critics gushed and gushed over each and practically apologized after pointing out any of their problems if mgs4 doesnt sell by the millions it wont be for scathing reviews the trouble if there is any lies in leading readers to believe that a videogame is the second coming even if it is a lower case fourth

7360693 you dont get in the music business just for the music its music girls and maybe a bit of drinking i was doing a lot of drugs when i was with bros plates of cocaine would go round at parties
7360694 i was growing up and made a lot of mistakes but the drug thing wasnt for me in the end when i left the band i was smoking a lot of weed but that didnt last long i lost about six months of my life from being in a haze and thought this is bulls t
7360695 it is definitely not put on its a very emotional show to work on you have a huge responsibility to a lot of people and everybody gets over emotional
7360696 its draining it takes so much out of you emotionally
7360697 i was like oh no i dont want to be different
7360698 she would make me take off my top and i would cry after five years of taking off your top you get used to it and youre not self conscious anymore
7360699 now she has a voice and she can use it for something good just opening her mouth about it is going to make thousands of women go get checked out it will probably save many lives
7360700 pues vaya mierda de telediario vamos a hacer hoy no lo salva ni una cat strofe
7360701 we talked to a couple of vendors and theyve indicated to us that if it was sent by plane it would take two to three weeks if it was by ship then usually three to four weeks
7360702 if we can get local communities involved in this process then we are really going to build not only on the strengths of getting rid of the animals and reducing that impact but were also really building that on the social outcomes so the strength in our community and increased sustainability of our pastoral areas
7360703 were really looking at the whole range of options and the approach that were taking is that theres potentially a value put on that pest or the removal of that pest
7360704 we brought down a budget in may the centrepiece of which was a 22 billion surplus and in terms of macro economic responsibility it was absolutely the right thing to do
7360705 it provided the buffer to act in the future against uncertain global economic times brought about by the global financial crisis the global hike in oil prices and whats happening with food prices
7360706 if i was dr nelson what i would be saying is lets get behind this its sensible for the countrys long term economic future
7360707 i mean the liberal party is punching a big hole in the budget surplus in the senate they wont let the economic statement through the senate now theyre demanding another statement
7360708 this weeks sittings of parliament are a test of the liberal partys economic credibility
7360709 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the government will fight for the integrity of our budget
7360710 basically we want to express disappointment to the government and this is a senior minister of the government whos coming here that we dont like the way that our lives are being changed here
7360711 my father had a volume of unreleased work that nobody knows about from the stax records days and beyond there was often too much material to release at the time but its still great music

7360713 i cant be negative like this what about others in a similar situation who may read my blog ill just discourage them
7360714 being reviled we bless being persecuted we endure being defamed we entreat
7360715 love your enemies bless those who curse you do good to those who hate you and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you
7360716 we must learn to not react this is just a corollary of turn the other cheek when somebody says something hurtful or somebody does something hurtful what is it thats being hurt its our ego nobody can truly hurt us they might cause some physical pain or emotional pain they might even kill our body but nobody can hurt our true selves no one can snatch you from the hands of the living god the scripture says john 10 28 we have to take responsibility for our own reactions then we can control our reactions there are a number of different levels to this principle on the most blatant level if someone hits you dont hit them back turn the other cheek thats the lords teaching now this is hard enough but there is a deeper level still because if somebody hits you and you dont hit them back but you resent them and you bear anger and hatred and bitterness against them youve still lost you have still sinned you have still broken your relationship with god because you bear that anger in your heart when we bear anger and resentment and bitterness in our hearts we erect barriers to gods grace within ourselves

7360724 let it never be said that dayton moore doesnt know how to fill out the back end of a pitching staff
7360725 you dont have to be at the convention to be involved
7360726 at a critical moment in our history americans will have their concerns addressed challenges listened to and their questions answered live by our countrys leaders we want americans to be at the center of this convention and americas town hall will allow us to do just that
7360727 prostitution related offences have always been very low priority that calls into question why we do this in the first place if theyre such low priority
7360728 unless the police are receiving complaints from the community theyre not going to act
7360729 there are too many deaths too many robberies too many rapes too many beatings which are a direct result of the law
7360730 that would be one significant factor why the numbers are down
7360731 there isnt that element that we say if its not bothering anyone we leave it alone
7360732 sex trade workers tend to recruit younger and younger individuals
7360733 were certainly on the fact that we could be dealing with children under 18 years of age out on the street
7360734 when youre on the street youre a nobody nobody cares about you
7360735 if you should be beaten up or robbed or raped and you go to the police its rather dicey whether they lay charges against the person or whether they think youre credible they may even end up charging you
7360736 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7360737 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7360738 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released

7360758 coalition forces are investigating these claims but have not been able to find any evidence that non combatants were killed in this engagement
7360759 the taliban and their supporters are running a very effective propaganda campaign to counter coalition efforts in western afghanistan
7360760 we did see an afghan woman and her child wounded in the crossfire being treated by an afghan commando and u s medics
7360761 and we saw them evacuated to a coalition hospital for treatment

7360765 today barack obama attacked john mccain for voting for the 2002 iraq war resolution joe biden also voted for the resolution
7360766 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destruction this is a guy whos destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with the iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient

7360774 a very large number of the clearance teams will be stopping by the end of this month if we dont get funds before that
7360775 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7360776 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7360777 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7360778 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7360779 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7360780 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7360781 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7360782 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7360783 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7360784 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7360785 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7360786 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7360787 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7360788 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7360789 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7360790 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7360791 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7360792 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7360793 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7360794 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7360795 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7360796 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7360797 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7360798 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7360799 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7360800 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7360801 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7360802 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7360803 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7360804 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7360805 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7360806 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7360807 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7360808 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7360809 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7360810 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7360811 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7360812 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7360813 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7360814 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7360815 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7360816 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7360817 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7360818 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7360819 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7360820 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7360821 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7360822 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7360823 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7360824 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7360825 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7360826 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7360827 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7360828 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7360829 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7360830 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7360831 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7360832 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future

7360844 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

7360884 he doesnt feel that way anymore i just talked with david the other day over breakfast at the beverly hills hotel and explained to him in great detail what we had planned for the show and he said he liked it and gave his approval

7360894 i think after the auckland game we talked about how our lineout had been going for the past 12 months prior rather than that one game hooker stephen moore said
7360895 you dont become a bad lineout overnight or a good lineout over night we talked about what wed done well in the first five or six games before that auckland test and went back to what we saw as our strengths and that worked for us
7360896 to lose vicks pretty early on we did a lot of work on our lineout throughout the week obviously with him running the show and for those guys to come in and hold it together for the rest of the game was full credit to jimmy horwill and to mummy as well when he came on moore said

7360925 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7360934 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7360935 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7360936 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7360937 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

7360942 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7360943 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7360944 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7360945 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7360946 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7360947 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7360951 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7360966 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7360967 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7360968 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia

7360972 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7360973 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7360974 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7360975 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7360976 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7360977 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7360978 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7360986 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7360987 and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us

7360995 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7360996 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7360997 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7360998 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7360999 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7361000 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7361001 this shouldnt be happening at all you will someday realize that you lost out on a big part of your familys life
7361002 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7361003 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7361004 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7361005 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7361006 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7361007 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7361014 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7361015 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7361016 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7361017 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7361018 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7361019 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7361020 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7361021 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7361022 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7361023 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7361024 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7361025 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7361026 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7361027 whatever is true whatever is honorable whatever is just whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is commendable if there is any excellence if there is anything worthy of praise think about these things
7361028 i think i may recall what one of those things is
7361029 well evaluate him on a daily basis but it wasnt that bad linehan said
7361030 the tough is that we have a limited week so were not going to be able to get out there in full pads for a whole of practice to get him as ready as youd like for the game linehan said
7361031 he will take snaps not only with the first unit but with the second unit and the third unit just to catch up on plays
7361032 as bad as i thought it would be were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
7361033 una volta qualche anno fa il papa di uno di noi che ora non c pi il pap di un angelo con il 24 sul cupolino e nel cuore ci ha definiti cosi
7361034 okay gotta go no time to cry here mom take a tissue i gotta run
7361035 we took over that place it was aww sum man
7361036 sundays thats the only fun part about the nfl to me
7361037 throughout the week its a job in the off season its a job everything that deals with football up until sunday is a job and a business on sundays thats the one time you get to put all that aside and just play the game
7361038 i love the challenge of it the play calling part of it the strategy the whole deal
7361039 its just a different feeling when you put your heart into something that you love doing the only other feeling like that for me is when im in church and getting excited just the energy sometimes i get the chills i feel it before every game
7361040 its all different depending on the time of the game
7361041 for a 1 oclock game everything is happening real fast you have to get up real early and you dont really have time to think about anything you prepare yourself the night before you make sure youre hydrated i really dont like night games because it seems like it takes forever to come around a 1 oclock game you wake up bam bam bam lets do it
7361042 i cant sit here and lie to you and tell you i dont the way we play were an aggressive defense so we have to be on our game at all times some opponents i definitely get a little nervous about its not a lack of confidence or preparation but you always want to go out and do your best and when a lot of pressure is put on you youre the guy that everybody is counting on
7361043 my hands are literally trembling but it has been that way for years for some odd reason ive been able to make an extra point almost feel the same way as a last second field goal its good for the last second field goal i dont think its so good for the extra point
7361044 most of the work is done during the week you exhaust it and then you get to the point where you just go ok im there im done and its over i go back through the game plan one more time sunday morning then drop it for a couple of hours and go over and play
7361045 and were laughing we may be laughing with the receivers and youll see guys with their ipods
7361046 i dont get into all that if the game comes down to a pregame speech youre probably going to get killed after the first hit those guys dont remember any of that stuff you get all that done during the week thats when you start building the bully by the time you get to game day then you just cut it loose
7361047 ive never gone into a game where i just felt like we were in trouble
7361048 i never felt that way i think its because as an offensive lineman you are playing against a better athlete 99 percent of the time and you find a way of beating that guy you just find a way to do it whether its by preparation angles whatever thats kind of the same approach i take with coaching games
7361049 when i get over to the stadium i get into the hot tub get a good stretch and then go out on the field and run around and get acclimated to the weather
7361050 when the officials give their two minute call i head out dodge a couple cheerleaders and try to get a couple more kicks in
7361051 im always the last guy called when they introduce the offense
7361052 you have to understand that youre going to have highs and lows
7361053 when you have highs you dont want to get overly excited and when you have lows you dont want to pull yourself down in the dumps you always have to have confidence that one play can get you back in your rhythm again
7361054 i always feel like my job out there is to get everyone involved in making plays and you want them to feed off making those plays so they bring energy to the huddle
7361055 some guys are good when theyre out of their mind hugh douglas was better that way for me that doesnt work ive got to stay focused on the job at hand blowing up doesnt help yelling at players and screaming at coaches thats not my deal it doesnt work for me and i dont think it works for the guys around me
7361056 i take it to heart because i know how much work we put in and its not a good feeling i usually talk about it for a couple of days me and brian westbrook talk about what we could have done or what we should have done
7361057 the whole next week is so much better with a win
7361058 everyone is in a better mood winning makes the bad things go away its the best kind of medicine you can take
7361059 the sick part of the game is whether you win or lose you go back and you analyze everything
7361060 its a weird deal but you do feel a lot better after wins than you do after losses my wife would probably tell you that after a loss im right back at the novacare complex im not good with that ill go home and try to hang out but im not good with it thats the only time i probably take stuff home

7361069 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7361070 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7361071 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7361072 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7361073 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7361074 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7361075 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class

7361077 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7361078 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7361079 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7361080 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much
7361081 a family is a place where minds come in contact with one another if these minds love one another the home will be as beautiful as a flower garden but if these minds get out of harmony with one another it is like a storm that plays havoc with the garden

7361094 to advance americas interests around the world and defeat this notion about our you know our bullying concept of freedom by letting people see what were about
7361095 people understand in a competitive world youve got to be fluent in the languages where business is booming and china is one of those places

7361105 ill predict right now tampa bay will win the southeast division
7361106 that would be their goal thats our prediction theres no guarantee but were predicting that were going to be there and compete
7361107 i dont think you can just judge success on if we win the division or not
7361108 i think our expectations are that were going to be entertaining show up to play every night play hard compete and be a good team overall thats how were going to judge success
7361109 hes got soft hands but other than that he doesnt have much speed
7361110 he won in the shootout so i gotta give him credit im not happy about it
7361111 i loved playing there and i loved living there but im sure with that first game the competitive spirit will come out im looking forward to that
7361112 i think the rivalry hasnt been where it should be just because both teams havent been good at the same time i think you might see that change floridas got some of the best defensemen in the league and i think we have some of the best forward you might see that increased rivalry accomplished
7361113 i used to be a 6 handicap and now im a 14 or 16 or something ive got to work on my game some here
7361114 i have a big job to do out here in victoria with my business
7361115 it happened a lot quicker than i thought it was going to but you have to have goals
7361116 youve got to work with people to get things done
7361117 that was rewarding to see them grow up to be young men
7361118 for such a young kid his composure dealing with pressure since he was so young
7361119 im impressed overall with his composure and the way he carries himself he comes from a really good family and i think thats going to help make his transition as a pro easier
7361120 weve got such a short window of opportunity well have three days before exhibitions start and then well be heading to europe it just makes everything easier to have it all at the forum and get going right away well get the new guys used to the arena because were going to be gone almost the whole preseason and then come back and play five in a row at home thats what were looking at there

7361123 they simply told us to get out of the car and started beating us with gun butts with sticks

7361126 it has been established beyond all doubt that oswald killed kennedy

7361131 scientific acoustical evidence establishes a high probability that two gunmen fired
7361132 i was looking at the president when the first shot was fired it missed the second shot hit the president in the back and the third shot hit him in the head
7361133 after we turned onto elm street i heard what i thought was a shot and then i heard i looked back to my right and two more shots or what i thought to be two more shots i heard asked if he saw the effects of the third shot
7361134 at first i thought it was a motorcycle backfiring as they were heating up the first shot apparently missed the limousine as it hit the curb not too far from where they mary moorman and jean hill were standing the second and third shots hit the president from the rear at the time i was facing east on elm with the grassy knoll to my immediate left and the corner of the stockade fence was less than 100 feet away i saw nothing on that hill that looked in any way suspicious im absolutely positive that there were only three shots that they all came from back up elm street from the right rear of the presidents limousine and that no one was shot from the grassy knoll
7361135 we had turned off of main street onto houston for one block then over to elm street then turned back left and we were stopped at the time before we heard the shots
7361136 when the first shot was fired i was looking directly at the president and i saw the concrete burst into a cloud of dust when the bullet hit the curb i noticed too that with the shot some people started running in every direction while several people hit the ground then while looking back at the president i heard the second shot the president became rigid and grabbed his neck it also seemed like the limousine stopped or almost stopped and agents from the following car started running toward the presidents limousine the third shot hit the president in the head
7361137 just as i turned around then the first shot went off
7361138 when the presidents car came around the corner i had a good view from about 150 feet
7361139 as the car was approaching i heard two shots boom boom and when the first shot was fired the president throwed his hands up like this demonstrating and at the time what we thought had happened somebody throwed firecrackers or something under the automobile and he was protecting his face

7361142 over 95 percent of the books on the case happen to be pro conspiracy and anti warren commission
7361143 so certainly there is a need for far more books on the other side to give a much better balance to the debate
7361144 an emotionally unhinged political malcontent who hated america and was as guilty as sin
7361145 i have not read the book in its entirety and do not intend to its point of view is plain as day and taking the time to dissect and expose its fallacies is for me an errand of too few returns
7361146 since we dont know what happened we should jump at what weve been told
7361147 since it doesnt add up as oswald something else most have happened

7361149 conspiracy icon vincent salandria for claiming that the killing of kennedy represented a coup d tat i suppose that since a coup d tat is defined as a sudden unconstitutional change of state policy and leadership by a group of persons in authority you couldnt even have a coup without the involvement cooperation and complicity of groups like the fbi cia and military industrial complex
7361150 this crazy incredibly childlike reasoning and mentality that has driven and informed virtually all of the pro conspiracy sentiment in the kennedy assassination from the beginning
7361151 according to bugliosi oswald is not just the murderer of kennedy he is the only one involved and he is nothing but
7361152 just cant believe that a nobody like oswald could kill a big man like kennedy
7361153 without attempting at this point the far more difficult and far less important task of saying which individuals did precisely what
7361154 comprehensive and fair evaluation of the entire case the theorists may not agree with my conclusions but in this work on the assassination i intend to set forth all of their main arguments and the way they not i want them to be set forth before i seek to demonstrate their invalidity i will not knowingly omit or distort anything
7361155 a lthough there have been hundreds of books on the jfk assassination
7361156 no book has even attempted to be a comprehensive and fair evaluation of the entire italics in original case including all of the major conspiracy theories
7361157 obviously has to have had a deleterious effect on the way americans view those who lead them and determine their destiny
7361158 bugliosi hasnt laid a glove on major elements of the case for conspiracy
7361159 the books use also lies in demonstrating that it may not be possible for one person to fully master or give a fair accounting of this impossibly tangled mess of a case
7361160 i couldnt help but notice the irony of ryans post he says that bugliosi admits the case is too big for one man to master and then claims it blows all the research of conspiracy theorists out of the water is this a joke it has to be right
7361161 you try to lump him together with posner while neglecting to mention that in
7361162 although his prosecutorial conclusions driven style is redolent of gerald posners in case closed the last attorney written book to defend the warren commission bugliosis endless self congratulation and his arrogant condescension make his book far more insufferable
7361163 comprehensive and fair evaluation of the entire case the theorists may not agree with my conclusions but in this work on the assassination i intend to set forth all of their main arguments and the way they not i want them to be set forth before i seek to demonstrate their invalidity i will not knowingly omit or distort anything
7361164 at 1 04 p m she stated and attested he stood at the bus stop where he could catch a bus going north 6
7361165 but that oswald was standing at a north bound stop at 1 04 certainly should have been considered by bugliosi
7361166 the actual evidence we now know shows two shots hit jfk in the head at zapruder frames 312 313 one from the front and one from the back with severely fragmenting soft metallic content whose gases and physical reactions exploded the skull at z337 339 blowing out the rear of the head
7361167 well theres no proof they had anything to do with anything
7361168 none of the slugs has been positively identified as coming from oswalds gun the same gun that had a misaligned firing pin in the theatre and was unable to discharge but supposedly discharged perfectly at the tippit scene

7361170 the paraffin test is not conclusive mere handling of a weapon may leave nitrates of the skin even without firing it
7361171 predictably the paraffin cast for oswalds right cheek showed no reaction
7361172 there is simply no way to square this with the testimony and experience of the dallas police and fbi
7361173 why in the world would these two dallas officers lie under oath about something like this
7361174 no one could really believe this is perjured testimony if for no other reason that no professional would lie under oath on a matter that he knows other experts could easily refute him on
7361175 by design revolvers can leak rifles depending on their construction and wear can also leak there is only one way to determine the leakage capacity of any weapon and that is to collect samples from the hands or face firing the weapon under controlled conditions while using the corresponding ammunition
7361176 did you recall how he lee harvey oswald was carrying the bag
7361177 yes sir he was carrying it parallel to his body
7361178 okay so he carried the bag right next to his body on the right side
7361179 was it cupped in his hand and under his armpit i think youve said that in the past
7361180 mr frazier is it true that you paid hardly any attention to this bag
7361181 so the bag could have been protruding out in front of his body and you wouldnt have been able to see it is that correct
7361182 with all due respect your words on the jfk assassination are a joke
7361183 every witness to the package supposedly carrying the rifle insisted the package was too small to have held a rifle looking for reasonable doubt there it is
7361184 i recall vaguely having seen lee oswald when he came to the work at about 8am and didnt see anything in his hands at the time

7361204 the indian art market is becoming global and indian artists are now featuring in international auctions quality indian art has an important edge over international art
7361205 some time ago i was speaking to a billionaire from italy who found an indian artist featured in one of the catalogues of a global auction
7361206 he said indian art was so inexpensive if he had to purchase similar work by an american artist he would have to purchase it for 1 million whereas he would be able to buy similar quality art for 50 000 from an indian artist
7361207 the economy has changed anyone can buy indian art be it a sheikh from dubai or collector from hong kong one does not go to the west to validate it
7361208 those were the times when our country was battling several issues and there was no one to validate art but not any more

7361229 the global nature of the collectors have changed most of them have made money on their own which has given an amount of self confidence they see good things about indian and chinese art on the front pages of newspapers and flock to the global sales
7361230 now you have celebrities collectors like charles saatchi and frank cohen buying indian art i am sure we will cross the chinese market in the next three to four years
7361231 they are more focused on quality and only the best are being picked up it has never happened in the art market before
7361232 this very important discovery not only helps us understand the genetic roots of this terrible disease but also has led to dramatically new ideas for curative therapy
7361233 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7361234 because there are already drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7361235 these survey results give some clear messages to both business and the government about protecting information to retain customer trust
7361236 youve got to be kidding me is she really this happy all the time is her marriage really that great is her faith truly that strong

7361238 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7361239 when were speaking with the government were speaking about everything from environmental issue that affect our business to energy supply within canada and abroad as well as capital and jobs and economic impact
7361240 when youre asking did we speak about the oil sands i think yes we would definitely have been speaking about the oil sands and our business
7361241 these kinds of meetings and exchanges happen all the time
7361242 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7361243 the minister took their views into consideration the government is proceeding with its turning the corner plan

7361247 i want to change the design of the community we havent designed it for the long run we created a lot of subdivisions with one road in and one road out
7361248 what i offer is effective knowledgeable and sincere leadership i live and breathe the everyday challenges of this district
7361249 the current county commissioners have forgotten who have elected them they are more of a tool they are pursuing their own personal agendas
7361250 i saw a lot of budget cutbacks theres a lot of uncertainty among the staff im someone that can bring consensus
7361251 unlike my opponents im not playing musical chairs jumping from one seat to another their experience has led our residents and our county to where we are today higher unemployment higher crime overcrowded streets overcrowded schools
7361252 we need to address roads a commuter rail is dear to my heart i want this to happen
7361253 when youre elected to do something by the voters you become their servant a standard youre held to
7361254 its something that came out of this office and it reflects on me
7361255 anytime an office has been run by the same people you start to limit ideas it becomes outdated its time for change
7361256 osceola county has already invested in training me and preparing me for this im ready to do the job

7361259 we were driven by a desire to modernise the unions image and modernise our communications
7361260 the tragedy is this can increase racial tension on the street and do little to stem the violence
7361261 when are we going to start saying this gang crime is a problem amongst a section of the black community and not for reasons of political correctness pretend it has nothing to do with it
7361262 deaths by fists knives and guns are becoming a regular feature of british news these murders must draw a line in the sand
7361263 it goes something like this you are a persistently under performing group you are six times more likely to be excluded from school and be a young offender you may already be in a gang or likely to join one the likely causes of your condition are absentee fathers absence of positive role models and being surrounded by women who cannot control or motivate you you aim too low and do not believe people like you can succeed
7361264 often these young men come from the same background as those who are underachieving at school or involved with the criminal justice system it is a sad fact that we seldom hear about these young people
7361265 we are a group of 14 year old boys from the reclaim project since the project started we have been approached by so many different newspapers magazines and tv companies most of who want to talk to us about guns and knives and gangs
7361266 honoring of the home state delegation of the is a convention tradition
7361267 the realisation came as a thunderbolt i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7361268 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7361269 during prime ministers questions she could rise from the front bench in an economic debate and recite the rate of inflation all the way back to william gladstone without a note
7361270 on any visit id pop into the kitchen to scan the noticeboard where her calendar was written out before going to see her in the sitting room
7361271 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7361272 when i invited a friend round to mums house for tea he engaged her in conversation about mikhail gorbachev quick as a flash she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging it was as if the dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall
7361273 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7361274 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7361275 dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead i had to keep giving her the sad news over and over again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7361276 it was pretty obvious when i last saw her in november 2005 that she was pretty off the map so to speak but like with reagan people give former heads of state some dignity because of the stigma attached
7361277 we know she has had small strokes and these lead to memory loss you can still have a conversation with her about contemporary politics dementia is a very emotive word which conjures up a very particular image in conversation thatcher may need a bit of occasional reminding but then so do we all
7361278 after all so many of them were in jail for things they actually had nothing to do with many were convicted by signing false statements under torture or under the flimsiest of evidence and were locked away for years
7361279 prisoners cant get jobs because of their convictions or even insurance or loans in some cases they cant get into countries like the us canada or australia so if they can wipe their record clean by proving that the convictions against them were unjust and flawed why not
7361280 but no similar mechanism to explore all the wrong doings that went on in the barracks and police stations
7361281 most of the loyalist prisoners just think its time to get on with their lives now that the conflict is over unlike republicans who want to prove a point about the state and its role in the troubles the loyalists are just happy to be free and living their lives again
7361282 the vaticans decision to move cardinal newmans body from its resting place is an act of grave robbery and religious desecration it violates newmans repeated wish to be buried for eternity with his life long partner ambrose st john
7361283 they have been together for more than 100 years and the vatican wants to disturb that peace to cover up the fact that cardinal newman loved a man its shameful dishonourable betrayal of newman by the gay hating catholic church
7361284 i dont think anyone disputes that cardinal newman deeply loved ambrose st john he did say after st john died that the grief is comparable to a husband losing a wife or wife losing a husband but he did not mean that the relationship with ambrose st john was a marriage like a gay relationship it is simply wrong to read back from todays categories into the victorian periods when these very intense passionate but totally celibate relationships in oxford and among the anglocatholic community were very common
7361285 i wish with all my heart to be buried in father ambrose st johns grave and i give this as my last my imperative will
7361286 oh yes our phone call you know i have had 12 other offers since then one was for 14 000
7361287 dont worry we made a deal at 7 900 and thats the price i accept from you
7361288 listen to haydns trios marvellous its all there you need nothing more
7361289 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7361290 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7361291 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7361292 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7361293 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions
7361294 two out of the five big pharmaceutical companies are allegedly looking into their pricing and if they are prepared to go back and look at the cost of their drugs to make them more cost effective then i welcome that
7361295 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever thank you to the people of china through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent these were truly exceptional games
7361296 ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all
7361297 part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
7361298 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards
7361299 therefore much of the money raised should be used to kickstart a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor
7361300 we were driven by a desire to modernise the unions image and modernise our communications
7361301 whilst the current level of bookings for summer 2008 is in line with forecasts the signs for 2009 are less clear cut
7361302 an increase in the number of insolvencies is an indicator of tougher trading conditions and may be an indication of a further deterioration later this year
7361303 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7361304 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7361305 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale
7361306 whatever the bbc says and does it will get it in the neck
7361307 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7361308 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7361309 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under
7361310 going to begin to pretend how the economics of this would work
7361311 have excelled magnificently at ping pong ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england and it was called whiff whaff
7361312 there you have i think the essential difference between us and the rest of the world other nations such as the french looked at the dining table and saw the opportunity to have dinner we looked at the dining table and saw an opportunity to play whiff whaff
7361313 that is why london is the sporting capital of the world i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home
7361314 it was very much more complicated than you might think
7361315 it was a wonderful moment for me and it is a very very big responsibility that now passes to us but i am absolutely sure that we are going to deliver an olympic games every bit as good in its way as the games we have just seen
7361316 i have talked to him about it i think he would have to be approached formally by the relevant authorities but he is one of the people mentioned and he has not turned it down
7361317 stop that shit im in charge i choose the songs
7361318 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally and in previous times was
7361319 the last decade has seen an ever increasing criminalisation of our young people
7361320 we shouldnt be locking them up for behaviour which isnt even necessarily criminal
7361321 we love you so much you have left a gap in our hearts and you will be missed every second of every day we will miss the sunshine that you brought to our lives we love you
7361322 i was devastated to learn that instead of celebrating london officially becoming the next olympic host in walthamstow we would be mourning the loss of another young life
7361323 i intend to call an urgent meeting of the leaders and mayors of the five host boroughs as host boroughs we must use the power of the games coming to east london to inspire change in our communities and change for our young people

7361329 with the number of final salary schemes plunging to a record low they have now become gold dust for those employees who still have them employers can turn this to their advantage because the schemes give them a competitive edge in the fight to attract and retain talent
7361330 while regulation improved life expectancy and market volatility have all served to increase pressures on employers sponsoring db pension schemes good scheme design can play a vital role in mitigating their effects

7361333 there are some more general broader rights for which a charter is the more suitable instrument
7361334 for example you have the right to be believed in anything you tell the revenue authorities unless there is evidence that what you are saying is not true the revenue authorities should collect the right amount of tax not necessarily the maximum amount of tax which could be levied you have the right to be represented at a meeting with the revenue authorities by a person of your choice
7361335 when you talk to the policy strategists at hmrc they say the regime is benign and all their staff follow the rules but we find ordinary taxpayers have a very different experience on the ground
7361336 these are hugely draconian proposals that would allow the treasury to unjustly enrich itself at the expense of individual taxpayers the banks have been criticised for their unfair charges but if the banks shouldnt operate in this way why should hmrc
7361337 permitting hmrc to issue daily fines without authorisation from the general or special commissioners would remove a vital legal protection for taxpayers against the arbitrary use of power regardless of whether taxpayers could appeal the balance is shifted firmly in hmrcs favour and would inevitably result in greater use of daily fines
7361338 im here in the hope that people will take care for others the rights that we are fond of enjoying
7361339 for us putting the pressure on democrats is what we feel can do the most good
7361340 theyre the most likely ally to help us but if that pressure is not there we can easily be ignored were trying to put ourselves in a position where our voices are heard
7361341 what were doing at the dnc is highlighting that the democratic party was elected into the majority in 2006 to put pressure on the bush administration and they havent done that
7361342 all of the brutality that american soldiers are trained to treat iraqi civilians with
7361343 we support their right to speak out and are glad these veterans are embracing the opportunity that the convention provides
7361344 but we would hope they would direct the majority of their efforts at the republican party which is responsible for the war in iraq and the policies they seek to change
7361345 i dont think obamas fully committed to ending the war
7361346 i dont really care who the media ties obama to thats his problem not mine
7361347 theres this idea that being a delegate and being a demonstrator are exclusive of each other so were trying to create an environment where you can be against the war and then also be a delegate
7361348 it ties the green sustainability movement to the anti war movement
7361349 all of that was awesome in the 60s but that had its time and place
7361350 i have an issue with the cage that free speech is being quarantined to
7361351 i dont see how delegates are going to be able to see or hear the messaging that the groups have to offer

7361401 i was pleased to sign a piece of legislation that the vfw has long championed a gi bill for the 21st century
7361402 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won this war cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement
7361403 well continue to battle the terrorists overseas so we do not have to face them here at home
7361404 we will ensure that the country never becomes a safe haven again for terrorists who seek to launch attacks on america or our allies
7361405 the vfw understands that the only way to bring them home is with victory
7361406 americas future leaders must remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and thats where our military must stay
7361407 our military will continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgian people
7361408 the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
7361409 the support our troops mentality is disconnected without supporting the cause
7361410 throwing a bumper sticker on a car is not doing us justice
7361411 what will it take for my generation to heed the call as did those americans of the wwii generation
7361412 vfw was one of the first veterans groups to support the memorial

7361430 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7361431 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7361432 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7361433 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7361434 thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7361435 a unified party united in unity together as one undivided
7361436 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
7361437 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7361438 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7361439 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7361440 i knew from the beginning my family would face an impossible situation it wasnt their choice but they have had to carry it with me its difficult for my mother shes crying all day long every time i talk to her shes crying
7361441 but at the same time he sent me a message of love
7361442 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7361443 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7361444 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7361445 this is a planning took where all things are going
7361446 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7361447 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7361448 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7361449 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7361450 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7361451 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7361452 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7361453 das war ein fehler das ging auch nur von dir und deiner merkw rdigen aura aus ich empfinde nichts mehr f r dich ich liebe dich nicht mehr und ich habe keine hoffnung dass das noch mal was wird
7361454 okay ich habe keine ambitionen dein stalker zu werden wenn du meinst sag deiner therapeutin bitte dass ihr beide bl de schweine seid noch zwei nummern d mmer als dieter bohlen planschk he vor dem herrn
7361455 ganz klar ich h tte niemals meine erste ehefrau und unsere kinder verlassen d rfen man darf und soll sich nicht von seiner ersten familie trennen
7361456 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7361457 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7361458 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7361459 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7361460 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7361461 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7361462 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7361463 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7361464 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7361465 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7361466 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7361467 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7361468 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7361469 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7361470 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7361471 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7361472 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7361473 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7361474 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7361475 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7361476 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7361477 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7361478 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7361479 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7361480 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7361481 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7361482 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7361483 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7361484 we can now say with some certainty that calcium is tasted
7361485 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7361486 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7361487 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
7361488 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7361489 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7361490 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7361491 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7361492 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7361493 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7361494 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7361495 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7361496 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7361497 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7361498 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7361499 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7361500 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7361501 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7361502 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7361503 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7361504 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7361505 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7361506 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7361507 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7361508 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7361509 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7361510 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
7361511 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
7361512 despite the macroeconomic conditions we saw improved execution in our merchandising and operations initiatives during the past quarter i am very proud of what our associates have accomplished in a difficult environment
7361513 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7361514 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7361515 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7361516 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7361517 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7361518 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7361519 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7361520 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7361521 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7361522 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7361523 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7361524 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7361525 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7361526 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7361527 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7361528 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7361529 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7361530 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7361531 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7361532 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7361533 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7361534 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7361535 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7361536 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7361537 i want to be a professional golfer but i want to be a student at college as well
7361538 i wasnt really surprised i knew he was going to come back sometime on some holes
7361539 i was expecting that to happen and since he made that chip in i was thinking ive got to play well and keep focused on my game try to make birdies
7361540 koffer e du heim ska itj du p jobb i dag
7361541 no tenemos sitio para jugar ni para estar sin que molestemos los parques aqu est n en un estado de abandono lamentable
7361542 llega en el mejor momento puesto que ya se est empezando a notar en la calle el efecto de la crisis econ mica y entre otras oportunidades el plan nos permitir desarrollar acciones para combatir el desempleo en el municipio
7361543 hay que a adirle las especiales caracter sticas de nuestro sector que aborda desde hace dos a os un exceso desmesurado de viviendas
7361544 la experiencia que yo he vivido es que desde febrero en las palmas ya hab a cuatro cazadores por un piso o local en venta es decir que por cada cuatro inmobiliarias hab a s lo una venta y era evidente que est bamos abocados al cierre
7361545 tiene una mala imagen porque han llegado personas sin formaci n que desconocen la falta de profesionalizaci n del sector
7361546 est n esperando que el vendedor reduzca el precio hasta l mites insospechados para entrar entonces al negocio antes no
7361547 los cr ditos basura que se han concedido a quienes pensaron invertir en la compra de su vivienda la mitad de su sueldo han sido una verdadera ruina para todos porque con la subida del euribor se han plantado en una mensualidad que supone hasta el 70 de su sueldo ellos tienen problemas para pagar la mensualidad y no pueden colaborar en activar la econom a
7361548 en ese periodo los propietarios se han hecho m s receptivos a las ofertas de los compradores y hay descuentos de hasta un 35 del precio que ped an antes de la crisis
7361549 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7361550 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7361551 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7361552 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7361553 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7361554 you come off the field thinking whos injured this week
7361555 having our starting halfback and starting front rower with the injuries theyve got its disappointing after the good comeback we had today
7361556 its one of our options well just have to have a look
7361557 we were down to 19 fit players before today so now were down to 17
7361558 we might look at the nyc under 20s team well pluck someone from somewhere
7361559 whoever has come in this year has played awesome and i suppose whoever replaces thommo and herbie will get the job done too
7361560 we talked about it at halftime we obviously needed to play a lot better football and dig in a bit and we did that
7361561 im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7361562 to come here to a new track we did a fantastic job
7361563 theyll get some further investigation done when they get home and that will determine how theyll be managed from here
7361564 its too early to know but its very likely that theyll be doubtful for brisbane
7361565 obviously well be as thorough as we can in helping rocky through that process and well live with the choices that are made
7361566 it wasnt an easy situation to go into but he certainly relished the opportunity hes been waiting for it hell be much better for it
7361567 the key now is can we back up and therell be many who would suggest we cant
7361568 the history would suggest that also but well get a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7361569 we know that we have to better next week but we want to be better and we want to back up because its something that we havent done
7361570 i think its a reflection on how much they guys gave to secure that victory and then also that our feet hopefully are planted on the ground
7361571 we know that this is a two match tour and were very happy with what we achieved today and rightly so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7361572 economic times are bad people are giving up their pets they are not adopting and not donating to support the facility as a result we have a negative cash flow problem and more animals to care for with less money
7361573 we had a hell of a time on max payne i think hes an actor of unlimited potential and id just love to go around with him again were not in control of these things lots of big people with big checkbooks get to do that if its going to happen then the karma makes it happen
7361574 se gasta mucho dinero tiempo y esfuerzo en repintar escaleras fachadas y muros
7361575 basta con que cierres unos d as tu negocio por vacaciones para que te pinten la fachada y si se trata de un traslado mucho peor
7361576 hay que diferenciar a la persona que pintarrajea una fachada del artista
7361577 quer amos que la gente viera el graffiti como un arte lamentablemente no pudimos seguir organizando la muestra porque no recibimos apoyos ni de la empresa privada ni de las administraciones p blicas
7361578 ill pop out and do a couple of questions on it for you all the other journalists have got this number so you might as well use it
7361579 im going to invite onto the programme everyone who hates me
7361580 i said ill do a deal first half hour you can ask me anything you want and the second half hour i can ask you anything i want he wouldnt do it
7361581 i would question him about his role in the death of dr david kelly i remember hearinghis controversial piece on the today programme it was quite early but my kids had woken up i heard him mention a senior intelligence source and i immediately thought one of the top ten people in mi6 has grassed up the government it turns out to be poor old david kelly basically what gilligan did was what has destroyed so many otherwise good coppers theyve caught a criminal but they havent got the evidence so they falsify the evidence if gilligan hadnt distorted what kelly had said grossly exaggerated it kelly would be alive today
7361582 i told him to his face youve been responsible for one persons death stay away from my family get off my doorstep
7361583 i knew because i was mayor that the met were not investigating this
7361584 and so farewell to happy days theres no more cash for londons gays
7361585 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7361586 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7361587 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate
7361588 the mayor of shanghai is flying me out for a conference in november aboutcity economics im doing the keynote speech about what i think the future is for shanghai and the government of hong kong has got me going out to discuss the environment
7361589 oh yes kens junket to shanghai to have exotic discussions about the growth of international financial centres
7361590 i just think boris is mad not to havegone that opening ceremony i suspect was the most extravagant spectacle in human history it was stunning to watch and im glad i went
7361591 youd got headlines saying suicide bomb backer runs kens campaign followed by kens adviser is linked to terror group which came as news to him the adviser as he had the second highest clearance for mi5 because he is the auditor for the ministry of defence then they said boris was the new messiah people came to the conclusion that it wasnt balanced reporting
7361592 every black person who worked for me was acrook and every asian was a terrorist was the broad theme
7361593 somebody inside the building broke into lee jaspers computer and downloaded eight years of letters and emails
7361594 how are you going to prove it by the time we knew there was no chance of finding anyones fingerprints it had most probably happened weeks if not months before the standard started using it
7361595 i particularly like the londonpaper because they set out to have a paper thats positive about london whereas if the only thing you knew about london was from the evening standard you wouldnt come here for fear of being mugged raped or ripped off its all doom like the daily mail
7361596 lord rothermere came to see me and i told him that i aimed to get the maximum amount for it and that if somebody else bids more than you do theyll get it i suspect a lot of the venom was because of their paranoid fear that i would try and rig the thing the reality is that its no great shakes to me whether its run by rothermere or rupert murdoch neither are going to be particularly progressive i was going to have an auction on the internet for the rights
7361597 we got three times what we expected we got so much more than we expected that we didnt need a bus fare increase this year
7361598 when i first got really interested in politics in the sixties all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the single salient point that was most important in a speech in the paper the next morning
7361599 when the media followed murdoch down the electronic route we were promised that the savings would mean more extensive foreign coverage and everywhere there is less than there was
7361600 there are people who never did anything and im not terribly interested in their opinions i dont want to pick out anybody but catherine bennett of the observer would be a good start why is anyone interested in her opinions has she written great literature produced great art work run a major corporation been elected to office or is she just paid to produce bile
7361601 you might as well pop into the local pub and say whats your opinion its equally valid
7361602 over the last three months the only place you could get really good coverage of city hall was on the blogs
7361603 they havent got off their backsides and logged on to answer all this right wing drivel
7361604 its a 24 7 job if boris had told londoners what he proposed to do which was to appoint tim parker to do the job i was doing whilst he went back to writing his quarter of a million pound column for the telegraph he wouldnt have been elected
7361605 they are planning to target colleges and universities with a new version of the san juan excursions rates and schedules for our whale watching tours wildlife excursions and sea kayaking tours
7361606 we completely understand the case put forward by the local businesses
7361607 such an idea would have to be open to discussion we would never move on it without the consent of all parties
7361608 last year there were massive queues it was taking campers hours to get into town and back
7361609 there were quite a lot of unhappy patrons particularly among the campers this was about ensuring the comfort and safety of patrons and ensuring they didnt drink and drive
7361610 we are conscious of the considerable economic benefit this great event brings to bathurst each year
7361611 however we are also concerned at what appears to be an ever increasing trend of bringing providers particularly in catering and other food and beverage related services from outside bathurst to service the event effectively freezing out local businesses and organisations
7361612 thanks to coles we can work to break down those distance barriers and connect people by delivering cancer information in an immediate setting
7361613 positive feedback and growing support from previous years has seen the event prosper
7361614 it is now considered one of the defining wine shows by industry and wine lovers and has put bathurst on the map as a budding wine region
7361615 the national cool climate wine show has progressively grown over the years showing the tremendous development of australian wines
7361616 he brings things out of you that wouldnt normally tell someone in that type of setting
7361617 you forget youre surrounded by cameras and theres an audience watching we spoke about so much stuff its hard to remember what i said i hope i didnt give too much away
7361618 we came to bathurst from adelaide about 30 years ago to take up a position at mitchell college seeing it through its transition to charles sturt university
7361619 ive since retired from being associate professor in the school of accountancy head of school
7361620 since then its mainly been consulting work with the fairfield division of general practice as chief executive officer upskilling gps projects
7361621 ive been with the molong rural lands protection board for 18 months since the board there was sacked also with a wellington aboriginal housing co operative
7361622 the biggest thing will be for bathurst to come to identify with the show as theirs with support for it from families
7361623 to retain the serious side of the show in agriculture in a rural city show thats a total experience
7361624 im sure show council has taken on board feedback after the last show that it should be a range of things for families from our seniors down ensuring its bigger and better
7361625 there must be something for kids mums dads the whole kit and caboodle from the moment they walk in the gate
7361626 as an academic and a bean counter by training the bottom line has got to be there with a regional show capable of attracting big numbers of the order of 30 000 or more
7361627 im calling for a sustainability and economic development director the two are very linked
7361628 they do a lot of work in schools but its not just about motivating kids i think the kids are motivated they just dont have the power to make changes they need support from the power bases
7361629 its not just an issue of planting more trees its not so simple any more i think an environmental group is too narrow
7361630 it will be my first time visiting bathurst its one excuse to see a little bit more of australia
7361631 travelling around australia for my job is fantastic i love to share my knowledge with australians and vice versa
7361632 i like to work with young australian chefs and obviously a lot of people want to meet chefs from ready steady cook so i like that too
7361633 his campaign is cheapening his greatest strength and making a mockery of his already dubious claim that he s reticent to talk about his pow experience by flashing the pow card to rebut any criticism no matter how unrelated the captivity is already amply displayed in posters and tv advertisements
7361634 did it create a worldview incapable of anticipating the limits to us military power in iraq did he fail to absorb the lessons of vietnam so that he is doomed to always want to refight it did his captivity inform a search and destroy shoot first ask questions later we are all georgians mentality
7361635 they are planning to target colleges and universities with a new version of the san juan excursions rates and schedules for our whale watching tours wildlife excursions and sea kayaking tours
7361636 if he she can lie to her how do i know he she isnt lying to me
7361637 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7361638 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7361639 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7361640 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7361641 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7361642 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7361643 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7361644 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7361645 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7361646 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters
7361647 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7361648 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7361649 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7361650 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7361651 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7361652 as we learn more about the controls of brown fat development medical interventions to increase energy expenditure by brown fat inducing agents such as bmp7 may provide hope to these individuals in losing weight and preventing the metabolic disorders associated with obesity
7361653 brown fat can increase energy expenditure and protect against obesity
7361654 the epidemic of obesity closely associated with increases in diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia cancer and other disorders has propelled a major interest in adipose cells and tissues
7361655 insights into the developmental origin of brown fat cells are of particular interest because of the ability of these cells to burn fat but as is often the case in science new questions follow new insights
7361656 ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
7361657 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and actually doing it
7361658 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7361659 my missus will be upset with me i told her id play well and see her tomorrow its plan b it was not on my schedule to play these two weeks in europe but i came to do a job i didnt do it this week so ill do it next
7361660 they are planning to target colleges and universities with a new version of the kindle
7361661 its from a deleted skit from the 1975 show bettes solo wasnt the only thing left out
7361662 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7361663 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7361664 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7361665 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7361666 the second quarter gdp data will be revised higher because of the trade numbers but the market will be looking more closely at some of the more forward looking data to see what will happen next what is the extent of the economic slowdown going forward
7361667 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7361668 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7361669 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7361670 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7361671 they wont let the economic statement through the senate and now theyre apparently demanding another statement
7361672 its disappointing to have to postpone the tournament but in the end it was a rigorous process that was followed and in the end the security advice around pakistan has just been too tough to overcome
7361673 we wanted to see the process run its course and in the end we didnt have to make a call
7361674 the weight of opinion from around the world meant that it was an obvious choice
7361675 you couldnt hold a good world event in pakistan at the moment the right decision has been made and everyones pretty comfortable with it
7361676 the decision was due to a circumstance in that country that was out of the control of the local cricket board
7361677 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7361678 i havent had a chance to talk to him so i am not going to comment on that
7361679 to advance the tribes strong concerns about the impact of the dams on salmon and steelhead
7361680 the dams on the lower snake and mainstem columbia have a significant impact on the fish and on the nez perce tribe
7361681 we appreciate the action agencies efforts to understand the nez perce tribes unique perspective rights and interests and we will continue to work with these agencies in the many areas where our interests overlap the tribe has simply agreed to disagree with the action agencies on several core issues regarding the impact of the mainstem columbia and lower snake river dams on salmon and steelhead
7361682 ensure that the wild natural runs are rebuilt to healthy harvestable levels and that the conservation burden is fairly shared
7361683 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7361684 we are going to do a drawing for a 2009 family water park pass
7361685 i think the late day fee that we instituted this year which was after 3 00 p m everyone was just 4 seemed to do pretty well
7361686 it seemed to bring some people in and they were glad to have it in addition we had our family night two nights a week on tuesdays and thursdays so tuesdays and thursdays were open until 8 00 p m which is what a lot of people ask for is later hours so i think it went pretty well
7361687 weve seen in the past that the attendance after school starts is really really low
7361688 the cost of maintaining the pool the chemicals the heaters all the electricity outside for one or two more weekends maintaining it all week for the weekends really isnt cost effective
7361689 sunday at the water park is our third annual dog swim from 2 00 to 4 00 p m and dogs are 4 and of course owners are free and any spectators even if you dont have a dog and want to come watch youre welcome to it should be great we are doing a lot of the same things we have done in past years which is swim suit contests tricks contest and doggy paddle races petco will be here as usual with all of their great prizes they bring us a ton of stuff so there will be prizes for all of our contests and its a really fun event
7361690 demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in concentrating energies to accomplish grand feats
7361691 the government has used the olympics to display its organising strength and win over the public with a new kind of self confident nationalism
7361692 perhaps western powers should expect fewer rather than more concessions from china
7361693 the chinese nations olympic dream has always been bound to its course of national revival
7361694 the beijing olympic games have added impetus for national self confidence
7361695 ordinary people will now have a stronger sense that their country really is a rising power
7361696 gold medals dont say everything because chinas sports are state backed but after all to win so many gold medals shouldnt be slighted as a sign of rising prosperity and power
7361697 sports are just sports but this success will intensify foreign fears that china is becoming a successful authoritarian government confident in itself that can chart its own course
7361698 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7361699 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7361700 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7361701 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7361702 on the surface that seems really good but in the long term it could actually drive out independents and that would be lessening competition and in the long term that wouldnt be good for motorists
7361703 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers that what it comes down to
7361704 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7361705 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7361706 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7361707 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7361708 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7361709 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7361710 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7361711 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect

7361726 mccain has been tested like no other politician in america as a prisoner of war he turned down an offer for early release because he refused preferential treatment
7361727 a t many of his mccains events his campaign sets up a screen and plays for the crowd a three minute film called service with honor telling the story of mccains more than five years of captivity in a north vietnamese prison after his navy plane was shot down in 1967 he was offered early release and he told em to shove it says one fellow prisoner of war paul galanti
7361728 when i was allowed the opportunity given the opportunity to return home early from prison camp i decided against that because i knew the effect that it would have on my fellow prisoners
7361729 when i was in prison in vietnam i like other of my fellow pows was offered early release by my captors most of us refused because we were bound to our code of conduct which said those who had been captured the earliest had to be released the soonest
7361730 john mccain shot down bayoneted tortured offered early release he said no hed sworn an oath
7361731 t he vietnamese came to me and said well allow you to go home early because my father happened to be a high ranking admiral our code of conduct said that only those go home early in order of capture it was a brave young mexican american by the name of everett alvarez who had been in prison a couple years longer than i had so i knew i had to refuse
7361732 one time when i was in prison in north vietnam and the north vietnamese came and said you can go home early because my father was a high ranking admiral i chose not to do that
7361733 with nine men and to restrict burnley like that and the effort they gave me
7361734 i think that is just what we needed to kick start the season the fans got behind us and it was fantastic really i know we havent got a goal but i will sort that
7361735 there are a lot of plusses after the game i couldnt ask more of anybody i think they epitomised everything about the club we tried our hardest we have limited funds compared to what other clubs have got but we will always give it a go
7361736 i was disappointed with the scowcroft decision not the first booking but derry was a cert two yellow cards and you cant complain about that
7361737 i thought he got it wrong with the scowcroft incident i felt that both of them were doing that when you look at it on the videos i couldnt see one without the other
7361738 oh yeah of course he has apologised he is captain and he has let us all down
7361739 i told him that if he didnt want to go to leeds for their carling cup tie he didnt have to do that i think i might take him with us just for punishment
7361740 i have to say i thought it was a perfectly good goal we had chalked off and i just felt given the territorial advantage that we could have picked a better final pass the application and effort was there and i just feel we never really showed that real quality in the final third
7361741 if anyone had offered us a point beforehand we would have taken it but given the circumstances of the day we are disappointed not to get three points
7361742 in the first half it was a bit nervous especially having lost the first two games
7361743 nos sorprendi la cantidad y el hecho de que esta persona haya mencionado que desde hace 15 a os realizaba esta labor que a su saber y entender es un trabajo propio de un reciclador
7361744 by the law of periodical repetition everything which has happened once must happen again and again and again and not capriciously but at regular periods and each thing in its own period not anothers and each obeying its own law the same nature which delights in periodical repetition in the sky is the nature which orders the affairs of the earth let us not underrate the value of that hint
7361745 what the indices all have in common is that they are getting overbought and may be in need of a correction the poor quality of breadth and the relatively low volume in this rally are proof of the underlying lack of demand for stocks next week will be critical in determining the course of the short term trend if we cannot extend the move which started on friday morning the market is at risk of making a reversal which will lead to additional consolidation and perhaps new lows in the weakest indices over the next few weeks
7361746 the move down from 1440 still has an unfilled projection to 1180 or below the rally from 1201 barely reached a 382 retracement on friday it may not go much higher without additional consolidation a 50 normal retracement would take it to 1320 anything less has to be considered weak
7361747 this favors a little more selling tomorrow morning to the target zone before we reverse 1262 would be ideal
7361748 bull or bear call it what you will the fate of precious metals seems to rest with the u s and european economies and the extent to which the monetary base will have to be inflated to prevent a deflationary spiral the rally off the july 15 lows in stocks has shown the market tends to overreact in these situations and in this case the cause for the selloff is rather tenuous at best and based on some uncertain assumptions
7361749 the strangest thing just happened to me i called you a minute ago but some strange asian lady was talking all confused instead of you

7361790 after he had been repeatedly hit by the mob ademolu slumped and could not be revived he was subsequently rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead
7361791 akinwale the marketing officer however survived but with several wounds on him following severe beatings he equally received from the mob he too was taken to the hospital and promptly admitted
7361792 akinwale approached a fish farm which was disconnected the previous day monday august 18 for direct connection non payment of connection fee and stealing of electricity and found the fish farm illegally reconnected through a neighbours network the unregistered customer has become notorious for these illegal reconnections
7361793 in the process of asking and admonishing the fish farms neighbour who facilitated the illegal reconnection the owner of the fish farm one of the four suspects arrested by the police for the murder came out of the farm wielding a machete and threatened to kill akinwale if he did not leave the neighbourhood immediately
7361794 as akinwale made to leave the suspects and his boys pounced on him beating him mercilessly akinwale was able to call the manager marketing ademolu to come and intervene

7361808 through aggressive management of xdr tb cases including by ensuring that patients are correctly diagnosed as early as possible and put on appropriate treatment for the correct length of time it may be possible to slow the rise of xdr tb deaths around the world and reduce further transmission of the most drug resistant strains of tb

7361811 scottish badgers is very concerned about the misuse of snares in the countryside
7361812 in some circumstances snaring might be the least inhumane method where control is necessary
7361813 anyone with evidence of such practice should report it to their local police wildlife crime officer
7361814 the scottish government is in the process of tightening legislation on snaring
7361815 this will introduce a number of provisions aimed at substantially reducing the number of non target animals such as badgers caught in snares

7361847 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7361848 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7361849 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7361850 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7361851 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7361852 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7361853 it is no surprise that they would use karl rove style tactics to distort obamas record and try to scare voters
7361854 when gun owners get past the fear tactics and realize they have nothing to fear from barack obama they quickly understand that obama is the candidate who will preserve the hunting and fishing traditions of montana by protecting and expanding access to public lands
7361855 i can see eventually 60 acres being developed the equivalent of an entire downtown
7361856 successful downtowns have a number of attractions which include residential retail and entertainment developments
7361857 hotel restaurants retail outlets apartment towers and senior citizen residences
7361858 of this signifiant initiative during a special downtown strategic planning meeting of council on june 23 more than a month after the brook mcilroy consultants were hired
7361859 the proposed downtown marina and canal now the subject of a feasibility study to which he contributed 25 000 is
7361860 this is the most interesting plan ive seen in any community in this country
7361861 the entire lauzon road corridor is going to come to life again this just adds to and complements the activity at the wfcu centre shrewd investors are already picking up properties
7361862 i can see eventually 60 acres being developed the equivalent of an entire downtown
7361863 if someone were to indicate an interest in buying a piece of that 60 acres farhi said he would consider it
7361864 as for the feared traffic bottlenecks this winter during spitfire games at the wfcu centre farhi said that wont happen
7361865 as for economic spin offs from the new wfcu centre lescanec said anything which creates activity is beneficial
7361866 any time you can get 4 000 or 5 000 people to come down to an event that has to help
7361867 of course the colosseum has been a major change as well and theres clearly been a spike in attendance with the influx of 5 000 people on concert nights
7361868 i would say the majority are u s visitors but there has been an increase in our canadian clientele as well
7361869 it just makes me so angry that were missing such a huge opportunity if you want to revitalize your downtown you build things downtown
7361870 what marketing studies have been done wheres the business plan to show us this is even viable show us the goods
7361871 it would complement the great work the city has done
7361872 i see mixed use commercial anything and everything we can build there we can do whatever i have to see what we can place next to it the arena if someone were to indicate an interest in buying a piece of that 60 acres farhi said he would consider it

7361877 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this

7361962 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing

7361965 when they scored against him i had set attacking fields to capture an extra wicket any other day he would have bowled with a different field so things would have been different he is a quality spinner and will bounce back
7361966 theres no other way to explain because even the doctors are amazed at how well i have healed
7361967 im on workmans comp right now of course im still getting a paycheck from the city but officers work a lot of extra jobs and unfortunately im one of those that work a lot of extra jobs
7361968 he cant work his second job and his wife had to take some time off also so this will help with the expenses
7361969 im still having some issues with my shoulder and thats the shoulder that actually runs the gas and you just cant lay it down on your lap because you cant go nowhere
7361970 but im hoping to be back on it here pretty soon
7361971 when you get a lot of people out here thats good therapy because your mind is off of what happened
7361972 im ahead of schedule according to the doctors all the prayers and everything have evidently helped me along quite well
7361973 theres days especially with the recent incidents at central high school and the unitarian church and all that it kind of brings things back

7361978 all i can say is that weve taken steps to put drinking water in place which should have been done years ago
7361979 i would say there probably are some people drinking it if they are i hope theyre looking after their health
7361980 weve always struggled with water but its never been as bad as this
7361981 weve been promised by the premier that cloncurry is not going to run out of water
7361982 margaret told me she was very concerned for kens safety

7361986 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7361987 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7361988 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7361989 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7361990 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector

7362001 john mccain was a cheerleader for the war in iraq right after 9 11 he was ready to go right in
7362002 i think he was wrong and i was right and russ feingold was right that this is the wrong approach that we need to finish the job in afghanistan that we dont want to fan the flames of anti american sentiment im happy to compare his judgment to mine

7362014 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7362015 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7362016 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7362017 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7362018 they wont let the economic statement through the senate and now theyre apparently demanding another statement
7362019 se tiene que buscar un punto de equilibrio entre el estado y las comunidades nativas y campesinas
7362020 desde de la perspectiva del estado los recursos naturales son patrimonio de la naci n es decir de todos pero desde el punto de vista hist rico hay derechos ancestrales de las poblaciones ind genas se tiene que buscar un punto de equilibrio hay que pensar en el conjunto del pa s sin dejar de lado las necesidades de las comunidades

7362026 the position is i have not rendered a fee note to the solicitor for the work done and that solicitor has not rendered a bill to winston
7362027 until my instructing solicitor renders a bill to winston there is no debt owed by winston
7362028 the obligation to meet any outstanding fee was understood as a moral not a legal obligation if the money cannot be fundraised then my time is donated
7362029 i would where possible fundraise and any funds raised would go towards the fees due
7362030 this procedure means winston at no time had a legal obligation to pay me any fees the fees are either a donation of my time or fundraised

7362040 by changing the company sick pay scheme rules we will change the sickness absence culture automatically

7362120 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
7362121 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
7362122 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
7362123 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
7362124 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
7362125 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
7362126 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
7362127 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
7362128 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
7362129 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
7362130 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same

7362154 national candidates tend to be more savvy and lock up their domain names early
7362155 savvy forward thinking public figures generally have gotten ahead of this and own web sites associated with their public person they either bought it early before they were famous or later negotiated to buy it
7362156 i was contacted by someone representing the kerry campaign the day after they announced edwards was going to join the ticket they asked me if i was interested in loaning or donating the domain to the campaign i told them no and that i had been offered 10 000 for the domain already which i had the conversation ended and i never heard from them again
7362157 websites are important vehicles to provide information to constituents and to boost participation in the political process
7362158 in the wrong hands a web address can be used to mislead and misrepresent a public officials record that is why i am extremely grateful that pool com allowed me the opportunity to renew my domain and ensure that the information on the page reflects my values and beliefs
7362159 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why

7362161 when there arent identifiable pieces sometimes we dont know right away what was working and what wasnt working
7362162 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7362163 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7362164 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7362165 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7362166 lapertura della festa un atto ufficiale solenne che questanno assume un valore simbolico ancora pi alto dato che la prima festa del nuovo partito sar la prima volta che i militanti che vengono da diversi partiti e diverse culture potranno mescolarsi e misurarsi per limpresa comune rappresentata dal partito e dalla festa sar una festa di intrattenimento di dialogo di confronto ma sar soprattutto una festa di proposta di combattimento

7362182 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7362183 i had two weeks to try to impress nick and the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7362184 players go through physical fitness issues good or bad and in this case its psychological and weve just go to deal with it
7362185 ill pop out and do a couple of questions on it for you all the other journalists have got this number so you might as well use it
7362186 im going to invite onto the programme everyone who hates me
7362187 i said ill do a deal first half hour you can ask me anything you want and the second half hour i can ask you anything i want he wouldnt do it
7362188 i would question him about his role in the death of dr david kelly i remember hearinghis controversial piece on the today programme it was quite early but my kids had woken up i heard him mention a senior intelligence source and i immediately thought one of the top ten people in mi6 has grassed up the government it turns out to be poor old david kelly basically what gilligan did was what has destroyed so many otherwise good coppers theyve caught a criminal but they havent got the evidence so they falsify the evidence if gilligan hadnt distorted what kelly had said grossly exaggerated it kelly would be alive today
7362189 i told him to his face youve been responsible for one persons death stay away from my family get off my doorstep
7362190 i knew because i was mayor that the met were not investigating this
7362191 and so farewell to happy days theres no more cash for londons gays
7362192 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7362193 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7362194 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate
7362195 the mayor of shanghai is flying me out for a conference in november aboutcity economics im doing the keynote speech about what i think the future is for shanghai and the government of hong kong has got me going out to discuss the environment
7362196 oh yes kens junket to shanghai to have exotic discussions about the growth of international financial centres
7362197 i just think boris is mad not to havegone that opening ceremony i suspect was the most extravagant spectacle in human history it was stunning to watch and im glad i went
7362198 youd got headlines saying suicide bomb backer runs kens campaign followed by kens adviser is linked to terror group which came as news to him the adviser as he had the second highest clearance for mi5 because he is the auditor for the ministry of defence then they said boris was the new messiah people came to the conclusion that it wasnt balanced reporting
7362199 every black person who worked for me was acrook and every asian was a terrorist was the broad theme
7362200 somebody inside the building broke into lee jaspers computer and downloaded eight years of letters and emails
7362201 how are you going to prove it by the time we knew there was no chance of finding anyones fingerprints it had most probably happened weeks if not months before the standard started using it
7362202 i particularly like the londonpaper because they set out to have a paper thats positive about london whereas if the only thing you knew about london was from the evening standard you wouldnt come here for fear of being mugged raped or ripped off its all doom like the daily mail
7362203 lord rothermere came to see me and i told him that i aimed to get the maximum amount for it and that if somebody else bids more than you do theyll get it i suspect a lot of the venom was because of their paranoid fear that i would try and rig the thing the reality is that its no great shakes to me whether its run by rothermere or rupert murdoch neither are going to be particularly progressive i was going to have an auction on the internet for the rights
7362204 we got three times what we expected we got so much more than we expected that we didnt need a bus fare increase this year
7362205 when i first got really interested in politics in the sixties all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the single salient point that was most important in a speech in the paper the next morning
7362206 when the media followed murdoch down the electronic route we were promised that the savings would mean more extensive foreign coverage and everywhere there is less than there was
7362207 there are people who never did anything and im not terribly interested in their opinions i dont want to pick out anybody but catherine bennett of the observer would be a good start why is anyone interested in her opinions has she written great literature produced great art work run a major corporation been elected to office or is she just paid to produce bile
7362208 you might as well pop into the local pub and say whats your opinion its equally valid
7362209 over the last three months the only place you could get really good coverage of city hall was on the blogs
7362210 they havent got off their backsides and logged on to answer all this right wing drivel
7362211 its a 24 7 job if boris had told londoners what he proposed to do which was to appoint tim parker to do the job i was doing whilst he went back to writing his quarter of a million pound column for the telegraph he wouldnt have been elected
7362212 it signalled a degree of return to normality and recovery that everyone here understood immediately we had stopped reviewing restaurants critically since hurricane katrina because we felt it was impossible for the restaurants with their staff shortages and limited facilities to achieve the standards our critic would apply now we have decided that the restaurant scene is robust enough to withstand critiquing the new york times wrote a piece about it which shows they understood how much a bread and butter issue like that means to the city
7362213 many houses slowly rot still bearing on their walls the painted marks left by the us military to show whether corpses were inside
7362214 i dont think we are on peoples minds we have to contend with those voices particularly on pop radio which say new orleanians with their eternal whining why dont they pull themselves up by their boot straps it cuts both ways we are regarded with distrust because we do these strange things like mardi gras and we have far too much fun which seems un american and that produces resentment there is also a deep well of affection for the place as we see from the volunteers who have come here in their thousands to help the rebuilding
7362215 katrina is and will be a defining moment of our lives a story well be telling till the day we die
7362216 i wondered a year and a half ago whether there would ever come a time when the word hurricane or katrina would not appear on or near page one
7362217 the two themes we heard were be patient and do not expect too much for several years and the other was dont expect government to be the generator of your recovery because you will be disappointed
7362218 thats been true of the federal government which although it did provide quite a bit of funds was deplorable in getting them to the people and it was right about the amount of volunteerism which one would normally discount as nice but insufficient but has proved tremendous
7362219 we have not so much changed in the degree of our localness but the paper has changed in intensity and relevance because so much was at stake the very survival of the community was hanging in the balance
7362220 before katrina there were colleagues in the newsroom who were sceptical of the value of the internet but then even the most dinosaurish realised this was the only way to reach scattered readers it changed our owners view of the website too because suddenly we went from 700 000 page views to 30 million over night it was a sea change for us
7362221 everything happens on a micro scale of thousands of little decisions with each one having a thousand little ingredients can i afford it what is my insurance going to be can i find a contractor to help me will i be all alone in a block without neighbours
7362222 disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7362223 its just finished its eighth year ive had people say that its the longest running single presented programme in terms of hours on tv
7362224 the shows unique selling point is that its a public access tv show tv execs id met from other channels didnt have the bottle to give the public the chance to give theirviews unhindered with no delay
7362225 it has demonstrated that the great british public is far from being a bunch of dimwits who have to be told how to decorate christmas trees as is the case on many daytime shows they are actually articulate andpassionate about a wide range of issues from high politics to dumb low pop culture
7362226 its absolutely crucial one of the things i pride myself on is that because we can turn things round very quickly we dont have a huge budget to spend on special effects and sending reporters to do ludicrous and unnecessary live broadcasts we can get discussions on air 24 hours before the bbc with all their resources
7362227 we are disproportionately abc1 we also have a surprisingly high male audience even though we actively court women when i address the audience we nearly always refer to you ladies you girls you women and never talk directly to fellas yet the audience is almost 50 50
7362228 i think hes benefited enormously because he doesnt appear to be totally on message he does things which the blue rinse brigade might find shocking such as taking herbal viagra live on the show
7362229 my fridays were nudging 21 hours in duration i was also doing prerecorded interviews during the week and i just cant keep up that kind of schedule and do all the other work as well it had to go and im absolutely gutted about it as is radio 2 controller lesley douglas i believe
7362230 im hoping that its not the end ofmy relationship with radio 2 just a bit of scaling down at the moment
7362231 the wright stuff is to all intents and purposes a phone in show on television theres a natural link between that and radio work im an arts graduate i did a drama degree and my interests are ballet drama and rock nroll the weekender gave me an opportunity to show a bit of my knowledge and it was a show im extremely proud of
7362232 the motorbikes are all quite slow im a chugger not a racer my best friend was killed when i was 21 and that killed off the race element for me
7362233 the whip round editor richard wallace organised for me was vouchers for a fly fishing shop so i bought all the kit and set about learning it from a book i jokingly say to people that it saved my life because when my marriage hit the rocks i had something else to focus on it has changed my life i just love the nature the beauty
7362234 i have never been part of that journalism clique because i was a child actor and in my heart of hearts i have always wanted to do the entertainment
7362235 although tv is just as intense the intensity isnt as prolonged it also comes more naturally to me i dont want to say the word easy but i dont find it stressful i find it enjoyable
7362236 if you think im working hard think of what piers is doing now he has a tv career on both sides of the atlantic he writes newspaper and magazine columns goes to every showbiz party going and writes best selling books but hes bored all the time because hes so used toworking at this manic rate he never used to get stressed out by the mania
7362237 now that they have put the great back into britain
7362238 can we all remember just how fantastic this country and its people are
7362239 lets wrap ourselves in the flag not only for the homecoming parade on 16 october but every day
7362240 a senior cabinet minister told colleagues yesterday to avoid the impression of jostling to succeed gordon brown
7362241 an inquest is an important public occasion the power to ban reporters from inquests could be used in all sorts of cases to halt the reporting of embarrassing stories for the government or the armed forces
7362242 there are already procedures in place to hold hearings in camera appointing someone who will be seen as a government stooge is no way of ensuring that the justice system is free and fair
7362243 respecting freedoms for our press the removal of barriers to investigative journalism respecting the public right to know
7362244 served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest
7362245 to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest
7362246 disclosures of information are penalised even where they are not harmful to national security
7362247 appeared in a photospread in gq wearing a pair of red knickers and a teeny tiny vest
7362248 it all went pretty much to plan he got a lead and came and took it up late just right weve always thought a lot of the horse but where he goes next will have to fit in with the owners plans for the rest of theirs
7362249 hes got plenty of speed and is bred for quick conditions but the ground didnt stop him
7362250 its a wonder cornbury the big chill and the rest havent cancelled out of sheer embarrassment
7362251 i saw the big chill had put in their programme that the festival song was deadly accurate but they took it in good spirit
7362252 it was written about people like us and our friends who are over the idea of going to a festival and getting filthy the idea of going in relative comfort to a nice boutique festival where no one gets too dirty and your tent doesnt get stolen and no one gets beaten up gets more attractive the older you get
7362253 apart from not actually getting commissioned i was very happy about all of it
7362254 id sort of been doing the contents of the show for a couple of years and putting them on the internet so i was pretty happy that it all sort of worked but from bbc 3s point of view it wasnt the kind of show that they are making there anymore and it just didnt feel right for them
7362255 its fantastic though i havent quite worked out what my position is to being over there
7362256 ricky gervais always goes on about how brilliant it is i bumped into russell brand this week at heathrow and when he went to buy something the place was buzzing kids looked like theyd met father christmas it was like hed sprinkled celebrity dust in his wake
7362257 if you are like jesus christ you know weve got a chance here you cant drop the ball dont mess up know what i mean this is your big break now its no good
7362258 and weve had so many big breaks that have come and gone now weve relaxed in a much more enjoyable way
7362259 you really see it with a stand up comedian i always remember watching stewart lee when he was young and very vain and he had his hair teased over his head and i enjoyed it much less than i do now where he clearly doesnt care less if a stand up comedian is nervous and uptight it infects the whole crowd immediately and you can hear that on the radio as well
7362260 im not sure theres much further we could go really than doing this
7362261 possibly go to a bigger radio station with a bigger audience were never going to be like jo wiley and zane lowe wed just say something terrible its hard enough doing it just once a week its a full time job to just do that one thing and really nail it
7362262 i think to be a really successful presenter you have to know how to lie well or to do what your bosses tell you to do to promote the other shows on the station it is dangerous not to do that and stupid and bad for your career we go out of our way not to so you try and be honest about stuff and then you open up a huge yawning chasm of doom
7362263 any minute now i expect the cold hand of reality to grab me by the scruff of the neck march me down to the basement car park and slam my nuts repeatedly in the glove compartment of the company jag
7362264 i never realised you could spend a million bucks in k mart
7362265 rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 theres nothing else theres nothing else and i mean this sincerely hes genuinely not qualified to be president
7362266 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7362267 a president in a parliamentary system should be someone above day to day politics with him controversies will continue around the presidency
7362268 politicians need to realise that with each day that passes people who face bomb blasts crippling inflation and a general sense of despair grow more distant from their government
7362269 part of continuing protests against indias rule in kashmir it was time to demand our right to self determination through a referendum
7362270 he may be my father but he will never be my dad
7362271 the situation i was in and the pressure i was under was enormous
7362272 if you have a family like mine a large tribe they all want to impose their opinion on you i am the eldest son so it was very difficult for me to do what i wanted to do father mother and brothers come first for us and we experienced a lot of difficulties in iraq over the years wars we had to move house and i was without work for a while
7362273 but these are excuses and children do not do excuses
7362274 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for somali people
7362275 the democratic national convention committee announced today that the delaware delegation would move to the front of the pepsi centre
7362276 its clear that china has put the bar very high and its going to be a challenge for london and also for all the subsequent games
7362277 but i believe london has unique assets london is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport that has invented the rules of the sports and the values of fair play it is a cosmopolitan multi ethnic and multi religious city and thats something they can build on for the rest i have no concerns the venues will be fine the village will be fine the organisation will be fine
7362278 i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home athletics is coming home sport is coming home
7362279 the british team is ready and thats important because we want a powerful and successful home team to foster the enthusiasm of the whole population that has been achieved four years beforehand and they will be able to improve even on that
7362280 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7362281 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport some of the changes in china are obvious today others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7362282 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7362283 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7362284 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7362285 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7362286 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7362287 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7362288 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope

7362293 we strongly suspect that the missing are on the lower reaches of the glacier underneath the lumps of serac pillar of ice which means we cant really do anything
7362294 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7362295 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7362296 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7362297 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7362298 i wasnt completely submerged i was able to help the others

7362303 we cant sit back and say were the top european nation theres still a lot of hard work to do to ensure were competitive again in 2012
7362304 after the world championships in palma in 2007 people asked how we could go out and win more medals but thats exactly what we did in the worlds at manchester this year
7362305 then people said wed peaked too early and wondered how we would be able to step up again at the olympics
7362306 weve got plans that weve put in place for london but its going to be a really hard task to catch the brits in four years lets not kid ourselves

7362313 almost half of hillary clintons voters at this moment in time say they are not prepared to vote for barack obama
7362314 thats almost half right there who arent ready to commit to obama theres frustration theres anger among a considerable chunk of hillary clinton supporters
7362315 o ur poll shows that only three in 10 arent for him
7362316 are still mad youve got this wall street journal poll that shows only 52 percent now support obama

7362319 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7362320 dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead i had to keep giving her the sad news over and over again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7362321 it was pretty obvious when i last saw her in november 2005 that she was pretty off the map so to speak but like with reagan people give former heads of state some dignity because of the stigma attached
7362322 we know she has had small strokes and these lead to memory loss you can still have a conversation with her about contemporary politics dementia is a very emotive word which conjures up a very particular image in conversation thatcher may need a bit of occasional reminding but then so do we all

7362330 a combination of british energy and centrica solves the problems facing both companies today together they can work out a joint venture with edf to build nuclear sites
7362331 a possible merger of centrica with british energy if terms could be agreed and all parties are fully supportive
7362332 instead of people gathering to develop a culture they want to escape from other people individuals believe they can reach a level of self sufficiency that can isolate them or their family in an ideal place then they somehow expect the civilisation that has made them to serve them its a parasitic kind of life
7362333 it was not a community for communitys sake eating tofu and giving each other back rubs

7362340 our rating for eland house tells us we must clearly do better to make a difference to our energy performance
7362341 we are now acting on recommendations from our advisory report to help us improve future ratings
7362342 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production

7362355 si analizamos las actuaciones de los pa ses de la regi n no es la mejor mientras que los chinos realizaron marcas impresionantes hasta los momentos no se recibi alguna queja por parte de los atletas sobre su plan de preparaci n pero hay que modificar muchas cosas

7362503 we are getting information that they are still in captivity but their whereabouts are unknown
7362504 he emailed on friday night and said he took some fantastic photos
7362505 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu
7362506 they are nowhere to be found they were to visit parts of lower shabelle region

7362510 he made a couple of calls to me and was very interested in having me come here the organization was first class in terms of how they dealt with everything
7362511 hes a guy that sees the ice well and hes very talented and composed for a young kid
7362512 i only spent two or three days with joel at that time
7362513 they were playing the exhibition schedule but i didnt come over until later today hes very well respected around the league he demands a lot hes from the old school and hes a good coach
7362514 playing against the avalanche for many years i was well aware of the respect they earned around the league the history that theyve made with their stanley cup victories really speaks for itself

7362523 prostitution related offences have always been very low priority that calls into question why we do this in the first place if theyre such low priority
7362524 unless the police are receiving complaints from the community theyre not going to act
7362525 there are too many deaths too many robberies too many rapes too many beatings which are a direct result of the law
7362526 that would be one significant factor why the numbers are down
7362527 there isnt that element that we say if its not bothering anyone we leave it alone
7362528 sex trade workers tend to recruit younger and younger individuals
7362529 were certainly on the fact that we could be dealing with children under 18 years of age out on the street
7362530 when youre on the street youre a nobody nobody cares about you
7362531 if you should be beaten up or robbed or raped and you go to the police its rather dicey whether they lay charges against the person or whether they think youre credible they may even end up charging you
7362532 we felt given the new information on saturday we had to take the most conservative approach possible the most conservative approach that we could think of and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7362533 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7362534 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7362535 theres a large relatively meaningful percentage of the population that walk around as carriers of listeria it exists in our environment in your environment
7362536 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7362537 we heard a lot of different stories about how intense and in your face he was so we were ready for that
7362538 but the truth is hes very respectful toward us even when we get some criticism hes a smart guy who just wants to make guys better
7362539 when you play with a guy like mike knuble for a couple of years and then add daniel briere in the middle its not too hard to adjust
7362540 looking back to training camp the first four games were not the way we wanted
7362541 but after that it started coming every game it feels like its getting better and better
7362542 i faced a lot of pressure last year when the judge awarded me a 5 million contract in arbitration and im taking the same approach as i did last year
7362543 im a competitor and i want to prove to people that i deserve the contract at the same time youve just got to keep playing your game you dont want to change
7362544 i think all three games were pretty much a playoff atmosphere
7362545 obviously sidneys a world class player probably the best player in the world hes 20 years old imagine the pressure and the tight checking on him and he still manages to be good every night
7362546 this is a young group these are big games tough games to play theyre learning quickly with all the attention theyre getting when we went to edmonton and calgary they were waiting for us both teams were ready to take us on and the same with the canucks we have to perform game after game
7362547 i dont think ive really changed a whole lot with the way i play i probably try to control my emotions a little bit more i dont think im going to change too much competing is a big part of what allows you to have success and i dont think im going to stop competing
7362548 i know its an opportunity and ive been working to take advantage of it
7362549 half the guys on the team werent even part of what happened last year once the off season set in we put what happened behind us its early and theres still lots of reason to be optimistic about this years team
7362550 but at the same time you give up some experience as a young guy i remember thinking at times why am i not playing as much as im used to its hard to understand but i think as you get older and especially after the run we made to the stanley cup finals you realize just how important experience is its reflected in the little plays and often those little plays are what result in games being won nonetheless all these young guys have come in and played great theyve brought a lot of energy to our locker room theyre good kids and they work hard
7362551 sure you want to lead by example and say the right things but you also have to count on your teammates to go out there and do the right things in this locker room were going to live and die by four lines
7362552 i worked hard in the summer and im looking forward to the rest of the season
7362553 weve played together predominantly for the last two years and were pretty comfortable with each other if you get him the puck you just get open and hes going to find you
7362554 i remember going out there with my dad and he wouldnt give me a stick for the first couple of years he just wanted me to learn how to skate because he knew that was the most important part of the game those are pretty fun memories
7362555 shawn horcoff was in my class and i always thought he was such a well behaved boy
7362556 he excelled in all sports but he never flaunted his superiority nor did he ridicule the less able athletes
7362557 every kid growing up in canada wants to make the nhl and their first thoughts in western canada at least are toward playing in the whl because its the quickest route but my parents had the foresight to tell me that being patient and going the educational route would pay dividends
7362558 those were the four best years of my life i really credit becoming an all around player to going to michigan state and playing for coach mason he put the most college players into the nhl that had a big influence on my choice of michigan state he always used to tell us he knew what it took to put players into the nhl and we just had to listen to him at the end of the day he was probably right
7362559 a little bit i guess in my junior year but not too much i realized that i was in no rush to turn pro and then go straight to the minors i knew that the college game was a good game there was still a lot for me to learn going back for my senior year was definitely the right decision
7362560 my wife cindy is from northville there at michigan state
7362561 we have tons of friends and family in the area now that weve got a couple of young kids we needed a home base and it was pretty much a no brainer for us to go back there
7362562 i think my ability to adapt is what kept me in the nhl early on
7362563 you know i played wing for a full year i look back now and if i wasnt able to do that it would have been a lot harder on me i would have had to stick it out in the minors you realize eventually that not too many players come in and step into an offensive role right away youve got to pay your dues and thats what i did ive played pretty much every line and every position you can from fourth line wing to first line center because of it i feel like im a pretty well rounded player that can play in any situation
7362564 youre going up against some of the best players in the world when you play well on a stage like that you cant help but start to believe in yourself and your abilities it was a turning point in my career i wanted to step up and become more of an offensive player and it gave me a chance to do that
7362565 after last season i was heading back through detroit those guys know i live around there in the off season well we were obviously out of the playoffs and the wings were just starting their playoff run they both gave me a call and asked if i could take over their pa jobs a little bit during the playoffs obviously i said id oblige i had no problem with that from there it just went further and further its been a great experience
7362566 i dont think there were any questions in our locker room about who was going to be the captain
7362567 the guys been here the longest out of all of us now that jason smith has left him being named captain it was deservedly so hes a guy whos got great leadership skills and his work ethics impeccable hes a force out there in the game i think hes the best choice by far for us
7362568 its going to be about staying positive we know we have a relatively inexperienced team and therell be lots of ups and downs we learned last year that it can be a roller coaster the more even keeled you can stay the better chance youll have to be successful
7362569 and until we do were not going to get out of this win one lose one scenario we need to make sure that when teams play us they know what theyre in for right now even we dont know with the inconsistent play were coming out with weve talked about it in meeting after meeting amongst ourselves before games between periods and so on weve got to take a look in the mirror and make sure were prepared to go to battle every single night
7362570 if youve got to win a game 1 0 then thats what you do
7362571 we dont have the same scoring prowess we had last year weve got to grind to wear other teams down impose our will on them and score goals playing physical and creating turnovers and all those little things we do well when were playing our style of hockey
7362572 when we kill penalties right now were not getting the breaks
7362573 when the pucks hitting somebody or hitting a stick it seems to go right to an opposing player anyway weve obviously got to work a lot harder at killing penalties if were going to take that many
7362574 we need everybody to raise the level of their game by 10 or 15 percent and thats what were asking
7362575 i think that tonight and last night were an indication of how much work we have ahead of us even with scott niedermayer
7362576 i feel a little bit better for sure this is a tough game physically but hopefully the training camp parts over for me
7362577 i think the ducks were playing well before he came back to the lineup but adding him has given them that extra boost

7362582 lyel lyel ascolta da qui non ce modo di fuggire ma posso inidicarti come comunicare con kal
7362583 dimmi sar ben lieta di poterlo raggiungere anche solo con la voce
7362584 ecco posso farti un dono grande ma star al tuo cuore permettere al dono di potersi materializzare
7362585 se tu amassi kal sarebbe pi semplice ma per ora non ce tale sentimento da unirvi
7362586 aspetta che intendi dire che un giorno io e lui no dai non scherzare li voglio bene ma no
7362587 questo non sta a me dirtelo sar il tempo a risponderti con segni che vivrai e sentirai nel cuore
7362588 non posso svelarti pi di quanto gi non tabbia detto comunque tornando al dono ecco ti dono la mia armatura dellangelo della luce molto simile a quella di kal ma con una particolarit indistruttibile essa pu permetterti una volta indossata di apparire in qualsiasi luogo tu voglia anche di materializzarti e mutare il tuo aspetto ma attenta per usarla ci vuole un cuore puro e predisposto allamore
7362589 e tu decidi di affidare la vita di kal a me perch proprio io
7362590 perch tu sei colei che stata scielta per via del tuo cuore cos luminoso e pronto a donarsi tu ami gi kal ma ancora non sai quanto e in che misura ed il tuo volergli bene ti ha legato a lui per questo solo tu puoi aiutarlo ora a ritrovare la strada ed il desiderio di rifarsi avvolgere dalla luce
7362591 ma ci assurdo come fai a dire certe cose dai kal ed io apparteniamo a 2 mondi diversi lui per me pu essere un fratello o un amico nulla di pi
7362592 sai ci buffo perch son le stesse cose che sostiene kal dimenticando che per ogni creatura di dio ce una gemella che lo completa e lo render ancora pi speciale ed unico
7362593 sei sicura di ci che dici se cos fosse non potrei sciegliere io chi amare e donare il mio cuore
7362594 no in questo sbagli sei libera anche di rifiutare ma cos negheresti la vera felicit che il padre celeste vuole donarti per avere una vita piena e soddisfacente comunque sei libera di sciegliere come pi desidererai ma ricorda le scielte che facciamo ricadono anche sugli altri nessuno vive fine a se stesso

7362642 to the industrial revolution what cathedrals were to the medieval world
7362643 one tower went down perfectly the second only came down partially a third of it was left standing not exactly what we hoped for there were rumours they hit the motorway but when the dust cleared the highways agency said there was absolutely no debris on the nearby m1 motorway one of our teams chipped away at the concrete where it had become stuck and it finally came down at 5 30am
7362644 few people have been inside a cooling tower its such a vast amazing space
7362645 we really saw this as an opportunity for sheffield at times we really thought it might happen
7362646 i just think its unbelievable that these incredibly potent structures are being destroyed were so slow to realise the potential of these things theres nowhere in britain where a person driving can get so close to structures like this its tragic
7362647 it was the culmination of so much debate we did a survey into peoples attitudes and theres no question that everyone looked to them as a landmark some people love them and some hate them one woman said they were like marmite there were no camps on one side or the other yesterday everyone was just together
7362648 the embassy continues to consider a number of options to help bolster security and accommodate growth
7362649 relocation is one option so is reconstruction redesign renovation no decision on the embassys future has yet been made
7362650 it all depends on market conditions and it is in the governments gift to decide when to sell it
7362651 the main worry the mpc should have about the fall in sterling is whether it will have a significant positive impact on growth
7362652 there is worrying evidence that uk manufacturers are preferring to use the lower pound as cover to raise their prices and profit margins rather than to expand market share and production volumes
7362653 one of the most striking features of the last year is the way in which wage inflation has remained subdued despite the rise in headline inflation and despite the fall in the exchange rate
7362654 and with the labour market outlook worsening markedly there is no reason to expect the latest fall in sterling to generate any second round inflationary consequences that would concern the mpc
7362655 a break up will do nothing to accelerate the delivery of that i think baa is focused on the issue
7362656 thats a big stick but at the moment its all carrot with baa
7362657 i believe the government recognises the importance to the uk of an efficient hub airport and a third runway
7362658 i believe there was a weak economic case for building a second runway at stansted but a strong case for heathrow
7362659 like criticising british energy for not building new nuclear power stations in the 1990s politically it was not going to happen
7362660 the movie is built round the travestied homosexuality of the murderer robert walker provides the role with a meatier more introverted unhealthier savor than the stars usually give a hollywood production this is partly the result of hitchcocks mechanical and spurious use of the new close up style of camera work which is evidently aimed at fetishists who like to study pores here he has given walker an oily puffy face and made him skitter his eyes back and forth horizontally until it appears that the actor looks at everybody as if he were reading a book
7362661 creates uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7362662 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production
7362663 instead they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil dependent countries
7362664 is nonetheless nudging people in the direction that somebody thinks will make them better off
7362665 a combination of british energy and centrica solves the problems facing both companies today together they can work out a joint venture with edf to build nuclear sites
7362666 a possible merger of centrica with british energy if terms could be agreed and all parties are fully supportive
7362667 can you honestly think of a way that just 2 a month could do more good for good
7362668 how many times have you heard an appeal for the homeless or the hungry well what about those who arent homeless or hungry dont they deserve charity too simon is a merchant banker he owns a villa in the south of france simon is rich what do you do when you see a rich person do you turn the other way do you feel sick inside people like simon dont want your pity they want your money without enormous sums of money their lives are not worth living so please send any amount however large to help the loaded po box 4 zurich switzerland thank you
7362669 are you people nuts youre going to vote for a man wholl appoint supreme court judges wholl outlaw abortion rights because youre mad at me and howard dean
7362670 does a political party have a convincing programme of policies
7362671 would this party leader be the kind of person you would like to have round for a beer at the family barbecue
7362672 of course youre worried i understand how you feel we feel it too i know its not fair it shouldnt be like this
7362673 the free market economy is the fairest way of rewarding people for their efforts
7362674 well give every parent the right to take money currently allocated to their childrens education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities
7362675 the big question is not what will government do but what will society do not so much what will i do but what will you do
7362676 its nothing to do with me im just the boss
7362677 countries like finland are often cited for their all through schools which provide one seamless education for children through primary and secondary age
7362678 there are obvious benefits to this style of education and in ashington we can bring that continuity while making use of existing school sites with the option of building extra new facilities where needed
7362679 this is another innovative development in the academy programme that will drive up standards of education for local children this isnt invention for its own sake weve looked at what needs to happen in ashington and developed a model that answers that need
7362680 we have done research which shows that the jury is still out on city academies you need five years to be able to evaluate the progress these schools are making and it is too early to judge whether they should be rolled out to effectively replace state school education
7362681 primary schools are smaller than secondary schools and really do depend on a relationship between each other which would make this a really damaging leap in the dark for the academies programme
7362682 there arent many french women who were famous the world over who defined their era represented the image of their country moved among the greats of this world and lived a life full of twists and turns drama and big love affairs
7362683 while waiting to watch the life of carla bruni sarkozy or catherine deneuve producers are going crazy for coco chanel
7362684 coco chanel is a very important woman for the french
7362685 she was a woman who liberated other women she gave them power a very feminine kind of power
7362686 it represents a new state of mind in france in which the lives of celebrities have become just as interesting as those of fictional characters celebrity has become the modern religion
7362687 we now have a president who divorced and remarried a supermodel
7362688 it supports our argument that these certificates should be rolled out to all buildings because without the label nobody is going to do anything about it
7362689 our rating for eland house tells us we must clearly do better to make a difference to our energy performance
7362690 we are now acting on recommendations from our advisory report to help us improve future ratings
7362691 when you talk to the policy strategists at hmrc they say the regime is benign and all their staff follow the rules but we find ordinary taxpayers have a very different experience on the ground
7362692 these are hugely draconian proposals that would allow the treasury to unjustly enrich itself at the expense of individual taxpayers the banks have been criticised for their unfair charges but if the banks shouldnt operate in this way why should hmrc
7362693 permitting hmrc to issue daily fines without authorisation from the general or special commissioners would remove a vital legal protection for taxpayers against the arbitrary use of power regardless of whether taxpayers could appeal the balance is shifted firmly in hmrcs favour and would inevitably result in greater use of daily fines
7362694 we want to encourage competitive sports in schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years
7362695 in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of sports are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7362696 correct the tragic mistake of reducing the competitive element in school sports
7362697 she was not happy to settle for a silver she went full throttle for the gold i think that is the spirit we want to encourage in our schools
7362698 today is handover day at the olympics and people are going to be looking at what were going to be doing in the next few years as london becomes the olympic city
7362699 we want our olympic legacy to be more than that to be about extending opportunity for sport extend it in schools giving children the opportunity to do sports they have never done before so that the next 10 years becomes a decade of sporting success for this country
7362700 we are prepared to put the money in even in these difficult economic times
7362701 it will inspire fitness and help tackle obesity the olympics can inspire people more people will give up smoking less people will become obese london will be different from beijing but they have set a very high standard
7362702 by 2012 there will be a generation of children inspired by our heroes in beijing weve now got 19 gold medals this is a new opportunity to follow in their footsteps
7362703 kiss and make up long enough to play a few money spinning gigs
7362704 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7362705 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7362706 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale
7362707 whatever the bbc says and does it will get it in the neck
7362708 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7362709 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7362710 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under
7362711 going to begin to pretend how the economics of this would work
7362712 there are some more general broader rights for which a charter is the more suitable instrument
7362713 for example you have the right to be believed in anything you tell the revenue authorities unless there is evidence that what you are saying is not true the revenue authorities should collect the right amount of tax not necessarily the maximum amount of tax which could be levied you have the right to be represented at a meeting with the revenue authorities by a person of your choice
7362714 with the number of final salary schemes plunging to a record low they have now become gold dust for those employees who still have them employers can turn this to their advantage because the schemes give them a competitive edge in the fight to attract and retain talent
7362715 while regulation improved life expectancy and market volatility have all served to increase pressures on employers sponsoring db pension schemes good scheme design can play a vital role in mitigating their effects
7362716 a sequence of editing was mistakenly broadcast in the wrong order on some bbc news bulletins
7362717 after the event pictures showing the athletes intense frustration were sent to the news desk without time coding and were mistakenly edited into the report while this did not alter the editorial direction of our reports we regret that these pictures were not shown in chronological order in the sports coverage of the event shots were shown in the correct order
7362718 thankfully its human beings that make tv and human beings that watch them and human beings are illogical irrational and unfair
7362719 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7362720 dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead i had to keep giving her the sad news over and over again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7362721 it was pretty obvious when i last saw her in november 2005 that she was pretty off the map so to speak but like with reagan people give former heads of state some dignity because of the stigma attached
7362722 we know she has had small strokes and these lead to memory loss you can still have a conversation with her about contemporary politics dementia is a very emotive word which conjures up a very particular image in conversation thatcher may need a bit of occasional reminding but then so do we all
7362723 we were driven by a desire to modernise the unions image and modernise our communications
7362724 ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all
7362725 part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
7362726 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards
7362727 therefore much of the money raised should be used to kickstart a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor
7362728 after all so many of them were in jail for things they actually had nothing to do with many were convicted by signing false statements under torture or under the flimsiest of evidence and were locked away for years
7362729 prisoners cant get jobs because of their convictions or even insurance or loans in some cases they cant get into countries like the us canada or australia so if they can wipe their record clean by proving that the convictions against them were unjust and flawed why not
7362730 but no similar mechanism to explore all the wrong doings that went on in the barracks and police stations
7362731 most of the loyalist prisoners just think its time to get on with their lives now that the conflict is over unlike republicans who want to prove a point about the state and its role in the troubles the loyalists are just happy to be free and living their lives again
7362732 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7362733 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7362734 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7362735 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7362736 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions
7362737 two out of the five big pharmaceutical companies are allegedly looking into their pricing and if they are prepared to go back and look at the cost of their drugs to make them more cost effective then i welcome that
7362738 whilst the current level of bookings for summer 2008 is in line with forecasts the signs for 2009 are less clear cut
7362739 an increase in the number of insolvencies is an indicator of tougher trading conditions and may be an indication of a further deterioration later this year
7362740 victory parade for team gb but funding may be cut
7362741 o you who believe fasting has been written upon you as it was written for those before you so that you may gain taqwa
7362742 haarisa min qalbi sincerely from my heart or i did it to be known khutbath duroor loving to be known breaks it
7362743 i have a business but i am going to be silent
7362744 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7362745 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7362746 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7362747 oh yes our phone call you know i have had 12 other offers since then one was for 14 000
7362748 dont worry we made a deal at 7 900 and thats the price i accept from you
7362749 listen to haydns trios marvellous its all there you need nothing more
7362750 if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden
7362751 my friends we are facing the transcendent challenge of the 21st century
7362752 the young men and women who are serving us in uniform
7362753 if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get osama bin laden and bring him to justice
7362754 baghdad mosul basra and iraq and throughout the world its not just in iraq its not just in afghanistan even here in the united states of america
7362755 we are winning and we are succeeding and our troops will come home with honor and with victory and not in defeat
7362756 is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
7362757 based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
7362758 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
7362759 if any man do a cruelty in my name then though he says the name aslan it is tash that he serves
7362760 ich will jetzt nicht st r mich nicht ich brauch noch ein bi chen zum laden
7362761 le solde migratoire en france est en r alit quasiment nul
7362762 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7362763 thank you to china to all the wonderful volunteers and to bocog the beijing organizing committee
7362764 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7362765 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7362766 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7362767 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7362768 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in hyperactivity capital
7362769 mccain is a far more mercurial emotional and volatile character than obama despite being a generation older he will be 72 on friday he is temperamentally much younger than his rival there is a lot of churchill in mccain the melodrama and the sanctimony the mawkishness and the sincerity the big heart and sometimes faulty judgment
7362770 your credit by removing negative and damaging information even when its
7362771 manches was wir von gott denken haben wir von den alten griechen so ist das nun mal mit der kultur
7362772 its hard for people to believe that now how upsetting the play was
7362773 most people at the time were writing about how horrible war was about vietnam
7362774 and i wrote a play about three people who didnt give a damn
7362775 producers didnt think that three women could carry a play
7362776 i was attacked because i was a man writing about women
7362777 but if wendy wasserstein had come before me instead of after i probably would never have written it
7362778 you cant be a wife and a businesswoman you have to be one or the other and all that
7362779 we didnt sit around and say oh this is a play about liberating women because we were in the midst of it
7362780 i dont think we had that perspective but it was a departure in that you had this story that ended on the demise of the friendship everything wasnt tied up in a little bow
7362781 it was different to realize that three women could stop being friends
7362782 it was more truthful than a lot of other plays the reality is you dont necessarily stay friends
7362783 i thought i was making a statement about the society i was raised in about people being given the wrong set of values for life which could be men or women
7362784 i had resisted all these years making vanities into a musical
7362785 i didnt want it to turn into grease or something people wanted to add a lot more characters and all the boyfriends
7362786 i had thought at the 25th anniversary of the play that there would probably be a revival in new york and that fell apart producer wise
7362787 so what we actually ended up doing for the 25th anniversary celebration was to do it here in l a as a benefit
7362788 a musical based on jacks play struck me as a genuinely clever and commercial idea
7362789 in fact i was looking forward to actually seeing it in a new york production
7362790 about a year ago randy adams one of the producers involved contacted me
7362791 he said that for various reasons the production had been delayed and they were looking for a good regional house prior to mounting it on broadway
7362792 my experience of musicals has not been a lot of fun
7362793 ive tended to think that there are too many cooks on a musical what i love about playwriting is that its usually just the playwright and the director and you own it and you can pretty much control its destiny thats not true on a musical
7362794 just in terms of dialogue ive given up a lot funny things character development
7362795 but then there was also the opportunity to add some things
7362796 in that sense the musical is quite different because its celebrating friendships where the play is really about the demise of a friendship
7362797 i mean the other day one of them turned to me and said whats a pillbox hat and you go oh my god its history to them and they dont even know what happened
7362798 i guess they just think they can ignore that part of the bible
7362799 we all do that we all ignore parts we are just as guilty as they are
7362800 i began to see that christians read the bible differently and i began to see that no one group seemed to get it all right
7362801 we need twenty first century christians living out the biblical gospel in twenty first century ways
7362802 the biblical way is the ongoing adoption of the past and adaptation to new conditions and to do this in a way that is consistent with and faithful to the bible
7362803 we dare not ignore what god has said to the church through the ages nor dare we fossilize past interpretations into traditionalism
7362804 any reading and any interpretation that does not lead to good works both as the practical application and as the behavioral result aborts what the bible is designed to produce
7362805 marks a wonderful guy and i think this could be the real thing
7362806 thanks for thinking of me but i dont have too much to say about the impending launch of sly
7362807 my advice to sly i wouldnt want to say anything that would put a frown on his face oh no longer possible
7362808 a review of the concert film fade to black in weekend yesterday misidentified a star appearing in the film with the rapper jay z she was foxy brown not lil kim because of an editing error a picture caption misidentified the singer dressed all in white he was r kelly not jay z
7362809 um thats really interesting mary kate is that the name of a book though the question was whats your favorite book not candy
7362810 i dont care i hate books i like tootsie rolls
7362811 i was in the laundry and i realized i was standing right next to nadal
7362812 i didnt bother him but he was shoving all his colours and whites in together i really wanted to say dude youre going to have a nightmare with that you cant just put the whole bag in there are reds in with whites but what can you do
7362813 actually i walked up to rafael nadal and he is probably my favourite tennis player to watch and i walked up to him and i was like i just want to meet you and dont want to take a picture or anything i just want to meet you and i told him i watch you all the time when you play tennis and i love watching you play tennis i told him good luck that is probably the only person
7362814 finding middle ground santa monica is lacking homes that the majority of middle class workers can afford raising concern
7362815 these are chicken burritos those are beef burritos these are refried beans thats rice and that stuff is all for taco salad
7362816 duhhhhhhhhh wheres the govmunt cheez and below knee you mean no one brought a jello mold or tuner noodle cassy roll with tater chips
7362817 no vamos a hacer desfilar a las monjas en traje de ba o
7362818 pero ser fea no es un requisito para convertirse en monja la belleza externa es un regalo de dios y no debemos ocultarlo
7362819 las monjas est n un poco excluidas est n un poco marginadas en la vida eclesi stica
7362820 esta ser una ocasi n para hacer que su contribuci n sea m s visible
7362821 votar por la monja a la que consideren una modelo
7362822 we could run a nice blog here if we didnt have all these members getting in the way
7362823 that would have put them in greater danger of being attacked by terrorist i find it easier to believe that history books tell lies than to believe that american would do such a cruel and foolish thing
7362824 if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen
7362825 lets not have the kind of stalinist politics that the state of new york the republican party has been practicing
7362826 this is outrageous outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement
7362827 theres only three things he mccain mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and pow
7362828 i think the best way of doing good to the poor is not making them easy in poverty but leading them or driving them out of it
7362829 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
7362830 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
7362831 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation
7362832 when we work with people we hang out listen to records share stuff
7362833 but with britney we had absolutely no way of communicating she didnt know anything that we knew
7362834 now doesnt seem the right time maybe next week when her schedules more flexible
7362835 you can argue that the shape shifting feminist hip pop of ms aguilera is every bit as radical as the punk rock of the 1970s and it is
7362836 hip and acceptable even if i wont really listen to it more then to just get the basic gist of what i think it means
7362837 thanks largely to the mania for televised poker a night out for adolescent boys and it is virtually all boys in nearly any suburban town these days almost invariably takes the form of a marathon game with stakes as low as the 5 buy in at this game or considerably higher at some impromptu tournaments
7362838 as long as we know how to read i know well be alright
7362839 i dont want to start teaching again i am for sure ruining their education
7362840 rawkus 50 phenomenon tha connection appeared on 12 bits digital release
7362841 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7362842 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7362843 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7362844 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7362845 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7362846 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7362847 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7362848 quando um grupo de torcedores faz isso de forma coletiva escreve que a mancha n o gostou do desempenho ou que a fiel n o gostou algo mais oficial o que mais me assustou naquelas picha es que elas foram muito dirigidas
7362849 quando falam que o diego souza n o vinha jogando bem ou que a defesa tem problema nas bolas paradas temos de aceitar mas o que me preocupa quando as cr ticas s o dirigidas duas ou tr s pessoas v o l e picham e depois todo mundo tira foto para dizer que a torcida est contra n s aquilo era ofensivo e n o tinha como ajudar
7362850 cada um que est aqui sabe de suas qualidades e defici ncias e trabalha em cima disso eu estou concentrado no meu trabalho e procuro sempre dar o melhor de mim para o palmeiras sei que muita coisa precisa ser consertada mas estou tranq ilo com isso
7362851 arriscamos mais temos que analisar a partida jogamos mais do que o time deles o rog rio ceni n o fez nenhuma defesa dif cil por outro lado o goleiro do coritiba vanderlei foi bem mais exigido
7362852 o melhor resultado seria uma vit ria temos que ganhar fora de casa isso fundamental para qualquer equipe para isso precisamos apertar o advers rio temos que arriscar vamos trabalhar ainda mais para voltar a vencer longe do morumbi
7362853 i am sorry to have to tell you this but there was a fire on the edge of town and your factory was burned to the ground
7362854 what the first messenger reported was a mistake your factory is safe
7362855 no it was nothing like that i could see that the challenge was far too much for you to handle so it wasnt possible that the first messenger had told the truth
7362856 in kesuvos 33b we find that if chananiah mishael and azarya had actually been subject to torture they would have indeed bowed to nevuchadnezzars idol why does the gemara record this apparently insulting hypothesis clearly the object is not to denigrate these great tzaddikim chazal shared this with us so that we would understand that these three were not subject to torture because hashem knew they couldnt overcome the trial of torture we learn a very important lesson from our gemara hashem doesnt give us more than we can handle
7362857 the goal is to supply people with everything they might need to know to make the smartest decisions
7362858 easier access to timely and useful water weather and climate information will save lives property and resources
7362859 the southeast marine weather portal has been developed with the end user the mariner sailor surfer beachgoer in mind
7362860 the portal provides the information they need to make safe and informed decisions before going out on the water or to the beach
7362861 noaa is committed to providing the public accurate real time ocean and coastal water and weather data to support public safety navigation and commerce
7362862 these new noaa sentinels will ensure that critical water and wind information is available during severe storms when its needed most
7362863 this technology will deliver real time storm tide data during severe coastal events that will allow emergency managers to take appropriate action and will provide information to help protect life and property
7362864 i am pleased noaa has worked to install these sentinels at locations off the coast of mississippi and louisiana
7362865 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7362866 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7362867 on the surface that seems really good but in the long term it could actually drive out independents and that would be lessening competition and in the long term that wouldnt be good for motorists
7362868 in extremely poor taste and it should not have been used to promote london
7362869 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7362870 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7362871 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point
7362872 however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7362873 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7362874 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7362875 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7362876 and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7362877 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers that what it comes down to
7362878 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7362879 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7362880 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7362881 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7362882 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7362883 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7362884 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7362885 the second quarter gdp data will be revised higher because of the trade numbers but the market will be looking more closely at some of the more forward looking data to see what will happen next what is the extent of the economic slowdown going forward
7362886 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
7362887 we are going to change the constitution and say on nov
7362888 were just polling yes or no not trying to find converts or change peoples minds
7362889 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
7362890 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time
7362891 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok

7362893 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7362894 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7362895 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7362896 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7362897 they wont let the economic statement through the senate and now theyre apparently demanding another statement
7362898 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to
7362899 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector
7362900 on the surface that seems really good but in the long term it could actually drive out independents and that would be lessening competition and in the long term that wouldnt be good for motorists
7362901 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers that what it comes down to
7362902 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7362903 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7362904 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7362905 a lot of the vanity buys are going to go away
7362906 pcs in use reached nearly 1b units worldwide at year end 2006
7362907 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners

7362909 has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7362910 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7362911 thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7362912 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7362913 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7362914 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7362915 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7362916 they wont let the economic statement through the senate and now theyre apparently demanding another statement
7362917 considering how high they gas prices are just going out and getting some things sometimes helps
7362918 this is a kit that just goes on to any bike and it has these big wide loaders in the back so you can take your grocery bags they give you and drop them right in there
7362919 this is a great way to avoid using your car and save on gas and help our own national dependence on foreign oil
7362920 its really hard to keep them in stock as soon as we get stuff we sell it right out
7362921 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7362922 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth

7362927 i wasnt really surprised i knew he was going to come back sometime on some holes
7362928 i was expecting that to happen and since he made that chip in i was thinking ive got to play well and keep focused on my game try to make birdies
7362929 im usually that guy that would not be happy about anything going good for anybody else
7362930 it was kind of fun to watch i mean he was making everything what are you going to do hes pouring it in we all have those days
7362931 the movie is built round the travestied homosexuality of the murderer robert walker provides the role with a meatier more introverted unhealthier savor than the stars usually give a hollywood production this is partly the result of hitchcocks mechanical and spurious use of the new close up style of camera work which is evidently aimed at fetishists who like to study pores here he has given walker an oily puffy face and made him skitter his eyes back and forth horizontally until it appears that the actor looks at everybody as if he were reading a book
7362932 the challenged statutes give constitutionally adequate notice of the conduct prohibited and sufficiently determine guidelines for law enforcement
7362933 i have a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion and all the other veterans service organizations
7362934 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
7362935 oh yes our phone call you know i have had 12 other offers since then one was for 14 000
7362936 dont worry we made a deal at 7 900 and thats the price i accept from you

7362940 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
7362941 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
7362942 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey

7362945 aber es gibt gute neuigkeiten wir m ssen keine vier jahre bush und mccain mehr ertragen
7362946 das ist keine gew hnliche zeit das ist keine gew hnliche wahl
7362947 mehr als einen guten soldaten sie erfordert einen weisen anf hrer
7362948 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
7362949 yes but we dont live in a perfect world we had no alternative because we had gotten to the point where we werent negotiating all they were doing was saying no and we had to show them that we were serious about our intentions
7362950 we had a negotiating committee that was stocked with a lot of working writers and it looked as if the companies plan was to keep the tv season going right through the hiatus along with going ahead with a lot of movies
7362951 and at that point it looked like the dga and aftra would have been willing to go ahead and make a deal so had we extended we would have been out on strike with sag and there would have been plenty of stockpiled material
7362952 when youre dealing with an asymmetrical organization like the amptp the element of surprise is enormously important we also had to deal with the realization that there was an enormous amount of stockpiling going on there were about 150 movies going into production and the networks were approving series without pilots so hindsight being 20 20 it was the right thing to do
7362953 features kept being shot during the strike but series went dead
7362954 we always thought we were going to do well in the new media area we came out about where we thought we would except for sell through there we got a better deal probably because the the wga strike

7362971 be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are now written in a very foreign tongue do not now seek the answers which cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps you will then gradually without noticing it live along some distant day into the answer

7362994 es una pena que el trabajo que ven amos realizando se fuera a la basura de esa forma ten amos oportunidad de sumar puntos importantes para poder llegar a la fecha final con mayores posibilidades en la lucha por el campeonato pero desafortunadamente este resultado nos aleja del t tulo

7363007 it is a total disgrace that this proud night for britain has been sullied by this grotesque representation
7363008 for older people missed meals in hospital can be as big a risk to safety as missing medication
7363009 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7363010 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7363011 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7363012 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7363013 mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware that she was doing so
7363014 it might be something innocuous like what time is my car coming
7363015 i also had to learn she had an illness and that it wasnt personal
7363016 hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7363017 further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the uk

7363020 i would like to apologise to customers who experience disruption over the bank holiday weekend
7363021 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7363022 we have had serious crime in the past as you would expect at an event of this size we want to disrupt and deter the small minority who commit crimes here each year
7363023 the recent erratic weather has led to an interest in getting away for the bank holiday it also seems people are prepared to pay quite significant amounts
7363024 very fortunate to have been granted any of his time and he was not going to do an
7363025 there is a growing tendency to call for people to be allowed to stay on in britain even if there is no risk of persecution if they return to their own countries yet the more the government fails to remove the more it brings the law into disrepute
7363026 our borders are stronger than ever with asylum applications at an historic low and an immigration offender removed every eight minutes
7363027 the total number of asylum seekers receiving any type of support between april and june this year fell by 36 per cent when compared to the same period in 2007
7363028 as we suspected with the job market turning down and employers shedding staff it appears to be older workers and particularly older women who are bearing the brunt of many lay offs
7363029 employers need to remember that employment tribunals can award uncapped compensation in respect of any successful age discrimination claim and we do expect the number of claims to rise as more redundancies occur
7363030 with the rising cost of living many older people have to find ways to supplement their income
7363031 so it is not surprising that there has been an increase in the number of people of pensionable age choosing to carry on working
7363032 so although there may be a desire or need to continue working older people may find it increasingly difficult to do so
7363033 i think that if discrimination of this sort is taking place it is being done very subtly
7363034 there was a raft of publicity which accompanied the introduction of the employment equality regulations especially surrounding last in first out being indirectly discriminatory and the potential for uncapped compensation bills
7363035 as was the case with disability discrimination it often takes several years for claimants and their advisers to get to grips with new legislation and start bringing claims
7363036 does a political party have a convincing programme of policies
7363037 would this party leader be the kind of person you would like to have round for a beer at the family barbecue

7363040 well give every parent the right to take money currently allocated to their childrens education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities
7363041 the big question is not what will government do but what will society do not so much what will i do but what will you do
7363042 its nothing to do with me im just the boss
7363043 share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7363044 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7363045 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7363046 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7363047 im still tooling around with my speech a little bit it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
7363048 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7363049 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7363050 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7363051 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7363052 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7363053 were they separated at birth or are they really one in the same
7363054 oh im disappointed to hear that i thought that if you could have all of those children run for city council and have an affair you have the energy we need on the council
7363055 this is a massive step forward in achieving our vision of a renewed caledonian forest
7363056 the producers said that they wouldnt use the original songs for the remake instead they will be having new songs to feature
7363057 oh really thats a waste of money understand that im not making this as a total comparison but it would be like saying hey lets go remake casablanca you should just leave those things alone
7363058 why would anyone want to do a remake of a cult classic
7363059 weve been keeping an eye on it and we could see from one week to the next the evaporation was pretty serious
7363060 as the water diminishes theyre going to get less oxygen and just create more problems

7363063 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7363064 was a lot faster than me and went ahead and got to my back bumper and just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7363065 he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7363066 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion
7363067 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7363068 i guess it remains to be seen its like i said last week if theres only one guy i have to race thats awesome

7363073 the market in australia is much different than that in the u s and brand marketers continuously gravitate to traditional media outlets forgetting how successful the internet can be in targeting highly engaged audiences such as food enthusiasts
7363074 advertisers that work with gourmet ads can target consumers that value high quality food beer and wine this audience relies on long tail culinary sites for recipes ideas and other resources that satisfy their interests marketers need to reach them on the sites that they visit while they are in the right frame of mind and are thinking about food
7363075 benjamins expertise as a television presenter cookbook author and culinary educator has led to the creation of one of the most unique ad networks to date
7363076 today long tail culinary sites are being sought due to the growing interest in cooking and food in general which has not only hit the united states but other countries as well with more individuals gravitating towards the kitchen table an effective way of reaching them is through vertical ad networks that cater to the need of the culinarily engaged

7363085 were confident that barack obama will win this election when working class voters middle income voters know who he is and what he stands for

7363101 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7363102 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7363103 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much
7363104 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7363105 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7363106 i am surprised and disappointed that i am not being rewarded for having scored consistently in the first class season
7363107 i was really looking forward to playing against a testing opposition that australia a would surely be
7363108 the thing about eating the black and white cookie elaine is you want to get some black and some white in each bite nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate and yet somehow racial harmony eludes us if people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be solved

7363111 by which a political leader with the help of a handful of courtiers shapes and reshapes instruments of power at will
7363112 we need to define preferably in law the role of the prime minister cabinet and the public service and give public servants an administrative space of their own to manage government operations while recognizing that the prime minister and ministers must always have the authority to override public servants in all matters not covered by statutes
7363113 those with the power to introduce change for the better are reluctant to do so because they enjoy being able to wield tremendous power
7363114 parliamentarians it seems have turned over much of their accountability responsibilities to officers of parliament and to the media
7363115 parliament is the one institution that truly should matter to canadians the only one that constitutes the democratic link between citizens and their government and connects citizens from and so it is in parliament we must address the current weaknesses of our common political life
7363116 prejudged situations was not impartial and was preoccupied with the media
7363117 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7363118 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7363119 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7363120 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7363121 some years ago people would have frowned on grey water but now its going to be the fashion
7363122 and not just for a week but for whole seasons
7363123 we used to operate eight sprinklers at a time now we can run 36 at a time
7363124 from taking three days to water the course it now takes 12 hours
7363125 the total venture has cost 448 000 and the government grant was a major assistance
7363126 the dam will pay for itself in the long run
7363127 were speaking to some businesses demanding some kind of overall supply
7363128 theres about 180 abnormalities that the children can have but the children may only get five or six
7363129 velo is the palette the cardio part is general heart defects and the facial part is that the children can have certain features that make them look similar to each other
7363130 most of the problems they pick it up with is feeding or speech because of the palette
7363131 we got rushed to westmead with her heart condition and our cardiologist was aware of the syndrome and saw the features of madelines face and went and got the tests done
7363132 for the kids that just have the palette problems they might not get detected until right down the track
7363133 we think that she madeline doesnt look much different to a normal child and i dont think except she had a stroke shed be looked at as differently
7363134 the emotion of her having a heart condition and then being told she had a chromosome missing was pretty hard
7363135 the schools been really good and very sensitive to her needs
7363136 learning is obviously a big issue but theres the social side as well because shes quite shy and withdrawn and she picks out a couple of her friends
7363137 now that shes getting older were focusing on schooling and the social side of things making sure she functions as normally as she can
7363138 the next big stage is high school and looking at how shes going to be treated
7363139 all the kids at school know her and at the moment they dont see her as different shes just madeline to them
7363140 that man may be one of the 67 hunter valley men who were killed in action or who died of wounds at the battle of messines
7363141 there are reports this man discovered at messines last week also had a spiked german
7363142 there were quite a few of those helmets lying around the battlefield and of course the aussies were reknown as souvenir gatherers
7363143 but i believe the discovery of this diggers remains are very unusual
7363144 it appears he was buried as a result of an artillery shell exploding near him
7363145 about 1200 hunter valley men in the 33rd 34th 35th and 36th battalions fought in the initial six day battle with 128 being killed or dying of wounds
7363146 it was the first major battle these men had been thrown into
7363147 and it was the first time in the war that the 3rd and 4th australian divisions had encountered concrete blockhouses
7363148 these were used by the germans to protect their machine guns and crews during enemy artillery bombardments
7363149 im not an engineer but the closer you take a bypass to maitland the more problems you would have with water and soft soil
7363150 camp road majors lane and sawyers gully have become a back road a pseudo f3 bypass
7363151 we shouldnt be stuffing around with the planning the project is already planned
7363152 there needs to be greater investment in parking at maitland and surrounding train stations
7363153 fifty per cent of our members have said they would travel by parking their car at a train station and taking the train to their destination if the proper facilities were available
7363154 that means we need investment in parking security personnel closed circuit television cameras properly located stations and proper bus transport to and from train stations
7363155 we are going backwards the current budget wasnt good enough
7363156 there was only 2 million of new commitments and that was for planning of the inner city bypass in newcastle
7363157 but im very confident about more funds to come because i know that our region is growing quickly we need to continue to focus on putting to government what the regional priorities are in terms of roads and other infrastructure
7363158 i think its important that the nrma talks to every regional stakeholder to ensure that we are in tune with each other
7363159 im giving a commitment to take it to the next level
7363160 the major road that runs from east maitland to hexham has a congestion issue that is not solved yet
7363161 once we see what the solution is to the f3 which we wont know until the end of the year we can focus on what we need to do to improve that leg
7363162 we need to have our major projects listed as priorities with infrastructure australia the state governments 10 year infrastructure plan and the state or federal budget

7363180 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers that what it comes down to
7363181 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7363182 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7363183 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7363184 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7363185 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7363186 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7363187 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7363188 fuelwatch wont work wont give the benefits to consumers that its meant to

7363531 i knew there would be other more prominent national democratic figures who wanted to speak and frankly i dont want to use up any chits i have with president obama on a speaking role at 3 oclock in the afternoon on a weekday
7363532 when a friend of yours is in a fight you dont want him to have to stop in the middle of it just to blow you kisses
7363533 i believe there are going to be quite a few previous clinton supporters who are going to register their support for senator clinton during the appropriate roll call but in the end ill be surprised if theres not a unanimous new jersey roll call for senator obama
7363534 who felt that someone from south jersey with the kind of field experience tricia mueller had would be the better approach
7363535 i have a number of young staffers who have never been to a democratic convention and they are such a hard working conscientious bunch of young people who work so hard on behalf of my constituents i wanted to reward them by giving them this trip at my campaigns expense
7363536 theres only team obama theres no team rothman at this democratic national convention were all about advancing the cause of our presidential nominee
7363537 they asked me if i was interested and i said no thank you
7363538 i knew there would be other more prominent national democratic figures who wanted to speak and frankly i dont want to use up any chits i have with president obama on a speaking role at 3 oclock in the afternoon on a weekday
7363539 when a friend of yours is in a fight you dont want him to have to stop in the middle of it just to blow you kisses
7363540 i believe there are going to be quite a few previous clinton supporters who are going to register their support for senator clinton during the appropriate roll call but in the end ill be surprised if theres not a unanimous new jersey roll call for senator obama
7363541 who felt that someone from south jersey with the kind of field experience tricia mueller had would be the better approach
7363542 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a heeler hes going to be
7363543 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7363544 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7363545 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7363546 we robustly and aggressively rebut all of this i would challenge you to go to alton towers legoland chessington world of adventures or any of our attractions and tell me that you didnt think that we were right on the button with this weve invested a huge amount in providing healthy eating options across all our attractions
7363547 one of the ironies of all this which these people forget is that its mum and dad that should be left alone to make their own decisions
7363548 for a lot of people a day out at a theme park is a break from daily life theyre out for a memorable day out i think people are fed up with being lectured about what they should do by government authorities and do gooders there is an agenda on healthy eating and we are doing our bit but at the end of the day people should be left to make their own choices
7363549 at a recent event in the house of commons she criticised large visitor attractions for poor customer service
7363550 yet she had never been to any of our businesses and she had never asked to meet either me or anybody else from the industry i dont know where she got that information from but it was clearly not based on any knowledge which is unfortunately the problem with tourism at dcms they dont understand what they are doing if i had the chance to meet her i would put in front of her our customer satisfaction scores then id ask her what on earth she was talking about
7363551 if i could just address that issue because i hate leaving these things hanging in the air im absolutely passionate about this business and we are totally focused on customer satisfaction
7363552 i really felt very uncomfortable just now when the bollywood section was cordoned off holding back our customers from what theyd paid for i hate it its the most depressing thing in the world when visitors are unhappy and the most fantastic thing in the world when theyre happy we i think more than any other company in the leisure market measure visitor satisfaction endlessly
7363553 they dont like being at the bottom of it i can tell you
7363554 we have a very high target disney have said publicly that they regard 80 per cent as their benchmark for customer satisfaction ours at merlin is 90 per cent
7363555 when people say to me we are expensive well for six to eight hours of high quality entertainment and education a clean environment and great customer service then i say please tell me why thats expensive
7363556 ive been in the business 18 years and my experience has been unequivocally that we do ok in a recession we are not immune from it but were quite resilient people cut out foreign holidays but they still have to take the kids out to do things at the moment it looks like were heading for a good year
7363557 i feel like a kid who has been let loose in the biggest sweet shop in the world
7363558 we regularly get in hot water with the church for doing a satans grotto at christmas we did a pr stunt last christmas giving free entry to people with antisocial behaviour orders and got into lots of trouble we see the dungeons as being deliberately anti establishment its a brand for teenagers and young adults so its irreverent the humour is intrinsic
7363559 i can honestly say we didnt set out to be controversial in berlin
7363560 im a great believer that if youre really passionate about something why shouldnt you want to be no 1 and shoot to be the best its what americans call a great big hairy assed goal
7363561 i wrote a paper for hermes saying there was an opportunity to be a global leader but hermes said they didnt have the equity to back that scale of acquisition
7363562 joe took that leap of faith that this little company and its management team could deliver the 102 5million cheque was the smallest they had signed
7363563 we need the markets to recover then well consider which options to go for at the moment we have the great advantage of most of the big banks in london coming to us and proferring free advice trying to get themselves into the running
7363564 a very big slug for anyone to swallow i think a couple of their parks are fantastic i wouldnt rule anything out but that would be a scarily big deal and in current markets with the leverage situation it would be difficult for anyone to do but if it were to be formally put up for sale then clearly we would have a look at it
7363565 frankly i blame the board they didnt ask questions they didnt get the answers theres a real credibility gap
7363566 999 as some teams call it puts two outside vertical routes on the two safeties thus leaving the mike to run with the other two
7363567 and as you know the senator has some positions that dont go along with the catholic church
7363568 the bishops conference has left it to the individual bishops to decide how they want to handle it
7363569 its kind of appropriate that the almighty god placed him here today because sen biden is here
7363570 as you know he has just received a new appointment and how could we not know about that the senator has received this appointment as we understand because of his expertise in foreign affairs
7363571 its nice that he gets a little educating this morning about some of the needs of our church and the community as well in south india
7363572 that he may find increased wisdom and strength as he becomes more involved in the presidential campaign as candidate for vice president

7363575 it is first a vulnerability then an exploit and some even incorporate automation and self propogation the goal is to offer a no surprises early warning environment from exploits such as sasser

7363583 russia has the potential to become the largest internet user market in europe its a huge market with fantastic growth every day more and more people in russia are discovering the internet
7363584 we have better technology and understanding of the market i take the competition seriously and every day check the latest figures to see where it is but i think we will stay far ahead what was enough for google to conquer other markets isnt enough in russia
7363585 in two years since google opened an office in russia we havent lost a single specialist to our competitors because yandex is one of the best companies to work for in russia
7363586 ironically my first business experience was thanks to the communist party
7363587 when the law about kooperativ was passed our boss at the institute came to us and said you guys are mathematicians you start a business we began trading computers and i was made technical director i was only 24 we were paid in hardware instead of cash and i earned two personal computers in one year a huge sum in those days enough to buy my first flat a two bedroom moscow apartment
7363588 we have brilliant mathematicians and programmers we are very strong on data analysis and have developed better technology which is cutting edge in russia we are constantly inventing new programs to stay ahead
7363589 im very proud of the fact that we have created something so successful out of nothing but above all a great brand that sends a positive signal about russia and that says something about the great talent there is here
7363590 they have never been properly reproduced but weve recovered the original information that was there
7363591 if you put headphones on with those recordings you are right in the middle of the room you hear the whole ambience

7363593 we have to stop balancing the books on the backs of taxpayers
7363594 bringing out the hard cover last year during the hectic lead in to the primaries didnt help the book because it was perceived by some to be a campaign tool its actually a fine and moving memoir
7363595 wed been holding off releasing the paperback until the election season was over when we felt people would be able to focus on the human story he is telling but clearly this is a new opportunity for the book and its a great way to get to know who this man is and what he stands for

7363626 demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system in concentrating energies to accomplish grand feats
7363627 the government has used the olympics to display its organising strength and win over the public with a new kind of self confident nationalism
7363628 perhaps western powers should expect fewer rather than more concessions from china
7363629 the chinese nations olympic dream has always been bound to its course of national revival
7363630 the beijing olympic games have added impetus for national self confidence
7363631 ordinary people will now have a stronger sense that their country really is a rising power
7363632 gold medals dont say everything because chinas sports are state backed but after all to win so many gold medals shouldnt be slighted as a sign of rising prosperity and power

7363637 confidence is high that contract negotiations will be quickly finalised by early september
7363638 most agencies seem to have some form of video conferencing they use we are doing a stocktake of that at the moment
7363639 the project is at an early stage and the first major step following workshops held by the environment ministry is for the core agencies mandated to reduce their travel to fully measure their travel kilometres in a standard comparable way
7363640 but increasingly in order to deal with complex issues and provide joined up service delivery you need to have multiple agencies working together and there is an interoperability and connectivity challenge there
7363641 but the value that you get from connecting people cant be underestimated
7363642 to find that rakon has not been included in the builds to date on the iphone
7363643 the conventions remain a big deal because it allows the parties candidates to present themselves to the country
7363644 its an opportunity for each political party to deliver its message to the american people
7363645 it gives people who havent been paying a lot of attention the chance to size up the candidate many people are undecided going into the conventions and we know from surveys that a number of voters make up their minds after watching the conventions
7363646 theyre so boring now theyre so well scripted and the parties do a good job making sure nothing too interesting happens
7363647 the only hope for excitement is if the clinton camp and the obama camp start fighting if something happens where the remaining fissures between obama and clinton are exposed
7363648 thats a possibility and i wouldnt put it past the clinton camp to do that
7363649 our party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
7363650 im not a member of any organized political party im a democrat
7363651 power and control over delegates were historically held by state party leaders
7363652 in 1968 when hubert humphrey won the democratic party nomination for president his major strategy was the courtship of party leaders he did not even enter a single primary
7363653 i learned they try to get everything wrapped up for unity and smoothness and so there arent any brouhahas i dont agree with that
7363654 the nomination speech thats the one that really matters the most
7363655 ill be looking to see if obama puts some extra meat on this rhetoric some real clear policy positions
7363656 conventions are a failure if you dont win in november they are quickly forgotten
7363657 liam has only come in this year and he looks a player who will reach higher honours in the game
7363658 i think london will put on a great show something quite different to beijing
7363659 i wanted the children to see it and learn something
7363660 beijing was great but i think that england will do ok actually i think it will be better
7363661 it would be good if he tripped up on the carpet now
7363662 any city has their own twist on the games but with the olympic movement its all about bringing the world together as one the big thing is having a place something thats different and seeing how they welcome people from all over the world
7363663 it was pretty cool standing outside buckingham palace watching the guards some of the partygoers had their own ideas about the peculiarly british twist but london could put on the event
7363664 they need to sort that out in four years time
7363665 still we did think that they could introduce queueing and whingeing as olympic events in 2012
7363666 i have had a traumatic weekend i had a few problems health wise but seemed to pull through i just woke up very early yesterday and i had a spasm in my neck fortunately ive got a great doctor it was so bad that i was struggling to stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7363667 at the start i was on the dirty side i got a reasonable start but nowhere near as quick as felipe i had to hold my spot and robert kubica was pushing quite hard for a couple of corners i was trying to keep up with felipe but it was pretty hard to overtake here
7363668 after such a bad result to come here to a new track which was new for everybody we did a fantastic job there is nothing more we can ask for especially after such a bad result engine failure in hungary which we still need to work on as we had another problem with kimi
7363669 its not nice to see those things its supposed to be a celebration right
7363670 it will be hard to say no to 1m but i could be a little superstar in amateur boxing
7363671 imagine winning another gold medal in my home city i could be the face of london 2012 id love that it would be unbelievable
7363672 i want to be able to buy a nice car and give my mum a touch but by the time ive paid for my car my bills at home im living with nothing
7363673 theyve got to be told this is raw im telling it to you straight
7363674 listen you lot got me in trouble with the on off girlfriend for seven years
7363675 whatever offers james gets i guarantee you that after london 2012 those promoters will have to triple them
7363676 earlier this month i said that beijing would be me finished but now im thinking right ok im going to 2012 if they want to sack me then they will have to sack me i shall face the music when i go back and answer all the allegations but one things for certain if i were to go forward for the next four years i wouldnt put up with the crap that ive suffered in the last four years thats for sure
7363677 but the chairman of the aba is out here the chief executive was out here im not saying they did it but if they had any problems with me all they had to do is pull me aside and have a chat
7363678 in the past year ive produced a world champion and two bronze medallists and a different olympic champion and two bronze medallists what do they want what do i have to do now
7363679 the programme weve got in place has been running for 20 months
7363680 thats what gives me the optimism that we can be the new cuba lets go to 2012 all pulling together instead of pulling apart thats what i want
7363681 victory parade for team gb but funding may be cut
7363682 four medals will clearly not be enough in london but i think i should be judged on more than a medal count
7363683 i am dc not jc so i cant categorically promise we will do better in london 2012 people werent exactly queuing up for the job when i took it on and i have given it my best shot there was a lot wrong when i arrived and i think there is a lot more right today
7363684 if were world champions at rugby it doesnt mean we are at football athletics is an immensely competitive sport over 200 nations here with over 40 of them winning medals here this is a genuine world sport and my concern is entirely and utterly with what i see when i look at my team
7363685 this is a big challenge this is a seriously challenging sport and i am satisfied with the steps that we have made if other people are not then that is their decision and i will have to abide by it i have heard nothing so i will continue to carry on working
7363686 i am on six months contract i should know by the end of the month and i dont think its unfair for me to say we were very close we might have had two or three more medals
7363687 if the plan that i have is agreed by management and they are going to be supportive of it then we can move forward if they think it is the wrong plan and they are not supportive of it then i need to know and we can move in a different direction
7363688 this is a super tanker i think weve turned it were sailing into better waters but we have to keep that effort going
7363689 instead of people gathering to develop a culture they want to escape from other people individuals believe they can reach a level of self sufficiency that can isolate them or their family in an ideal place then they somehow expect the civilisation that has made them to serve them its a parasitic kind of life
7363690 it was not a community for communitys sake eating tofu and giving each other back rubs
7363691 it was the opposite of the hippy scene a community of construction workers if you were going to be here you were going to work harder than youd ever worked in your life
7363692 paolo was central to everything he was an unbelievably dynamic speaker everywhere he went his energy was obvious through word of mouth a steady stream of people came we had to send people away in the end the kitchen couldnt cook more than 1 000 meals a day
7363693 i was driven by emotions i never sat down and said what am i going to do now i was too busy
7363694 utopia is a pretty stupid notion it says if any group anywhere develops some ideal condition this condition is legitimate and i say forget it if you are surrounded by all sorts of demeaning or painful conditions then utopia is just an arrogant notion that has no room for evolution
7363695 we have this unstoppable energetic self righteous drive thats innate in us but which has been reoriented by limitless consumption per se it doesnt have anything evil about it its a hindrance but multiply that hindrance by billions and youve got catastrophe
7363696 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7363697 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7363698 it was a good effort but all credit to darren
7363699 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance as everybody knows its about winning ive no complaints ive not played well enough but theres one more event and ill certainly be giving it 101
7363700 a little bit frustrating because im playing well but cant score well at the moment gleneagles is my last chance ive just got to play my game i cant do anything about the other guys
7363701 we need to sit down with the olympic governing bodies and work through where we anticipate where we could be in 2012 but theres no athlete or sport that is not coming back inspired and wanting to raise the sights and asking how can we do better
7363702 it will be a tough ask to keep pace with the chinese or the americans but we have been right there with the russians and i think most of us are really going to be inspired to beat them in 2012 there is a possibility to finish third but we need to review the position before we make a firm commitment
7363703 we need a four year funding programme in place now to allow the olympic governing bodies to contract coaches and performance directors at the high market rate many of them demand
7363704 i would very much like to hear the prime minister underwrite the funding programme i know that they are minded to look at that and be supportive of the team but i hope that as soon as possible the government will be in a position to back the athletes
7363705 the question of prize money is under consideration we are aware that the americans do it and the australians do it but if we do go down this road we will look at the possibility of prize money for coaches as well as athletes
7363706 i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it
7363707 icc backed us on this matter to the hilt and without indias support we would not have fought until this time but australia have not toured us for 10 years and they have negative perceptions about pakistan how can that be removed unless they tour
7363708 had the tournament been relocated it would have snatched our rights to host the event but postponement has kept the trophy with us
7363709 in a way the postponement is a victory for us we are confident that the situation will get better we are sure that the tournament will be held in pakistan next year
7363710 all the players i know personally from other countries have expressed their concerns in terms of safety and security it was good that the decision to tour has been taken out of our players hands over the last couple of weeks it has been a huge topic of conversation in the dressing room cricket can now take priority again
7363711 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in however there was also a realisation that some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7363712 and ill be on my bike going for a ride because thats my passion i enjoy my job
7363713 ive been training 14 years to get to this point and theres no let up now
7363714 every session i do is aimed towards 2012 and it cant be taken as a stroll
7363715 the programme was designed to dispel the myths and mystique that surround competing in the olympic games
7363716 theyve all had the opportunity to go to macau for three days and come up here for two days and see their own sport inside their own venues during the competition phase i believe well see a very high retention factor from that group of individuals pushing to be in the team for london 2012
7363717 i relate it back to my era when i dived for australia and to be honest we were rubbish in sports generally
7363718 we never won a gold medal which was how the australian institute of sport was formed
7363719 if youd asked me what i thought when i walked in the door of british diving nine years ago id have said nobodys got any confidence or self belief thats one of the biggest changes in british sport and i like what im hearing about 2012 people are talking about the legacy its no good building all this up for london and having a great games and then four years later it just falls apart so the infrastructure will be important there has to be life after 2012 as well
7363720 were competing against countries that have very good facilities and often were struggling
7363721 its an absolute nightmare sometimes what i want is the funding to be able to concentrate full time on the athletes that im trying to get success for
7363722 the fact that weve done well in my area ensures the local authority is making room for diving in the new pool but the dry land centre that were looking at putting in is extremely elitist
7363723 theyve said theyll put a facility in but its not quite big enough in my view uk sport needs to say right if local government is putting money into this well throw in half a million or even 250 000 to make sure that its got the stuff an elite centre needs so far they havent done that and thats what pisses me off these are the things we need if we want to try and compete with the world
7363724 in terms of needing a new challenge or a new goal
7363725 but without the funding without the security of knowing that everything is in place for the next four years there will be serious problems its not just the riders who are the best in the world its the support staff too if they can guarantee the funding to keep us together as a winning team that will be a huge step
7363726 it let me know that hes human and its up for grabs
7363727 i hope for his sake that hes working in the gym because i will be
7363728 first and foremost there is a spiritual basis for this initiative to introduce italian nuns to the world nuns that belong to many different orders of the catholic church who have devoted their lives to the vows of poverty chastity and obedience
7363729 the criteria is clearly related to the internal beauty of the nun the spiritual beauty how they carry out their pastoral work both in the parish and when they are out teaching
7363730 another criteria while not fundamental to the competition but also important will be their visual appeal so part of the criteria for entry is that they be only between 18 and 40

7363732 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting
7363733 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
7363734 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour

7363736 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
7363737 it supports our argument that these certificates should be rolled out to all buildings because without the label nobody is going to do anything about it
7363738 our rating for eland house tells us we must clearly do better to make a difference to our energy performance
7363739 we are now acting on recommendations from our advisory report to help us improve future ratings
7363740 we would like to send out an appeal for calm where individuals have frictions between them we would ask them to work with the police and with other agencies instead of young people sadly losing their lives a man who was a son a brother and a friend has been lost and clearly that should be enough to make people think this is a crime that should not continue to occur we are aware there are tensions between rival gangs in the community and are alive to that issue and are working with the city council to enable young people to come together to resolve their differences
7363741 i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this
7363742 he was caring and laid back and he had a very close family he was a family boy the people who have done this can run but they cant hide and hopefully justice will be done
7363743 theres just not enough policing in the area we need more officers on the beat
7363744 you only have to go to the shops to see people dealing on the corner shootings and stabbings are a regular occurrence round here people need to get out of this area because its getting worse we definitely need more policing people are afraid to go out at night and only come out of their houses at times like this on a sunday morning
7363745 the grenade was launched into a crowd of people at the wedding ceremony
7363746 my songs have slowed down a little bit my new record is taking longer because of her but i say all of this happily
7363747 while i cant maybe produce as much music while im caring for her she doesnt just take my energy she gives it all back
7363748 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7363749 we strongly suspect that the missing are on the lower reaches of the glacier underneath the lumps of serac pillar of ice which means we cant really do anything
7363750 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7363751 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7363752 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7363753 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7363754 i wasnt completely submerged i was able to help the others
7363755 you know its the mountain its like an accident on the road this isnt the first and it wont be the last
7363756 after all so many of them were in jail for things they actually had nothing to do with many were convicted by signing false statements under torture or under the flimsiest of evidence and were locked away for years
7363757 prisoners cant get jobs because of their convictions or even insurance or loans in some cases they cant get into countries like the us canada or australia so if they can wipe their record clean by proving that the convictions against them were unjust and flawed why not
7363758 but no similar mechanism to explore all the wrong doings that went on in the barracks and police stations
7363759 most of the loyalist prisoners just think its time to get on with their lives now that the conflict is over unlike republicans who want to prove a point about the state and its role in the troubles the loyalists are just happy to be free and living their lives again
7363760 in fact the government is trying to target us they killed sheikh aziz and scores of innocent people
7363761 russia has no right to establish checkpoints in georgia the ceasefire agreement is the only agreement that is still alive all others are broken
7363762 georgia considers this as a continuation of occupation they have just changed their helmets georgia will continue to observe the ceasefire and launch international diplomatic initiatives to force russia to keep its word
7363763 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7363764 dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead i had to keep giving her the sad news over and over again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7363765 it was pretty obvious when i last saw her in november 2005 that she was pretty off the map so to speak but like with reagan people give former heads of state some dignity because of the stigma attached
7363766 we know she has had small strokes and these lead to memory loss you can still have a conversation with her about contemporary politics dementia is a very emotive word which conjures up a very particular image in conversation thatcher may need a bit of occasional reminding but then so do we all
7363767 can you honestly think of a way that just 2 a month could do more good for good
7363768 how many times have you heard an appeal for the homeless or the hungry well what about those who arent homeless or hungry dont they deserve charity too simon is a merchant banker he owns a villa in the south of france simon is rich what do you do when you see a rich person do you turn the other way do you feel sick inside people like simon dont want your pity they want your money without enormous sums of money their lives are not worth living so please send any amount however large to help the loaded po box 4 zurich switzerland thank you
7363769 countries like finland are often cited for their all through schools which provide one seamless education for children through primary and secondary age
7363770 there are obvious benefits to this style of education and in ashington we can bring that continuity while making use of existing school sites with the option of building extra new facilities where needed
7363771 this is another innovative development in the academy programme that will drive up standards of education for local children this isnt invention for its own sake weve looked at what needs to happen in ashington and developed a model that answers that need
7363772 we have done research which shows that the jury is still out on city academies you need five years to be able to evaluate the progress these schools are making and it is too early to judge whether they should be rolled out to effectively replace state school education
7363773 primary schools are smaller than secondary schools and really do depend on a relationship between each other which would make this a really damaging leap in the dark for the academies programme
7363774 does a political party have a convincing programme of policies
7363775 would this party leader be the kind of person you would like to have round for a beer at the family barbecue
7363776 of course youre worried i understand how you feel we feel it too i know its not fair it shouldnt be like this
7363777 the free market economy is the fairest way of rewarding people for their efforts
7363778 well give every parent the right to take money currently allocated to their childrens education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities
7363779 the big question is not what will government do but what will society do not so much what will i do but what will you do
7363780 its nothing to do with me im just the boss
7363781 i think it might be time for something from time
7363782 theres no room for any knockers on todays elaine page on sunday
7363783 oh yes we like a bit of that on this show
7363784 they want to see it but they dont want to talk about it
7363785 get out the posh china and put on a right hairy tea
7363786 a sequence of editing was mistakenly broadcast in the wrong order on some bbc news bulletins
7363787 after the event pictures showing the athletes intense frustration were sent to the news desk without time coding and were mistakenly edited into the report while this did not alter the editorial direction of our reports we regret that these pictures were not shown in chronological order in the sports coverage of the event shots were shown in the correct order
7363788 thankfully its human beings that make tv and human beings that watch them and human beings are illogical irrational and unfair
7363789 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7363790 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7363791 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale
7363792 whatever the bbc says and does it will get it in the neck
7363793 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7363794 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7363795 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under
7363796 going to begin to pretend how the economics of this would work
7363797 please go cockahoop for the finalists from last choir standing
7363798 its not how fast you can run its how quickly you can get the baton round
7363799 lack of movement amongst the mainly white commissioning executives at the bbc and channel 4
7363800 its easy to see why people tell me they feel theres a magic circle when it comes to the top jobs on our industry if the opportunities are so limited for white executives what chance do minorities have
7363801 even something like playing a computer game is valuable the subconscious goes to sleep and when it wakes up it panics the point of procrastination is to get the subconscious thinking
7363802 hopefully i will get all that stuff into the bloodstream and use it later
7363803 writing is rewriting the first draft is not important it is something to work on
7363804 the two ronnies had more words for breasts than eskimos have for snow
7363805 when you are cutting good stuff it means you are on the right track
7363806 it is about treating disabled people terribly but in such a way that no one can be offended
7363807 the way of writing sitcoms is to think of these set pieces first
7363808 writing with a partner is paid socialising writing on your own is work
7363809 the majority of those named on the list although they are living in the bliss and security of the diaspora and the anonymity of cyberspace their family members will not be so lucky
7363810 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7363811 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7363812 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7363813 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7363814 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7363815 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7363816 and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7363817 weight loss and well defined abdominal muscles and was an effective alternative to regular exercise
7363818 these were men who had been sentenced and found guilty by the supreme court walking around freely
7363819 it was evening around the time for the last prayer when armed men came and took my son islamuddin by force i have eyewitness statements from nine people that he was there from that night until now my son has never been seen
7363820 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 meters away and in front of these witnesses raped her
7363821 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally
7363822 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like
7363823 countries like finland are often cited for their all through schools which provide one seamless education for children through primary and secondary age
7363824 there are obvious benefits to this style of education and in ashington we can bring that continuity while making use of existing school sites with the option of building extra new facilities where needed
7363825 this is another innovative development in the academy programme that will drive up standards of education for local children this isnt invention for its own sake weve looked at what needs to happen in ashington and developed a model that answers that need
7363826 we have done research which shows that the jury is still out on city academies you need five years to be able to evaluate the progress these schools are making and it is too early to judge whether they should be rolled out to effectively replace state school education
7363827 primary schools are smaller than secondary schools and really do depend on a relationship between each other which would make this a really damaging leap in the dark for the academies programme
7363828 to the industrial revolution what cathedrals were to the medieval world
7363829 one tower went down perfectly the second only came down partially a third of it was left standing not exactly what we hoped for there were rumours they hit the motorway but when the dust cleared the highways agency said there was absolutely no debris on the nearby m1 motorway one of our teams chipped away at the concrete where it had become stuck and it finally came down at 5 30am
7363830 few people have been inside a cooling tower its such a vast amazing space
7363831 we really saw this as an opportunity for sheffield at times we really thought it might happen
7363832 i just think its unbelievable that these incredibly potent structures are being destroyed were so slow to realise the potential of these things theres nowhere in britain where a person driving can get so close to structures like this its tragic
7363833 it was the culmination of so much debate we did a survey into peoples attitudes and theres no question that everyone looked to them as a landmark some people love them and some hate them one woman said they were like marmite there were no camps on one side or the other yesterday everyone was just together
7363834 a combination of british energy and centrica solves the problems facing both companies today together they can work out a joint venture with edf to build nuclear sites
7363835 a possible merger of centrica with british energy if terms could be agreed and all parties are fully supportive
7363836 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production
7363837 instead they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil dependent countries
7363838 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7363839 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7363840 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7363841 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7363842 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions
7363843 two out of the five big pharmaceutical companies are allegedly looking into their pricing and if they are prepared to go back and look at the cost of their drugs to make them more cost effective then i welcome that
7363844 countries like finland are often cited for their all through schools which provide one seamless education for children through primary and secondary age
7363845 there are obvious benefits to this style of education and in ashington we can bring that continuity while making use of existing school sites with the option of building extra new facilities where needed
7363846 this is another innovative development in the academy programme that will drive up standards of education for local children this isnt invention for its own sake weve looked at what needs to happen in ashington and developed a model that answers that need

7363848 primary schools are smaller than secondary schools and really do depend on a relationship between each other which would make this a really damaging leap in the dark for the academies programme
7363849 the main worry the mpc should have about the fall in sterling is whether it will have a significant positive impact on growth
7363850 there is worrying evidence that uk manufacturers are preferring to use the lower pound as cover to raise their prices and profit margins rather than to expand market share and production volumes
7363851 one of the most striking features of the last year is the way in which wage inflation has remained subdued despite the rise in headline inflation and despite the fall in the exchange rate
7363852 and with the labour market outlook worsening markedly there is no reason to expect the latest fall in sterling to generate any second round inflationary consequences that would concern the mpc
7363853 when you talk to the policy strategists at hmrc they say the regime is benign and all their staff follow the rules but we find ordinary taxpayers have a very different experience on the ground
7363854 these are hugely draconian proposals that would allow the treasury to unjustly enrich itself at the expense of individual taxpayers the banks have been criticised for their unfair charges but if the banks shouldnt operate in this way why should hmrc
7363855 permitting hmrc to issue daily fines without authorisation from the general or special commissioners would remove a vital legal protection for taxpayers against the arbitrary use of power regardless of whether taxpayers could appeal the balance is shifted firmly in hmrcs favour and would inevitably result in greater use of daily fines
7363856 it all depends on market conditions and it is in the governments gift to decide when to sell it
7363857 we have witnessed a change in the way people use read and keep the time
7363858 and the company feels it is time for a change
7363859 creates uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7363860 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run from the scene
7363861 to my darling will miss your smile so much rip babe love you always
7363862 i will never forget you you will always be there in my memories in my heart
7363863 ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all
7363864 part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
7363865 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards
7363866 therefore much of the money raised should be used to kickstart a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor
7363867 a number of locations in the wolverhampton city centre area have been secured for forensic examination
7363868 eight members of the 2nd royal regiment of fusiliers have provided positive samples as part of the armys compulsory drug testing programme
7363869 the army treats drug taking very seriously and appropriate action is being taken against all eight soldiers
7363870 a break up will do nothing to accelerate the delivery of that i think baa is focused on the issue
7363871 thats a big stick but at the moment its all carrot with baa
7363872 i believe the government recognises the importance to the uk of an efficient hub airport and a third runway
7363873 i believe there was a weak economic case for building a second runway at stansted but a strong case for heathrow
7363874 like criticising british energy for not building new nuclear power stations in the 1990s politically it was not going to happen
7363875 it supports our argument that these certificates should be rolled out to all buildings because without the label nobody is going to do anything about it
7363876 our rating for eland house tells us we must clearly do better to make a difference to our energy performance
7363877 we are now acting on recommendations from our advisory report to help us improve future ratings
7363878 we want to encourage competitive sports in schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years
7363879 in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of sports are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7363880 correct the tragic mistake of reducing the competitive element in school sports
7363881 she was not happy to settle for a silver she went full throttle for the gold i think that is the spirit we want to encourage in our schools
7363882 today is handover day at the olympics and people are going to be looking at what were going to be doing in the next few years as london becomes the olympic city
7363883 we want our olympic legacy to be more than that to be about extending opportunity for sport extend it in schools giving children the opportunity to do sports they have never done before so that the next 10 years becomes a decade of sporting success for this country
7363884 we are prepared to put the money in even in these difficult economic times
7363885 it will inspire fitness and help tackle obesity the olympics can inspire people more people will give up smoking less people will become obese london will be different from beijing but they have set a very high standard
7363886 by 2012 there will be a generation of children inspired by our heroes in beijing weve now got 19 gold medals this is a new opportunity to follow in their footsteps
7363887 i think london will put on a great show something quite different to beijing
7363888 i wanted the children to see it and learn something
7363889 beijing was great but i think that england will do ok actually i think it will be better
7363890 it would be good if he tripped up on the carpet now
7363891 any city has their own twist on the games but with the olympic movement its all about bringing the world together as one the big thing is having a place something thats different and seeing how they welcome people from all over the world
7363892 it was pretty cool standing outside buckingham palace watching the guards some of the partygoers had their own ideas about the peculiarly british twist but london could put on the event
7363893 they need to sort that out in four years time
7363894 still we did think that they could introduce queueing and whingeing as olympic events in 2012
7363895 does a political party have a convincing programme of policies
7363896 would this party leader be the kind of person you would like to have round for a beer at the family barbecue
7363897 of course youre worried i understand how you feel we feel it too i know its not fair it shouldnt be like this
7363898 the free market economy is the fairest way of rewarding people for their efforts
7363899 well give every parent the right to take money currently allocated to their childrens education and then deploy it in accordance with their priorities
7363900 the big question is not what will government do but what will society do not so much what will i do but what will you do
7363901 its nothing to do with me im just the boss
7363902 there are some more general broader rights for which a charter is the more suitable instrument
7363903 for example you have the right to be believed in anything you tell the revenue authorities unless there is evidence that what you are saying is not true the revenue authorities should collect the right amount of tax not necessarily the maximum amount of tax which could be levied you have the right to be represented at a meeting with the revenue authorities by a person of your choice
7363904 a sequence of editing was mistakenly broadcast in the wrong order on some bbc news bulletins
7363905 after the event pictures showing the athletes intense frustration were sent to the news desk without time coding and were mistakenly edited into the report while this did not alter the editorial direction of our reports we regret that these pictures were not shown in chronological order in the sports coverage of the event shots were shown in the correct order
7363906 thankfully its human beings that make tv and human beings that watch them and human beings are illogical irrational and unfair
7363907 it all depends on market conditions and it is in the governments gift to decide when to sell it
7363908 he may be my father but he will never be my dad
7363909 the situation i was in and the pressure i was under was enormous
7363910 if you have a family like mine a large tribe they all want to impose their opinion on you i am the eldest son so it was very difficult for me to do what i wanted to do father mother and brothers come first for us and we experienced a lot of difficulties in iraq over the years wars we had to move house and i was without work for a while
7363911 but these are excuses and children do not do excuses
7363912 all these girls are up for it they really want success
7363913 shelley rudman was a hurdler before she tried the bob and look at rebecca romero an olympic medal in rowing and now a gold in cycling
7363914 its a great chance to see if ive got the skills
7363915 and i had a dismally overpriced and atrociously served dinner at the uber hip buddha bar
7363916 i then spent a quarter of an hour eating a cheese and pickle sandwich wondering if i was obsessed with food
7363917 there arent many french women who were famous the world over who defined their era represented the image of their country moved among the greats of this world and lived a life full of twists and turns drama and big love affairs
7363918 while waiting to watch the life of carla bruni sarkozy or catherine deneuve producers are going crazy for coco chanel
7363919 coco chanel is a very important woman for the french
7363920 she was a woman who liberated other women she gave them power a very feminine kind of power
7363921 it represents a new state of mind in france in which the lives of celebrities have become just as interesting as those of fictional characters celebrity has become the modern religion
7363922 we now have a president who divorced and remarried a supermodel
7363923 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a heeler hes going to be
7363924 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7363925 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7363926 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7363927 well end up blundering into cities plastered with the equivalent of flash banners and microsites
7363928 technologists are busying themselves informatics whether physically or via various forms of augmented reality its all really exciting thoughtful stuff with tons of thrilling prototypes and sketches it reminds me of early webiness because unless im missing something theres not a lot of sophisticated thinking about how this intersects with commerce marketing and advertising and im very willing to believe im missing something this is why this is a bit of a voyage of discovery and i just noticed today that adam greenfields talking about it here the city is already festooned with persuasion screens are already talking to phones and animating transport systems but its not being done by thoughtful ui experts its being done by poster contractors at the behest of advertising agencies
7363929 is there some connection to the admittedly unformed notion of
7363930 immediately he rose took up the bed and went out in the presence of them all so that all were amazed and glorified god saying
7363931 there was no longer room to receive them not even near the door
7363932 its marvellous shes made it to 50 now and shes still going as long as she keeps on doing the shows well keep on coming i cant believe that shes only playing in cardiff and london out of everywhere in the uk im really pleased about it its good to have wales recognised
7363933 shes got the physique the music to us at 52 shes an inspiration to go on at the other end of the age scale nine year old i think shes really good and id like to be like her
7363934 victory parade for team gb but funding may be cut
7363935 quantum teleportation allows for a particle to be percieved to be in two places at the same time
7363936 the few kids ive talked to say theyre ready to come back to school
7363937 they miss their friends theyre ready to meet their new teachers and take their new classes
7363938 i try to get ready mentally because its especially the first week of school a real big challenge
7363939 we were kicking in doors what i saw was a lot of innocent people being hurt in this war a lot of innocent people dead
7363940 a silent but all reaching coup is taking place within the united states this coup is not being directed by bomb laden muslim terrorists nor will it ever be covered by the mainstream media the seditious act is being carried out by our very own elected officials with president bush leading the insurrection
7363941 a few days and we all go home if we can just make it the net few we will be on our way

7363946 when the issue of qualified affected voting was brought to my attention several months ago i was interested in knowing more about it i had always been concerned with what i perceive as a conflict of interest when s a g members who make their living as producers with active production companies are allowed to vote on s a g contracts but after taking a considerable amount of time vetting the issue i came to the conclusion that qualified affected voting would not be appropriate for s a g members given the ups and downs of the actors life to disenfranchise so many just to exclude so few is not fair and would diminish the strength of our union this is one of the reasons i fully support martin sheens august 21st letter to the membership

7363976 has got nothing to do with the situation i was in
7363977 its got nothing to do with him if we lost two games
7363978 if a player didnt want to play for me i know what id do
7363979 id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go just to get rid of him i had a player two years ago when i got my job who i heard had been speaking to another club and i just sold him and said off you go and he went ok and off he popped i wouldnt try too hard to talk a player out of moving
7363980 those teams dont get about us like english teams do
7363981 teams like roma will let you play but against teams who show grit and determination roll their sleeves up and battle against you its a different kettle of fish we got a bit excited when we started beating teams 5 0 and 3 0 and weve come back to reality with a bump
7363982 i have a big point to prove after the way i finished at liverpool
7363983 i think i can do really well in the premier league it suits the way i play im made for england
7363984 well have to put a good performance on when we go to chelsea
7363985 because theyll wipe the floor with us if we dont
7363986 the boys had signalled to me minutes earlier to try and get garry off before it got any worse
7363987 fortunately it was only a dead leg and he was able to jump at the back post for the goal it was a very very good performance from quincy and the fans took to him hes exciting hes not only quick he does have a wee trick he doesnt run up blind alleys he can see pictures and he can only get better
7363988 i know that the players know that and the fans know that
7363989 i never took my eyes off the ball for a second
7363990 ive committed myself ive gone for the ball unfortunately the collisions ended with the keeper coming off worst but there was no malice in it
7363991 they played at a tempo that was too much for us
7363992 hes technically good with two strong feet and a scrapper throwing his body in to block shots weve lacked that
7363993 it the goal should have stood and it has cost us two points
7363994 in the last couple of weeks all we have heard is that the old firm get every decision going well today shows that isnt the case it never has been i just hope referees and officials are not bowing to the pressure
7363995 it was a clear handball but the referee did not give it he is obviously a celtic fan i was so angry i could have knocked the referee out lets have a look at him and his refereeing
7363996 obviously pauls not very happy but its not just one persons responsibility the crowds reaction was justified but promotion is the goal and i dont see why we cant turn it around
7363997 there will always be times in a game even physical games where you can play football
7363998 ive never been north but im at chelsea for two seasons so i must get used to bolton manchester united manchester city
7363999 what i expected i saw today it was difficult winning 1 0 away from home in england is the same as winning 10 0 elsewhere wigan played better than portsmouth and had players who are healthy have power and pressured us i know we didnt play as well as we did last week but i understand the reasons why
7364000 it didnt matter who took them they kept doing the same frigging thing
7364001 theyve had a bad day but the piece of brilliance in the game came from deco if it wasnt him it might have been from nicolas anelka if not him joe cole florent malouda theyve got a string of talent and how do you compete to think that we used to mock rangers and celtic being so dominant in scotland didnt we

7364025 my entire career depends on me getting off this list
7364026 i probably wont be able to get a job anywhere else in the world having this mark that im on this list
7364027 it is quite clear when the government does something that takes away not just your job but your occupation your career they have to provide you with some means to clear your name
7364028 i have no idea why i am on the list and theyre not telling officially that im even on the list
7364029 unfortunately it is a problem that is shared by countless individuals who have no connection to terrorism have no connection to crime and dont belong on this list
7364030 the problem with what the government is doing is that they really dont care about innocent casualties
7364031 we served in a war and theyre thumbing their noses at us basically and that makes me feel really sad about this situation

7364036 and ill be on my bike going for a ride because thats my passion i enjoy my job
7364037 ive been training 14 years to get to this point and theres no let up now
7364038 every session i do is aimed towards 2012 and it cant be taken as a stroll
7364039 the programme was designed to dispel the myths and mystique that surround competing in the olympic games
7364040 theyve all had the opportunity to go to macau for three days and come up here for two days and see their own sport inside their own venues during the competition phase i believe well see a very high retention factor from that group of individuals pushing to be in the team for london 2012
7364041 i relate it back to my era when i dived for australia and to be honest we were rubbish in sports generally
7364042 we never won a gold medal which was how the australian institute of sport was formed
7364043 if youd asked me what i thought when i walked in the door of british diving nine years ago id have said nobodys got any confidence or self belief thats one of the biggest changes in british sport and i like what im hearing about 2012 people are talking about the legacy its no good building all this up for london and having a great games and then four years later it just falls apart so the infrastructure will be important there has to be life after 2012 as well
7364044 were competing against countries that have very good facilities and often were struggling
7364045 its an absolute nightmare sometimes what i want is the funding to be able to concentrate full time on the athletes that im trying to get success for
7364046 the fact that weve done well in my area ensures the local authority is making room for diving in the new pool but the dry land centre that were looking at putting in is extremely elitist
7364047 theyve said theyll put a facility in but its not quite big enough in my view uk sport needs to say right if local government is putting money into this well throw in half a million or even 250 000 to make sure that its got the stuff an elite centre needs so far they havent done that and thats what pisses me off these are the things we need if we want to try and compete with the world
7364048 in terms of needing a new challenge or a new goal
7364049 but without the funding without the security of knowing that everything is in place for the next four years there will be serious problems its not just the riders who are the best in the world its the support staff too if they can guarantee the funding to keep us together as a winning team that will be a huge step
7364050 it let me know that hes human and its up for grabs
7364051 i hope for his sake that hes working in the gym because i will be

7364054 i think jacques rogges forgotten its supposed to be enjoyable
7364055 come on jacques its only sport its a bit of fun
7364056 all i know is its important to enjoy it think too much and you start to worry
7364057 prosecute all alleged criminal and civil law violations that are backed by sufficient evidence
7364058 its not nice to see those things its supposed to be a celebration right
7364059 i feel like i was extremely justified to do what i did
7364060 i needed to do it and thats the way it went
7364061 lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it and thats it i feel like the score is even and it just cost him more than it cost me at the time and thats the way it is
7364062 kyle had the fastest car on the long runs all night
7364063 my only chance to get him was on the restarts
7364064 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
7364065 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me
7364066 just smoked the back bumper of my car and sent me up the race track
7364067 afterward he said sorry man my car was just faster
7364068 so in my mind i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens
7364069 thats the way it went and thats the decision i made

7364087 i believe the government recognises the importance to the uk of an efficient hub airport and a third runway
7364088 i believe there was a weak economic case for building a second runway at stansted but a strong case for heathrow
7364089 like criticising british energy for not building new nuclear power stations in the 1990s politically it was not going to happen
7364090 whilst the current level of bookings for summer 2008 is in line with forecasts the signs for 2009 are less clear cut

7364108 sitting back obviously when the crowd was roaring for robert was a really difficult task for the opposition i would imagine it is a powerful effect on teams theres no doubt about that
7364109 pada hari itu 15 ogos saya saya diarahkan oleh orang atasan saya untuk menjadi saksi sumpah saiful bukhari saya antara empat orang imam yang diarahkan untuk menjadi saksi
7364110 sumpah itu bukan saya yang aturkan teksnya disediakan oleh peguamnya atau mungkin ada orang lain yang buat itu
7364111 apabila dia saiful membacakan teks dia seolah olah tidak merasa bersalah
7364112 kalau kita seorang islam yang beriman kalau kita nak bersumpah ini kita akan takut apa akan terjadi tetapi kerana teks ucapan yang dibacakan itu dia tak rasa bersalah
7364113 sepatutnya dia sebut 26 jun tetapi dia sebut 28 ogos
7364114 saya rasa para pengundi di permatang pauh mungkin ada yang mengenali saya jadi saya berharap jangan saya dipersalahkan boleh tak

7364118 welcome to the website and forum you can see from the distinctly nonprofessional look that this is not a pac political action committee not a professional political organization not yet anyway no what this is is a place for other angry pissed off hillary voters just like you and i to come and think talk discuss and then mobilize for november created by a lowly hillary clinton campaign precinct captain and county and state delegate from a small central neighborhood in las vegas with no other connection with the campaign whatsoever other than that first i was going to vote for mccain out of spite then i thought i could that we all could merely write in hillary in november and because she had more popular votes could then decimate both obama and mccain then i found out that my own state nevada does not allow write in candidates and that this is true of many states and many other states have limitations on write in candidates like limiting to those who didnt lose the primary absolutely absurd ridiculous limitations that have effectively throttled and destroyed true democracy in the us so coming to this point has been a long journey and here is what ive based my own personal november decision on if you agree join us

7364123 c tanta delusione perch i ragazzi hanno fatto bene soprattutto nel secondo tempo i rigori purtroppo sono andati male complimenti allinter sono due squadre che hanno onorato il calcio e noi volevamo vincere questa coppa per il presidente che per so che sar soddisfatto lo stesso di questi ragazzi lerrore di totti anche i grandi campioni possono sbagliare adesso dobbiamo pensare a domenica e stasera abbiamo avuto la conferma che questo gruppo far delle cose interessanti
7364124 non dimentichiamo che abbiamo a disposizione una grande squadra e soprattutto non dimentichiamo la vicenda mutu che ci ha spiazzati oltre a riise abbiamo preso anche baptista e qualcosaltro arriver sicuramente
7364125 abbiamo fatto vedere delle buone cose ma purtroppo non sono bastate per vincere
7364126 dopo il loro vantaggio non abbiamo mollato il secondo gol si poteva evitare ma comunque abbiamo reagito bene
7364127 non semplice adattarsi ad un nuovo tipo di gioco ad un campionato cos difficile come quello italiano per ha fatto bene anche lui
7364128 the ends justifies any means since we alone know the greater good
7364129 el h bito de describir exhaustivamente una enfermedad social y luego ponerle la correspondiente droga
7364130 la ense anza y el diagn stico de la muerte
7364131 la muerte esa compa era familiar desaparece del lenguaje y su nombre se vuelve prohibido
7364132 la descomposici n del esp ritu cient fico hoy en d a acabada comenz cuando su poder de separaci n convertido en operacional posibilit cuando los medios de investigaci n y de acci n dejaron bien atr s a los medios de representaci n y de comprensi n la destrucci n del mundo sin comprenderlo y desde entonces la arruinada totalidad lleva una existencia fantasmag rica en las especulaciones cosmog nicas arbitrarias de los f sicos que ya no son sino pobres metaf sicos como esos adoradores de los cuantos que gravemente se preguntan
7364133 la parcelaci n m dica es cuando menos muy c moda
7364134 en este autocrecimiento la t cnica hace un llamamiento a la t cnica en su desarrollo plantea problemas eminentemente t cnicos que por eso mismo no pueden ser resueltos m s que por la t cnica
7364135 todo lo que esta medicina se esfuerza en sanar se agrava y tal aceleraci n exige la multiplicaci n de m dicos hospitales industrias farmac uticas y el presupuesto de las naciones
7364136 si hasta en sectores cient ficos reina un esp ritu indisciplinado y un desbarajuste en lo que ha de admitirse como cierto nada tiene de particular que en el naturismo donde cualquiera se erige en doctor el desconcierto en las ideas ofrezca caracteres alarmantes
7364137 se exagera tambi n la eficacia de la vida natural en la curaci n de las enfermedades ya que se llama vida natural a cualquier cosa y muchas veces especialmente en las grandes urbes y por gentes que viven de un salario todo suele reducirse a un rigor vegetariano en la alimentaci n
7364138 por mi parte no hab a llegado nunca a manifestarme contra el dogma microbiano pero hace mucho tiempo que no me satisfac a
7364139 los g rmenes microbianos no deben ser mirados como causa sino como efecto de la enfermedad
7364140 tenemos que reaccionar m dicos y p blico contra este absurdo p nico que s lo estragos ha producido hasta la fecha
7364141 la medicina se ha metido en una falsa ruta al pretender curar una enfermedad combatiendo solamente al microbio y sin tratar de reparar en el organismo atacado el trastorno bioqu mico primordial
7364142 el m dico si hemos de juzgar por el modo como hoy ejerce su profesi n no responde a su prestigio l rico de esp ritu comprensivo y hermano del que sufre
7364143 la medicina ni como instituci n ni como colectividad cumple con su papel de prevenir la enfermedad cultivar y hacer respetar la salud y laborar por el perfeccionamiento y el bienestar del hombre
7364144 reaccionando algo contra la microbioman a que conced a una importancia exclusiva al microbio en las enfermedades hoy se tiende a aceptar que el despertar como la marcha de las enfermedades depende de dos factores del microbio y de nuestro organismo entre la medicina social y el naturismo hay siempre esta pugna interminable
7364145 el declive de la ciencia en la era de la manipulaci n gen tica

7364157 maka jika kalian berselisih dalam satu perkara kembalikanlah kepada allah taala dan rasul nya jika kalian beriman kepada allah taala dan hari akhir hal itu lebih baik serta lebih bagus akibatnya
7364158 jika mereka beriman seperti apa yang kalian beriman kepadanya maka sungguh mereka telah mendapat hidayah sedang jika mereka berpaling maka hanyalah mereka itu dalam kesengsaraan
7364159 contoh mudah saja ustadz hartono ahmad jaiz yang dikenal sebagai seorang salafi moderat dan aktif di yayasan al sofwa dikarenakan beliau mempunyai perhatian terhadap dunia politik sudah dijauhi dan dianggap sebagai sururi quthbi
7364160 ya allah ya rabbi setiap mereka abu ibrahim cs menyakiti ummat islam dengan segala cara yang mereka lakukan
7364161 definisi salafy ekstrem kurang lebih orang orang yang menyebut dirinya salafi pemangku paling absah manhaj salafus shalih tetapi kelakuannya sangat jauh dari akhlak dan adab salafus shalih
7364162 si fasid bin dhalal luqman baabduh itu juga mencela habis habisan safar hawali
7364163 abul fitan atau abu google pemilik blog fakta itu bisa dimeja hijaukan

7364165 100 pelajaran dari para pemimpin ikhwanul muslimin hal 105 robbani press jakarta 2001
7364166 luqman baabduh sendiri dalam buku mat mengkafirkan kaum muslimin khususnya daulah utsmaniyyah dan kaum muslimin mesir ya khawarij dulu juga seperti itu bahkan lebih terang terangan
7364167 tetapi lihatlah apakah mereka pernah merugikan orang kafir seperti itu tidak sama sekali
7364168 dia tidak tampak kontribusinya dalam mendakwahi orang orang hindu di bali
7364169 karenanya jihad bom bali adalah salah satu bentuk ukhuwah islamiyah baca ikhwaniyah peny
7364170 mereka mengikuti nabi nabi mereka muhammad maksudnya muhammad as sewed
7364171 mereka memiliki izzah yang sangat tinggi sekali mereka dikenal sebagai pemangku manhaj paling shahih yang paling berhak mengadili seluruh manusia selamanya mereka tidak mau kehilangan muka mereka tidak mau tunduk kepada kebenaran
7364172 ya aba zaid saya nasehatkan kepadamu jika nasehat ini berguna bagimu tinggalkan kelompok sesat khawarij itu mereka sangat berbahaya badi dunia dan akhiratmu sangat berbahaya bagi umat islam dan kehidupan manusia tinggalkanlah selagi engkau masih bisa meninggalkannya jika hatimu telah ditetapkan bersama kelompok mereka alangkah malangnya ibumu yang telah melahirkanmu atau ayahmu yang telah membesarkanmu dengan tetesan keringat dan kerja keras
7364173 demikian pertanyaan dari saya abu zaid abdurrahman wa insya allah jika anda tidak berkeberatan akan saya kirimkan beberapa cd rekaman ceramah ustadz muhammad umar as sewed kepada anda semoga bermanfaat tolong disebutkan alamat anda via pm baarakallaahufiikum
7364174 tidak usah tidak usah dikirim percuma saya sudah bara sama dia sebagaimana saya bara sama orang orang jil dan yang semisalnya mereka sama merusaknya terhadap islam dan kaum muslimin saya akan membela islam sekuat kesanggupanku termasuk seandainya untuk itu allah taala harus memanggiku ya rabbi maafkanlah aku untuk semua kesalahanku semoga semua ini menjadi kaffarat atas dosa dosaku kepada mu dan kepada ummat islam amin ya karim
7364175 s alafy ekstrem orang orang yang menunggangi nama salafus shalih untuk menghancurkan ajaran dan kehormatan salafus shalih itu sendiri mereka semuanya saja yang ghuluw dengan manhaj sesat itu tidak cuma ustadz bahkan syaikhnya sekalipun
7364176 bagaimanapun orang orang ini sangat bodoh ini juga ciri lain dari khawarij
7364177 ya kita semua sudah tahu bagaimana kelakuan orang orang khawarij yang mengatasnamakan salafi ini
7364178 sebenarnya saya sudah lama menyadari bahwa kalian itu lebih mewakili gambaran khawarij daripada imam samudra cs saya sudah lama mengetahui hal ini baru sekarang saja saya tampakkan secara terbuka
7364179 lalu bagaimana dengan para khawarij ini naudzubillah wa naudzubillah mereka benar benar telah sesat dari jalan lurus seluruh amal amal jihad yang dilakukan kaum muslimin di jaman ini meskipun sifatnya jihad defensif mereka kecam habis habisan dalam buku mat itu luqman baabduh mencela habis habisan jihad ummat islam perjuangan almarhum kartosoewiryo relawan kompak dewan dakwah di ambon komandan ibnul khattab di chechnya mujahidin afghanistan sampai sampai hamas syaikh yasin dst tidak selamat dari lidah api mereka
7364180 adapun para khawarij ini justru bermesraan memuji muji bahkan mendoakan regim sekuler yang sebenarnya tidak islami alasannya taat kepada ulil amri mungkin para khawarij di amerika sana juga menyerukan ketaatan murni kepada regim george bush
7364181 coba pikirkan ini ada orang bodoh dalam islam kemudian dia berdiri bersama2 orang kafir dalam memerangi yg mereka sebut sebagai
7364182 sebab apa lihat tuh maniac maniac salafy mereka bikin blog2 yang isinya fitnah kebohongan kehinaan kenajisan permusuhan de el el
7364183 sesungguhnya al banna hanyalah mengambil ide pan islamisme yang digulirkan al afghani
7364184 sebenarnya pan islamisme adalah kewajiban agama dan memiliki landasan yang kuat di dalam dan as sunnah
7364185 ini melibatkan dirinya dalam permusuhan yang lama dimana ia selalu memainkan dirinya sebagai penjahat daya tariknya sebagai politikus berpangkal dari keahliannya dalam memadukan dan memanipulasi antara agama dengan kekacauan kondisi antara kelompok konservatif dan kelompok radikal liberalis
7364186 abul fitan atau abu google pemilik blog fakta itu bisa dimeja hijaukan
7364187 ketika nabi pernah mengatakan kurang lebih begini jika kau di pukul bagian tubuhmu balas lah dengan memukul di bagian yg sama fair dan ketika ane temukan jasad pem fitnah ini yg memfitnah ane dan meresahkan keluarga ane hmmm urusannya sama sangkur poso
7364188 wah di hajr masih mending pak di hajar aja sekalian yang namanya penipu khan bisa dimasukin delik pidana tuh kita bawa aja tulisan tulisan yamani ini kemudian kita ajukan bantahannya kita seret ke pengadilan para yamani penipu ini

7364190 ada postingan salaf pada 03 mei 2006 14 07 17
7364191 tetapi imam syahid menyampaikan perintah rahasia rencana ini terlaksana dengan tepat dan polisi pun tidak mampu melarangnya
7364192 if you want me to play this weekend i think ill be able to
7364193 and ill stand with arms high and heart abandoned in awe to the one who gave it all
7364194 i want to lift my hands and just go to that place but what would my husband wife think
7364195 if i actually do what my heart is telling me the people around me are gonna look
7364196 oh well you know what take it from me you couldnt have cared for two babies at once anyway
7364197 the vote that is left to get is a vote that loves hillary clinton
7364198 they make less than 50 000 theyre catholics they live in small towns and rural america the places that bill clinton spent all his time campaigning and oh by the way they love bill clinton
7364199 are sitting out there loving the clintons not liking barack obama what has to happen between now and november to get that critical 11 percent to move into barack obamas column
7364200 its the bill clinton question i think that a lot of people are going to watch
7364201 youve got to assume hes going to say and do all the right things
7364202 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing

7364204 we want to encourage competitive sports in schools not the medals for all culture we have seen in previous years
7364205 in sport you get better by challenging yourself against other people a lot of sports are team games where people have to work together but they play against other teams
7364206 correct the tragic mistake of reducing the competitive element in school sports
7364207 she was not happy to settle for a silver she went full throttle for the gold i think that is the spirit we want to encourage in our schools
7364208 today is handover day at the olympics and people are going to be looking at what were going to be doing in the next few years as london becomes the olympic city
7364209 we want our olympic legacy to be more than that to be about extending opportunity for sport extend it in schools giving children the opportunity to do sports they have never done before so that the next 10 years becomes a decade of sporting success for this country
7364210 we are prepared to put the money in even in these difficult economic times
7364211 it will inspire fitness and help tackle obesity the olympics can inspire people more people will give up smoking less people will become obese london will be different from beijing but they have set a very high standard
7364212 by 2012 there will be a generation of children inspired by our heroes in beijing weve now got 19 gold medals this is a new opportunity to follow in their footsteps
7364213 countries like finland are often cited for their all through schools which provide one seamless education for children through primary and secondary age
7364214 there are obvious benefits to this style of education and in ashington we can bring that continuity while making use of existing school sites with the option of building extra new facilities where needed
7364215 this is another innovative development in the academy programme that will drive up standards of education for local children this isnt invention for its own sake weve looked at what needs to happen in ashington and developed a model that answers that need
7364216 we have done research which shows that the jury is still out on city academies you need five years to be able to evaluate the progress these schools are making and it is too early to judge whether they should be rolled out to effectively replace state school education
7364217 primary schools are smaller than secondary schools and really do depend on a relationship between each other which would make this a really damaging leap in the dark for the academies programme
7364218 general opinion in the party is in favor of parting ways
7364219 i see the parties on two different paths because the promises and the agreements are not being fulfilled
7364220 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7364221 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7364222 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7364223 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7364224 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7364225 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7364226 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7364227 ive never stumped before but i want to be a part of this
7364228 we are going to change the constitution and say on nov
7364229 were just polling yes or no not trying to find converts or change peoples minds
7364230 california should do more to encourage families to stay together
7364231 they want people to feel like you are a bad person if you support what has been the definition of marriage since the dawn of time
7364232 children in schools will be taught that same sex marriage is ok
7364233 im not a tough guy but i am pretty fucking nuts
7364234 please go cockahoop for the finalists from last choir standing
7364235 its not how fast you can run its how quickly you can get the baton round
7364236 to the industrial revolution what cathedrals were to the medieval world
7364237 one tower went down perfectly the second only came down partially a third of it was left standing not exactly what we hoped for there were rumours they hit the motorway but when the dust cleared the highways agency said there was absolutely no debris on the nearby m1 motorway one of our teams chipped away at the concrete where it had become stuck and it finally came down at 5 30am
7364238 few people have been inside a cooling tower its such a vast amazing space
7364239 we really saw this as an opportunity for sheffield at times we really thought it might happen
7364240 i just think its unbelievable that these incredibly potent structures are being destroyed were so slow to realise the potential of these things theres nowhere in britain where a person driving can get so close to structures like this its tragic
7364241 it was the culmination of so much debate we did a survey into peoples attitudes and theres no question that everyone looked to them as a landmark some people love them and some hate them one woman said they were like marmite there were no camps on one side or the other yesterday everyone was just together
7364242 instead of people gathering to develop a culture they want to escape from other people individuals believe they can reach a level of self sufficiency that can isolate them or their family in an ideal place then they somehow expect the civilisation that has made them to serve them its a parasitic kind of life
7364243 it was not a community for communitys sake eating tofu and giving each other back rubs
7364244 it was the opposite of the hippy scene a community of construction workers if you were going to be here you were going to work harder than youd ever worked in your life
7364245 paolo was central to everything he was an unbelievably dynamic speaker everywhere he went his energy was obvious through word of mouth a steady stream of people came we had to send people away in the end the kitchen couldnt cook more than 1 000 meals a day
7364246 i was driven by emotions i never sat down and said what am i going to do now i was too busy
7364247 utopia is a pretty stupid notion it says if any group anywhere develops some ideal condition this condition is legitimate and i say forget it if you are surrounded by all sorts of demeaning or painful conditions then utopia is just an arrogant notion that has no room for evolution
7364248 we have this unstoppable energetic self righteous drive thats innate in us but which has been reoriented by limitless consumption per se it doesnt have anything evil about it its a hindrance but multiply that hindrance by billions and youve got catastrophe
7364249 theres going to be a street party greenbank road will be closed and were going to attempt the worlds biggest glenfarg station jig up and down greenbank road
7364250 the hall has previously held 100 people on hogmanay so as long as we beat 100 people but being glenfarg and not wanting to do things by half were really looking for 200 people to really make it an event to remember
7364251 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7364252 bringing out the hardcover last year during the hectic lead in to the primaries didnt help the book because it was perceived by some to be a campaign tool its actually a fine and moving memoir
7364253 wed been holding off releasing the paperback until the election season was over when we felt people would be able to focus on the human story he is telling but clearly this is a new opportunity for the book and its a great way to get to know who this man is and what he stands for
7364254 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7364255 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7364256 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7364257 it was a pretty well behaved group and smaller than what we would have expected
7364258 im here to honor our son and the sacrifice he made for our country and to support the troops and the families who give so much
7364259 were very grateful to the white house and fema for the way theyve responded to this storm for people again regrettably this storm has killed 11 floridians and we need to stay focused
7364260 but whats the like point of school getting a job making money everything
7364261 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7364262 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
7364263 this is going to force them to make the ps3 last longer and theyre kind of positioning to do that
7364264 sony has no chance of making money on the ps3
7364265 ik realiseerde me waarom we reageren op het geluid van de golven het vallen van de regen de wind in de bomen omdat die geluiden niets betekenen ze herinneren ons aan een tijd heel vroeg in ons leven toen we de geluiden om ons heen niet begrepen maar ze enkel hoorden en daarom geven ze ons respijt van onze doorlopende pogingen om de wereld te veranderen door magische handelingen of eindeloze gedachten betekenisloze geluiden die ons troosten tijdens spannende acties het doorgronden van patronen tijdens de zoektocht naar begrip en verandering
7364266 i believe the third time will be the charm my first win fighting for the third time in germany and ill bring home my third world championship belt
7364267 i heard that valuev has been swimming to train for our fight
7364268 everything about training camp was good i worked very hard to get ready for this fight ive been working on a lot of stuff with manny like more balanced punching and a few new moves when we get into the ring i want him to be thinking about what hes going to do with me hes not going to fight the same guy he did the first time you cant let him stand there or hell throw punches all night long im going to take the fight to him and make him move around im going to stay on him surround him and show him different angles and more combination punching
7364269 im not muhammad ali said wilder who scored at least one more point
7364270 i feel like i can be in there with anybody and everybody at this weight 168 im enjoying boxing now ive put the lacy fight behind me i blew that one we wanted to get this fight out of the way first and now ill be calling out a lot of people id love to get biko if the offer is right if i have to fight guys like froch or pascal to get a world title fight i will i kept hitting this guy with rights and then got him with the big left i knew he was going to come out and bang with me but im too sharp for him i kind of got robbed of the knockout but im glad he didnt get hurt

7364274 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
7364275 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research
7364276 a single question can be more influential than a thousand statements
7364277 since a politician never believes what he says he is quite surprised to be taken at his word
7364278 i respect anybody that gets into that ring but i want to fight some name fighters
7364279 ill take anybody i want these up and coming fighters id like to fight derric rossy teke oruh alonzo butler chazz witherspoon or whoever
7364280 i was really disappointed she knew what the weight was months ago
7364281 i feel she really didnt want to or try to make the weight i saw her on tuesday and wednesday morning walking on the treadmill you arent going to lose weight walking
7364282 im not complaining about the decision but i would like to get that one one more time
7364283 if we got a little busier out there we could have pulled out the fight
7364284 i feel confident i feel if i can go into the gym and make those adjustments i will do well
7364285 yeah it was horrifying to see how so many people misunderstood the company
7364286 im writing a book about enron i need to see what the other guys are saying
7364287 its been disappointing for us because you know weve tried to get them to do things make security a lot more visible on campus but so far its you know the response has been quite disappointing
7364288 im not just going into this episode as a bushfire candidate but believe you me the bushfires are still a big issue in the community and needs to be addressed
7364289 the chief minister done the wrong thing with the communities over the bushfires and he needs to still come up with the answers here
7364290 the time is ripe theyre sick of the stanhope government theyre sick of the arrogance of majority government
7364291 anything you dedicate this amount of time when you see it accomplished it pulls at your heartstrings and it definitely has to mine
7364292 it is safe to walk through these doors everyone walks through these doors will know everyone here is here to serve them
7364293 a full four year programme must be in place to give our top coaches the high market rate many of them should command we cannot afford to lose any of them now we need to hire the best to come to britain
7364294 we need four years of funding in place for the national governing bodies so they can negotiate contracts to sign them up now for 2012 it cannot be done on a year by year basis
7364295 we would like to hear the prime minister underwrite the four year funding plan
7364296 im ambitious and its going to take something different and i would want to go on further in 2012
7364297 just so long as they are opposite sexes there would be trouble if they were both boys
7364298 if im going to be the next president of the united states
7364299 they say its now legal for transvestites to assault women in rest rooms they always go too far
7364300 he is not going to be beholden to anyone i think those values will translate here
7364301 if obamas core message is change and judgment based on his prescience on the iraq war vote well then biden is the exact opposite of those things but it should be fun having a real pitbull in the number two position to do some of the necessary dirty work
7364302 its easy to float on gossamers when the world is safe but when its burning down a guy like biden is just the ticket sure he talks a lot but he gets things done
7364303 how can joe biden run against a broken washington when hes such an integral figure in it hes been there since he was 29 years old
7364304 if you believe as i do that vp candidates matter most on three days the first day debate day and election day then the obama campaign has to be ecstatic about today one goal down two to go
7364305 hes not from our world hes kind of a blowhard and dislikes the blogs in other words hes perfect for the obama campaign reinforcing their key frame of change but not scary liberal change
7364306 id say it suggests a serious adult attitude toward the enormous burden that the next presidency will be especially in foreign policy
7364307 zooooooo op bridget uit the bold and the beautiful vonden lijken

7364309 de sage van ellert en brammert is een verzonnen verhaal met twee functies ten eerste is het een verklaringsverhaal en ten tweede is het een waarschuwingsverhaal het verhaal verklaart als het ware hoe de stiepel inkeping is ontstaan namelijk door een bijl hetzelfde motief komt ook in de gelderse sage van de witte wieven voor het is een griezelverhaal dat mensen en kinderen moet waarschuwen namelijk dat het gevaarlijk was zeker s nachts om in je eentje buiten het dorp te lopen of op de heide er waren dan wel geen reuzen maar gevaarlijke rovers zaten er wel

7364323 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity

7364336 the first of these internal qualifications is that every candidate for initiation into the mysteries of freemasonry must come of his own free will and accord emphasis and footnotes omitted
7364337 and hence there are some who coming among us impued with the principles and accustomed to the usages of these non masonic other societies footnote omitted in which the persevering solicitation of candidates is considered as a legitimate and even laudible practice bring with them these preconceived notions and consider it as their duty to exert all their influence in persuading their friends to become members of the craft
7364338 men who thus misconceive the true policy of our institution should be instructed by their older and mre experienced brethren that it is wholly in opposition to all our laws and principles to ask any one to become a freemason or to exercise any kind of influence upon the minds of others except that of a truly masonic life and a practical exemplification of the tenets by which they may be induced to ask admission into our lodges
7364339 and if this were not an ancient law imbedded in the very cement that upholds our system policy alone would dictate an adherence to the voluntary usage we need not now fear that our institution will suffer from a deficiency of members our greater dread should be that in its rapid extension less care may be given to the selection of candidates than the interests and welfare of the order demand there can therefore be no excuse for the practice of persuading candidates but every hope of safety in avoiding such a practice
7364340 hey come talk to this guy hed be a great addition to the lodge
7364341 it should always be borne in mind that the candidate who comes to our altar not of his own free will and accord footnote omitted but induced by the persuasions of his friends no matter how worthy he may otherwise be violates by so coming the requirements of the institution on the very threshold of its temple and in ninety nine cases out of a hundred fails to become imbued with that zealous attachment to the order which is absolutely essential to the formation of a true masonic character

7364350 the lawsuit stems from an 850 million judgment a multnomah county jury awarded the german truck manufacturer man ag in december 2006 man ag had sued freightliner over a transaction dispute that originated in the united kingdom before the state could collect 60 of the punitive damages however freightliner settled the case with man outside of court the settlement included dropping the punitive damages portion of the jury award

7364352 american people where obama comes from and what his vision is for the country
7364353 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7364354 it doesnt matter who we pick there isnt going to be any footage or any video of john mccains running mate saying that they would be honored to support barack obama for president because the country would be better off
7364355 this campaign has already accomplished so many amazing things for one its cut through the old school partisanship that currently plagues washington

7364357 i know im known for speaking my mind hopefully clearly and strongly
7364358 but i do it on behalf of the middle class
7364359 my plan quite frankly is to roll up my sleeves and do what youve been doing make the phone calls knock on the doors talk to new voters and new supporters face to face
7364360 we have set a 12 point charter of demands before guruji soren and if he agrees to them we will support him
7364361 so i am going to support guruji when he stakes claim for formation of government
7364362 heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7364363 if he gets a chance to travel across southern ohio our opportunities at success increase every time he visits that important region of the state
7364364 with all due respect it is very easy for ceos executives and politicians who all have paid sick days themselves to oppose them for everyone else
7364365 apparently they think paid sick days are unworkable and economically harmful only if regular people are able to earn them
7364366 stephanie was hot property ahead of the games of the xxix olympiad she then backed up the widespread attention with three world record breaking swims and three gold medals
7364367 with her unbelievable ability and wonderful smile stephanie has captured the hearts of all australians during her fantastic olympic campaign
7364368 she returns to australia a sporting hero and deservedly so
7364369 we are thrilled she has decided to sign with channel 7
7364370 general opinion in the party is in favor of parting ways
7364371 i see the parties on two different paths because the promises and the agreements are not being fulfilled
7364372 the strategies that have helped china grow from poverty to its current levels will not yield the same dividends in the future
7364373 americans who worry that china might overtake the united states are worrying about the wrong thing
7364374 they should instead be concerned that beijing may not make key reforms or that it will face significant economic difficulties down the road serious troubles in chinas economy could threaten the stability of the u s and global economies
7364375 for overhauls in the next few years china will cross the threshold to a majority urban society since urban workers earn more than three times as much as rural ones the annual migration of more than 10 million farmers into cities has steadily boosted the economy
7364376 one economic growth in china will stop at some point because of the energy constraint or china has to reduce energy consumption or improve energy efficiency significantly
7364377 the party will need to take itself on in very difficult ways to address this issue
7364378 will be a wedge issue among the ruling elites not just an issue that divides the haves and the have nots
7364379 sucking too hard on your lollipop oh loves gonna get you down
7364380 we do not expect to be deeply moved by what is not unusual
7364381 the performance wasnt error free it was never going to be that when you look at the context and the fact the springboks were desperate you only have to look at the carnage in the changing shed to see that while it wasnt error free the intensity and desperation got the boys up
7364382 you look at history and its an indication of how hard it is they did what had to be done and they did it the hard way the key now is can we back up
7364383 there will be many who will suggest we cant and history will suggest that also we have a great opportunity to achieve that this weekend and thats what we will concentrate on
7364384 physically patient in the way the blokes met the physicality of south africa because they were a desperate side and they were brutal
7364385 looking at the performance itself there are a couple of blokes who did really well
7364386 rocky elsom coming off injury went 80 minutes sam cordingley off very little background of rugby did really well they gutsed it out it wasnt perfect but it was good
7364387 james was a guy coming off injury as well and there were a couple of times in the game where he went beyond the call made a tackle got up contested the ball chased and he was dead he was out on his feet but he just refused to register that fact
7364388 will this idea work with a smaller market penetration rate
7364389 this is how were going to make your life easier
7364390 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7364391 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7364392 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7364393 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7364394 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7364395 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7364396 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7364397 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention
7364398 for as long as it holds a shareholding of below 15per cent
7364399 australia welcomes foreign investment but only where it meets australias national interests
7364400 more carefully consider proposals by consumers to control existing producing firms
7364401 we need to ensure that investment is consistent with australias aim of ensuring that decisions continue to be driven by commercial considerations and that australia remains a reliable supplier in the future to all current and potential trading partners
7364402 no apologies for thoroughly assessing applications of this nature to ensure they are in australias national interests
7364403 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7364404 treasurers statement reflected the normal firb process and that the miner had noted chinalcos undertakings
7364405 was driving a bmw when she made an unsafe turn and another car hit her it was determined that she was at fault but no crime was committed
7364406 drugs and alcohol were not involved it was just a typical car accident there was no serious damage to either vehicle
7364407 jean claude van damme is a french police officer who seemingly is at the top of his game
7364408 isnt the best example of a solid action movie as the film borrows the typical action story cliches and mixes them in with a few explosions
7364409 to be enjoyable throughout will i want to see it again probably not but i didnt mind the 100 minutes i invested into it if youre a
7364410 did have the standard action film soundfield lots of explosions guns fights what is presented is rather impressive
7364411 i wanted to give people a chance to raise those issues directly with me and their ward councillors
7364412 and im really pleased with the clinics held so far weve had a good turnout at all of them and managed to address a range of concerns
7364413 any onslow western ward resident who wants to talk to either myself or councillors foster coughlan or morrison about an issue in their community can come along
7364414 i think it will be a worry for anyone thats not ideal that situation where weve got guys with carry over points but we play in a very volatile and aggressive sport
7364415 and we ask our players to play tough hard footy and sometimes that drags them a little bit close to the line so they are vulnerable to reports and suspensions
7364416 but over the course of the last 10 to 12 weeks our players have been pretty good
7364417 weve looked at a lot of other sides not just teams we play in the present era but previous sides that were very successful in september who have had a number of players that were able to float from forward to back
7364418 he is such an aggressive competitor and he has such great leg speed and they are usually the traits you like in your back half and thats why weve played him there for the bulk of the past two or three seasons
7364419 but we didnt want him pigeon holed as a defender for the rest of his career because we think hes got some key attributes that can help us from time to time
7364420 it is ironic that the guy who had the least amount of possessions on the oval probably had the greatest influence on the contest and in my view that was campbell brown
7364421 best in class organizations are taking an additional critical step and are measuring application performance not only from the perspective of their data center components but also from the end user perspective these organizations are ensuring that improvements in application availability response times and usability translate into improved employee satisfaction and productivity and ultimately improved customer satisfaction mitigation of lost revenue opportunities and avoid damages to brand image
7364422 hey we just got sharepoint and we want it to do this
7364423 a new tough foreign policy approach that is neither republican nor democratic
7364424 taking pride in how much this country has transformed itself in my lifetime
7364425 a remarkable thing perhaps unequaled in modern history i dont think we have to shy away from the significance of that

7364430 we thought the extended warranty section was both poetic and quixotic
7364431 it remains unclear what my husband wanted from the vendor
7364432 the nearest of these service people was a rock dealer
7364433 one can hardly believe that an owners manual however well written is worthy of the smythe
7364434 we have only made initial inquiries and greg has been too concerned about the girl and said he will come and see me first thing in the morning to tell me more
7364435 one had a high content of sulphate so it is unfit for human consumption but weve found another pit which has potable water
7364436 theres only about 90 megs of water in that were working out how to get it from point a to point b
7364437 all i can say is that weve taken steps to put drinking water in place which should have been done years ago
7364438 i would say there probably are some people drinking it if they are i hope theyre looking after their health
7364439 weve always struggled with water but its never been as bad as this
7364440 weve been promised by the premier that cloncurry is not going to run out of water
7364441 its just an introduction to a different reality but what i think you can gain from it is an appreciation of their lives
7364442 you can do anything you want to do with your life as long as you have this kind of education
7364443 margaret told me she was very concerned for kens safety
7364444 el di logo no est roto la prefecta no nos dio respuestas concretas y nosotros mantenemos el bloqueo que ya est masificado
7364445 nosotros ya tenemos masificado los piquetes de bloqueo tenemos toda la voluntad de dialogar para ver como podemos llegar a acuerdos para por lo menos solucionar uno o dos puntos concretos
7364446 para evitar una espiral de violencia con mayores desgracias es que nuestras autoridades nacionales y departamentales deben hacer a un lado toda medida coercitiva e intentar entre ambos una tregua a la hostilidad y la tregua social
7364447 no despu s de las muertes o el derramamiento de la sangre
7364448 desde la prensa el defensor del pueblo y un conjunto de instituciones estamos en la obligaci n de insistir y se alarles que tienen el derecho al reclamo a dar su punto de vista su visi n de pa s pero por encima de esos derechos est n las obligaciones de garantizar la estabilidad pol tica econ mica y social
7364449 el defensor del pueblo no tirar la toalla seguir abogando por el di logo y rechazar siempre la violencia
7364450 lo que se plantea ahora no es un acto arbitrario del jefe de estado es que este proceso constitucional este proceso legal concluya con lo que debe concluir con lo que dijimos siempre que deb a concluir con la aprobaci n por parte del pueblo en un referendo constitucional
7364451 el gobierno siempre actu en base a la legalidad quienes han actuado al margen de la ley fueron quienes entre cuatro paredes redactaron sus estatutos sobre autonom as y lo han pretendido hacer aprobar y ahora no pueden aplicarlo ni lo van a aplicar jam s porque est al margen de la ley est al margen de la constituci n
7364452 la voz del pueblo como decimos los cat licos es incluso la voz de dios de lo que se trata es de concluir la constituyente mediante un referendo en el que el pueblo sea el que tenga la palabra final

7364466 weve been very interested in it and finding out how ready colleges are for these students
7364467 2012 isnt all yours hillary if i happen to lose
7364468 the erosion has been going on for years but it is being accelerated by sea level rise so we have to act earlier than we would have had to
7364469 its about balancing the interests of the site and finding the most sensible solution
7364470 weve got to bear in mind the impacts of climate change such as increased storminess
7364471 it is cautious to assume a significant proportion will fail
7364472 such a warning from the environment agency must be taken extremely seriously the failure of just one container could prove catastrophic
7364473 absence of robust arguments which demonstrate that this target is achievable in practice
7364474 that are not expected to be durable over periods of hundreds of years
7364475 it is not clear how package integrity during storage can be assured over the extended timescales now being suggested
7364476 if we are going to dispose of the waste this should be done as quickly as reasonably possible
7364477 offsetting schemes are now widely acknowledged to be problematic responses to the challenge of climate change most significantly in offsetting schemes commercial advantage and environmental benefits have become entangled to the extent that a crisis of legitimacy has occurred
7364478 offsetting schemes are conceptually problematic they have arisen not from attempts by environmentalists and climate scientists to design an appropriate response to climate change but from politicians and business executives trying to meet the demands for action while preserving the commercial status quo
7364479 when you cut up chicken rinse that salmonella garbage down the sink
7364480 whew thank god that wasnt the salmonella plate it all would have been in her face
7364481 right before you called she pulled a plate off the counter top it was full of water amp she got it in her mouth amp eyes the look on her face was hilarious
7364482 you had better tell me you are kidding she was choking on it she swallowed that hit what do i do
7364483 should i call poison control take her to the emergency room call her doctor
7364484 i dont know what to do call the doctor or poison control i guess
7364485 ok i will and ill give her a bath real quick you get on the internet amp look up what salmonella poisoning can do to a baby call me back when you have the information
7364486 how many times have i asked you to rinse that plate off you know she can reach things on the counter top now and now because of your laziness you are telling me our baby could die
7364487 ive watched you fade away have you lost sight of the dreams of yesterday dont fuck up your life youre doubting control now youre a victim youre losing your soul

7364490 as we progress through the week and watch him on the side and watch him do things we will have to take it in our hands and not his hands
7364491 he is different from what he was earlier in the season in terms of velocity and other types of things
7364492 i have no idea whats going on i just want to pitch
7364493 the problem is that the higher the burden of taxation the less opportunity there is for growth
7364494 if you want to get further growth then the state has got to take less from people in tax as you reduce the levels of taxation you will get growth
7364495 just as the country is having to tighten its belt clearly we are going to have to look at priorities for public expenditure
7364496 we have reached the limits and in my view we have got to make economies i think we have reached the end of the road
7364497 it is deeply regrettable that any party should be trying to make political capital in these circumstances out of what are routine ministerial visits

7364509 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7364510 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7364511 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7364512 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7364513 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7364514 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7364515 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7364516 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7364517 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7364518 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7364519 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7364520 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7364521 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7364522 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7364523 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7364524 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7364525 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7364526 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7364527 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7364528 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7364529 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7364530 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7364531 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7364532 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7364533 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7364534 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7364535 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7364536 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7364537 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7364538 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7364539 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7364540 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7364541 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7364542 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7364543 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7364544 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7364545 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7364546 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7364547 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7364548 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7364549 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7364550 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7364551 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7364552 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7364553 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7364554 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7364555 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7364556 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7364557 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7364558 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7364559 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7364560 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7364561 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials

7364592 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7364593 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7364594 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7364595 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7364596 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7364597 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7364598 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7364599 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7364600 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7364601 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7364602 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7364603 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7364604 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7364605 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7364606 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7364607 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7364608 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7364609 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7364610 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7364611 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7364612 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7364613 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7364614 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7364615 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7364616 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here
7364617 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7364618 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7364619 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7364620 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7364621 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7364622 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7364623 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7364624 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7364625 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7364626 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7364627 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7364628 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7364629 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7364630 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7364631 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7364632 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7364633 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7364634 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7364635 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7364636 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7364637 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7364638 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7364639 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7364640 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7364641 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7364642 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7364643 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7364644 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7364645 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7364646 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7364647 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7364648 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7364649 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7364650 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7364651 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7364652 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7364653 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7364654 tra 2 giorni ho il passaporto fra 3 giorni parto vienimi a prendere in aeroporto a san diego sono carico
7364655 dove vai cos di corsa vieni qua e aprimi la valigia
7364656 this is the only reality there is if you can get it down on paper in words notes or color so much the better
7364657 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7364658 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7364659 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7364660 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7364661 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7364662 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7364663 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7364664 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7364665 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7364666 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7364667 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7364668 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7364669 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7364670 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7364671 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7364672 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7364673 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7364674 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7364675 jesse jackson won south carolina in 84 and 88 jackson ran a good campaign and obama ran a good campaign here
7364676 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7364677 h uman activity affecting the atmosphere is very likely an important driving factor
7364678 it might be about 1 5 degrees warmer at the end of this century
7364679 but global warming as proclaimed by al gore and co is a hoax
7364680 it should also be remembered that science is based on facts not consensus
7364681 pois ser uma satisfa o perfeitamente positiva ingerir alimentos sadios ter menos barulho estar num meio ambiente equilibrado n o mais sofrer restri es de circula o etc
7364682 economic growth is the key to environmental progress because it is growth that provides the resources for investment in clean technologies growth is the solution not the problem
7364683 se as tend ncias atuais de crescimento na popula o mundial industrializa o polui o produ o de alimentos e deple o de recursos continuarem imut veis os limites do crescimento neste planeta ser o atingidos nos pr ximos 100 anos
7364684 with current and near current technology we can support 15 billion people in the world at twenty thousand dollars per capita for a millennium and that seems to be a very conservative statement
7364685 com a atual e pr xima tecnologia poderemos suportar 15 bilh es de pessoas no mundo com 20 mil d lares per capita por um mil nio e isso parece ser uma afirma o bastante conservadora
7364686 as condi es materiais da vida continuar o a melhorar para a maioria das pessoas na maioria dos pa ses na maioria do tempo indefinidamente
7364687 human beings and the natural world are on a collision course

7364691 o produto interno bruto mede tudo exceto aquilo que faz a vida valer a pena
7364692 it is the emergence of mass media which makes possible the use of propaganda techniques on a societal scale
7364693 a emerg ncia de uma m dia de massa que torna poss vel o uso de t cnicas de propaganda em uma escala de sociedade
7364694 a utopia est l no horizonte me aproximo dois passos ela se afasta dois passos caminho dez passos e o horizonte corre dez passos por mais que eu caminhe jamais alcan arei para que serve a utopia serve para isso para que eu n o deixe de caminhar
7364695 the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death
7364696 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities

7364698 the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approaches born to those who have thrice defied him born as the seventh month dies and the dark lord will mark him as his equal but he will have power the dark lord knows not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born as the seventh month dies
7364699 i felt that you already had enough responsibilities to be going on with
7364700 she appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin there was a tiny hole in her glove
7364701 after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure
7364702 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7364703 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7364704 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7364705 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7364706 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7364707 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7364708 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7364709 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7364710 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7364711 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7364712 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7364713 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7364714 a me fait horriblement mal comment faire je suis du coup dans de moins bonnes conditions pour le satisfaire pleinement
7364715 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7364716 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7364717 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7364718 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7364719 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7364720 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7364721 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7364722 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7364723 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7364724 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7364725 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7364726 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7364727 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7364728 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7364729 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7364730 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7364731 ma queue brule jai le feu a la bite au secours
7364732 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7364733 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7364734 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7364735 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7364736 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7364737 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7364738 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7364739 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7364740 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7364741 o jeez cassie trying to hook me up with another one of her friends no way
7364742 hey whats your name my name is sarah and we should totally hang out sometime omg
7364743 well we notice that your picking up veryquickly and your able to handle yourself very efficiently which most people tend to freeze which you arent doing me and john owner have been talking and ive been authorized to offer you a full time position with us i know you have your other job that you need to consider as well and thats perfectly fine if you want to stay part time thats fine too your job is secure if you do descide to go full time with us and need to give them notice thats no problem as well just think about it and let me know by monday that was if you want to stay part time i can go ahead and send out advertisements on another part time position
7364744 it doesnt matter because all that matters is what god thinks of me
7364745 why do you want to go and spend good money on something like that for
7364746 ma un bacio non violenza una mano allungata non violenza
7364747 each side is to bear its own attorneys fees and costs
7364748 if any legal action or proceeding be brought by either party to this agreement
7364749 the legislature did not intend to include settlement proceeds received by the plaintiff in exchange for a dismissal in favor of the defendant by precluding consideration of settlement proceeds as a net monetary recovery when a dismissal is entered in favor of the defendant only one party qualifies for a mandatory award of costs consistent with prior law which held defendant was the prevailing party in a voluntary dismissal situation
7364750 would lead to an absurd result as both plaintiff and defendants would be entitled to an award of costs as a matter of right
7364751 based on a pragmatic assessment of the extent to which chinn and cplp realized their objectives through the settlement
7364752 attorney fees based on a contract provision do not need to be demanded in the complaint
7364753 although there does not appear to be any prohibition against the motion that chinn filed the time limits for filing a motion for an award of attorney fees would not be altered by filing a motion for an entitlement to fees
7364754 valerie is our most expensive lady perhaps another lady would do as well
7364755 it will cost you 5000 for a one hour session with me
7364756 i dont remember anyone ever visiting me three nights in a row where are you from
7364757 i was your mothers attorney she died and left you fifteen thousand dollars
7364758 we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well
7364759 therefore youve got to take a hard line approach to this so theres conditionality which is that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments that the regular attendance at school by their kids as a necessary pre condition we think thats the right way to go
7364760 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7364761 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7364762 i will appear personally at the hearing if required definitely
7364763 i supported him at court so why am i not going to do it at the fa
7364764 for me it is the same thing if you support someone you support them
7364765 if you believe they have turned a corner you believe they have turned a corner
7364766 if you believe that then what is wrong with saying it so i will just support him 100 percent
7364767 i know a lot of people dont agree with me i have had lots of letters and i have seen all the postbags
7364768 it is for me to make that decision on barton and i have made what i think is the right decision
7364769 soaring with the eagles at night to rise with the pigs in the morning
7364770 im pleased about the declaration and grateful to president bush
7364771 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7364772 by the conlanging community we at the conlang wikibook want to help you make the language that youd like to make not the one that you already speak
7364773 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7364774 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7364775 biofuels is an backdrop that is seeing redoubtable freshness we are stimulated in come a musical score apropos of that newness on providing ethanol manufacturers attended by uppermost running start technologies that beautify profitability this hour pavilions ethics on route to delivering financial and environmental benefits so that our customers is evidenced in accordance with our 300 percent decennium into the bargain sun sales blossoming inflowing the ethanol loyalty
7364776 we need to win some games it doesnt matter how
7364777 i would say it was the best one i have had this year it was a special
7364778 marte has thrown 12 pitches in the last nine days you havent
7364779 lho acquistata ad inizio di luglio 2007 in due mesi ho persorso 8 000 km tanto di cappello al motore che non finisce pi ha 141 cv con una coppia notevole nonostante il suo peso di 18 quintali
7364780 oggi sono andato a vedere una chevrolet captiva convinto di comprarla e invece sono tornato a casa con una actyon appena lho vista qualche tempo fa su una rivista ho esclamato che cesso di macchina oggi mi ci sono seduto dentro ci ho girato intorno 10 volte lho messa in moto e me ne sono innamorato consiglio di guardarla bene
7364781 what i expected i saw out on the field in england you never say first versus last is easy
7364782 why is he one of the best in the world because he is very clever it was a very good goal
7364783 tomorrow is the start of a new week and when i return to london i will discuss who stays and who goes
7364784 we have started with two wins but we are very early into the season
7364785 if it was the last two games of the season then it would be different
7364786 the top teams only lose two or three games a season and we have missed an outstanding chance
7364787 chelsea have had a bad day in my opinion but one piece of brilliance by deco has won it for them
7364788 chelsea didnt at any stage look like they were going to romp it like they did against portsmouth last week
7364789 sometimes you ride your own luck against the big teams but we havent had to ride our luck in this game
7364790 my players gave me everything they had apart from a goal
7364791 il a t calcul que si chaque oeuf de cabillaud pondu dans la mer arrivait maturit on pourrait
7364792 uh those rides arent fun anymore once youre over 20
7364793 biofuels is an backdrop that is seeing redoubtable freshness we are stimulated in come a musical score apropos of that newness on providing ethanol manufacturers attended by uppermost running start technologies that beautify profitability this hour pavilions ethics on route to delivering financial and environmental benefits so that our customers is evidenced in accordance with our 300 percent decennium into the bargain sun sales blossoming inflowing the ethanol loyalty
7364794 our hearts are deceitful above all things and desperately wicked
7364795 there is no doubt that it was a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
7364796 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7364797 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7364798 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7364799 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7364800 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7364801 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7364802 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7364803 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7364804 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7364805 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7364806 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7364807 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7364808 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7364809 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7364810 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7364811 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7364812 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7364813 we dont run too many plays we just spread the floor break guys down and share the ball
7364814 mama sunshine is annoying and asks a fuckload of questions
7364815 mama sunshine is bored walking around and wants to write cuz shes a journalist in joness office and secretary for his detective office mama sunshine works hard on her work she is flei
7364816 i will appear personally at the hearing if required definitely
7364817 i supported him at court so why am i not going to do it at the fa
7364818 for me it is the same thing if you support someone you support them
7364819 if you believe they have turned a corner you believe they have turned a corner
7364820 if you believe that then what is wrong with saying it so i will just support him 100 percent
7364821 i know a lot of people dont agree with me i have had lots of letters and i have seen all the postbags
7364822 it is for me to make that decision on barton and i have made what i think is the right decision
7364823 we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well
7364824 therefore youve got to take a hard line approach to this so theres conditionality which is that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments that the regular attendance at school by their kids as a necessary pre condition we think thats the right way to go
7364825 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7364826 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7364827 its part of our approach of mutual responsibility and we think it is an important way to go because its those kids who miss out from regular school attendance who are going to be the most vulnerable across the entire country
7364828 the maple leafs are perennially and justifiably measured against the franchises last stanley cup winner in 1967 and there are precious few examples of reliable team defense in the past 41 years of the 18 men that have coached the club since 67 only two have shown an ability to reverse the usual trend roger neilson did it spectacularly for one season 1977 78 and pat burns coerced a generally spartan club to mind its own end for a couple of years in the early 90s the good leaf teams under pat quinn were known for their creativity on the attack and were made to look better defensively on many nights by the brilliance of goalie curtis joseph so wilson isnt up against tradition in his attempt to mould the current leafs into a responsible group
7364829 what he wilson confronts is a team entirely devoid at the moment of an elite skater neilson had front line players such as darryl sittler lanny mcdonald and borje salming to work with burns went to war with a middling blue line but with arguably the best two way forward in the nhl and undisputedly the leagues top defensive centre doug gilmour on gilmours flank was a 50 goal shooter in dave andreychuk quinn benefitted from joseph and the prime years of mats sundin wilson has no such commodity goalie vesa toskala is his brightest asset and thats a good start but the leafs will need to gradually assemble a nucleus of top level forwards and defensemen if they are to become a juggernaut behind centre ice or a force in the offensive zone teams that are capable of doing both compete for the stanley cup and are routinely comprised of three to five all star caliber skaters that grade of personnel will not materialize overnight in toronto
7364830 what i expected i saw out on the field in england you never say first versus last is easy
7364831 why is he one of the best in the world because he is very clever it was a very good goal
7364832 tomorrow is the start of a new week and when i return to london i will discuss who stays and who goes
7364833 we have started with two wins but we are very early into the season
7364834 if it was the last two games of the season then it would be different
7364835 the top teams only lose two or three games a season and we have missed an outstanding chance
7364836 chelsea have had a bad day in my opinion but one piece of brilliance by deco has won it for them
7364837 chelsea didnt at any stage look like they were going to romp it like they did against portsmouth last week
7364838 sometimes you ride your own luck against the big teams but we havent had to ride our luck in this game
7364839 my players gave me everything they had apart from a goal
7364840 this is an extremely difficult time for me and my family
7364841 i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support my main concern at the moment is the welfare of our family
7364842 i will be making no further comment at this time and would request that the privacy of our family is respected

7364844 vogliamo denunciare un grave episodio accaduto questa mattina di cui stata testimone una mediatrice interculturale di moncalieri
7364845 non ce ne frega niente della vostra carta di identit italiana
7364846 ha incontrato il favore dellopinione pubblica anche se stato contrastato dagli abitanti delle localit direttamente coinvolte
7364847 la popolarit del governo stando ai pi recenti sondaggi cresciuta del 10 per cento
7364848 oggi dice loris de filippi responsabile dei progetti di msf si teme che queste condizioni con lestensione a 18 mesi del periodo massimo di permanenza allinterno dei cpta non possano che peggiorare
7364849 molto preoccupata per lipotesi di espulsione per chi chiede lo status di rifugiato dopo il primo diniego da parte della commissione che esamina la prima domanda se dovesse passare questo principio ci sarebbe un peggioramento anche rispetto alla bossi fini in italia aggiunge boldrini nel 2007 hanno fatto richiesta dasilo 14 mila persone settemila delle quali arrivate via mare il 10 ha ottenuto lo status di rifugiato secondo la convenzione di ginevra mentre oltre il 50 ha ottenuto la protezione umanitaria dunque le autorit italiane hanno accertato che pi del 60 di chi chiede asilo politico dice la verit non viene qui ad imbrogliare nessuno ecco dove nasce la nostra preoccupazione nasce dal fatto che se si restringono i termini del ricorso e del riesame si rischia di cacciare persone che al contrario avrebbero tutto il diritto di essere considerati profughi
7364850 come si pu pensare che i provvedimenti previsti nel pacchetto sicurezz abbiano una qualche efficacia le persone che si vorrebbero tenere lontane dal nostro paese fuggono nella maggior parte dei casi dalla povert quando non da guerra e persecuzioni non sar certo il reato di immigrazione clandestina a tenerle lontane litalia deve invece mostrare lungimiranza e fare seriamente la sua parte nel combattere la povert nel mondo ad esempio adeguando le proprie quote di aiuto allo sviluppo ai livelli europei piuttosto che spendere ancora di pi in strutture dalla dubbia efficacia come i cpt in quanto ong che basa la propria azione sul rispetto dei diritti umani ha aggiunto de ponte siamo inoltre preoccupati per quei provvedimenti contenuti nel pacchetto sicurezz che mettono in discussione il principio di uguaglianza di fronte alla legge che dovrebbe essere riconosciuto a ogni essere umano come la possibilit di detenere per lungo tempo uno straniero solo su base amministrativa e senza lintervento di un giudice
7364851 per lo meno controproducente affrontare limmigrazione considerando solo la dimensione repressiva e della devianza delle persone che arrivano da altri paese i dati oggettivi dicono che queste persone sono una risorsa per la societ italiana ne sono un esempio le 400 mila badandi che chiedono di essere regolarizzate aggiungo un altro dato tanto per fare un altro esempio senza le rimesse della comunit salvadoregna la povert di quel paese sarebbe aggravata di sette volte
7364852 datemi voce e spazio perch sui giornali di domani non si legger quello che accaduto si legger che i manifestanti di chiaiano sono entrati in contatto con la polizia ma io ero l e la storia unaltra alle 20 e 20 almeno 100 uomini tra poliziotti carabinieri e guardie di finanza hanno caricato la gente inerme in prima fila non solo uomini ma donne di ogni et e persone anziane cittadini tenaci ma civili davanti agli occhi vedo ancora le loro mani alzate che nel tratto estremo di via santa maria a cubito presidiavano un incrocio tra le 19 05 e le 20 20 i due schieramenti si sono solo fronteggiati poi la polizia in tenuta antisommossa ha iniziato a caricare la scena sembrava surreale a guardarli dallalto i poliziotti sembravano solo procedere in avanti ma chi era per strada ne ha apprezzato la tecnica calci negli stinchi colpi alle ginocchia con la parte estrema e bassa del manganello i migliori strappavano orologi o braccialetti cos nel vano tentativo di recuperali cera chi abbassava le mani e veniva trascinato a terra per i polsi la loro avanzata non ha risparmiato nessuno mi ha colpito soprattutto la violenza contro le donne tantissime sono state spinte a terra graffiate strattonate dietro la plastica dei caschi mi restano nella memoria gli occhi indifferenti senza battiti di ciglia dei poliziotti quando sono scappata pi per la sorpresa che per la paura trascinavano via due giovani uomini mentre tante donne erano sullasfalto livide di paura e rannicchiate la gente urlava ma non rispondeva alla violenza inveiva invece contro i giornalisti al sicuro sul balcone di una pizzeria impegnati nel fotografare chiusa ogni via di accesso alle 21 le camionette erano gi almeno venti ma la gente di chiaiano non se ne era andata alle 21 30 oltre 1000 persone erano ancora in strada la storia questa datemi voce e spazio perch si sappia quello che accaduto lo stato di polizia e latmosfera violenta di questa sera somigliano troppo a quelli dei regimi totalitaristi proprio quelli di cui racconto con orrore ai miei studenti durante le lezioni di storia

7364891 ive every confidence that when people come to london in 2012 they will find a city that is very different from 1908
7364892 theres one thing that visitors to our olympics will find is completely unchanged and that is that every one of the games will have been well i mourn the passing of some of these games
7364893 for instance the pankration whose chief exponent was milo of croton whose signature performance involved carrying an ox the length of the stadium killing it with his bare hands and then eating it all on the same day
7364894 er but they will find this unchanged virtually every single one of our international sports were either invented or codified by the british they were and i say this respectfully to our chinese hosts who have excelled so magnificently at ping pong
7364895 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england ladies and gentlemen in the 19th century it was and it was called whiff whaff
7364896 and there i think you have the essential difference between us and the rest of the world other nations the french looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner we looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to play whiff whaff
7364897 and that is why london is the sporting capital of the world
7364898 and i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home
7364899 direi che per giochi in serie a quindi potresti anche smuovere il tuo culetto da

7364901 if one day the situation were reversed and the fate of the vanquished lay in my hands then i would let all the ordinary folk go and even some of the leaders who might perhaps after all have had honourable intentions and not know what they were doing but i would have all the intellectuals strung up and the professors three feet higher than the rest they would be left hanging from the lampposts for as long as was compatible with hygiene
7364902 of course the media are free to go to tibet
7364903 but as you know due to the recent riots that are happening in tibet there is a limitation not only for the media but also for the general public to go to tibet so i think maybe you need approval but in general the media in the past and the present and the future are free to go to tibet

7364912 be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7364913 lets hope he has something left in the tank to help us gain a victory on saturday
7364914 we were only able to play with one forward and i had no forwards on the bench to change things
7364915 i never took my eyes off the ball for a second
7364916 ive committed myself ive gone for the ball unfortunately the collisions ended with the keeper coming off worst but there was no malice in it
7364917 theres always a concern when you see an incident like that but they stabilised him and did all the correct things
7364918 i dont think theres any concern about there being a neck injury
7364919 its more the fact that hes got a bang on the head and is groggy he will be kept in for observation but hopefully in a couple of days he will be fine
7364920 it the goal should have stood and it has cost us two points
7364921 in the last couple of weeks all we have heard is that the old firm get every decision going well today shows that isnt the case it never has been i just hope referees and officials are not bowing to the pressure
7364922 it was a clear handball but the referee did not give it he is obviously a celtic fan i was so angry i could have knocked the referee out lets have a look at him and his refereeing
7364923 people have shown belief in me and given me the opportunity to show what i can do so hopefully i can grab that a different manager comes in with his own beliefs and ideas before i didnt feel i got the opportunities i deserved but now its coming together
7364924 because they havent got the financial resources they cant compete talent wise but they can compete fitness wise
7364925 nickys a million per cent behind what were trying to do here
7364926 in the last five or six years ive played in six different leagues
7364927 when i was in non league my goal was to play in the championship
7364928 the boys had signalled to me minutes earlier to try and get garry off before it got any worse
7364929 fortunately it was only a dead leg and he was able to jump at the back post for the goal it was a very very good performance from quincy and the fans took to him hes exciting hes not only quick he does have a wee trick he doesnt run up blind alleys he can see pictures and he can only get better
7364930 i know that the players know that and the fans know that
7364931 obviously pauls not very happy but its not just one persons responsibility the crowds reaction was justified but promotion is the goal and i dont see why we cant turn it around
7364932 there will always be times in a game even physical games where you can play football
7364933 has got nothing to do with the situation i was in
7364934 its got nothing to do with him if we lost two games
7364935 if a player didnt want to play for me i know what id do
7364936 id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go just to get rid of him i had a player two years ago when i got my job who i heard had been speaking to another club and i just sold him and said off you go and he went ok and off he popped i wouldnt try too hard to talk a player out of moving
7364937 those teams dont get about us like english teams do
7364938 teams like roma will let you play but against teams who show grit and determination roll their sleeves up and battle against you its a different kettle of fish we got a bit excited when we started beating teams 5 0 and 3 0 and weve come back to reality with a bump
7364939 i have a big point to prove after the way i finished at liverpool
7364940 i think i can do really well in the premier league it suits the way i play im made for england
7364941 well have to put a good performance on when we go to chelsea
7364942 because theyll wipe the floor with us if we dont
7364943 he nearly lost his life hes very very lucky and hes still got the scars to show that he was out for a couple of months he was in a sorry state when he got back and there were other issues about whether he would play for his country again or whether he wouldnt but the kid has got over that
7364944 hes a gem of a lad and when youre bringing him on with 20 minutes to go he can be a handful and he was against villa
7364945 its like a corner though its flatter and is possibly more dangerous
7364946 it brought us a lot of goals last season were a big team and if we werent it would be pointless throwing it in there i think weve got perhaps eight six footers out there
7364947 wed have been delighted whoever got the goal as long as wed won but when he got it there was a little smile on everyones faces
7364948 its quite unfortunate because centre forwards are judged on one thing only and thats how many goals they get mama got quite a bit of stick last year from everyone in general but his work ethic makes him a big cog in the machine
7364949 they played at a tempo that was too much for us
7364950 hes technically good with two strong feet and a scrapper throwing his body in to block shots weve lacked that
7364951 we are in a tough period and im having to play a patched up team which has limited what we can do ive never known it at everton where ive been so short of players i wasnt being flippant when i said i wanted to bring seven in before the deadline am i confident we will well ive not brought in one yet so there you go im going to try all routes including loans but i dont think you can get the quality im looking for with a few days of the sales to go
7364952 i have been waking up every morning at 3am and then not being able to get back to sleep
7364953 ive never been north but im at chelsea for two seasons so i must get used to bolton manchester united manchester city
7364954 what i expected i saw today it was difficult winning 1 0 away from home in england is the same as winning 10 0 elsewhere wigan played better than portsmouth and had players who are healthy have power and pressured us i know we didnt play as well as we did last week but i understand the reasons why
7364955 it didnt matter who took them they kept doing the same frigging thing
7364956 theyve had a bad day but the piece of brilliance in the game came from deco if it wasnt him it might have been from nicolas anelka if not him joe cole florent malouda theyve got a string of talent and how do you compete to think that we used to mock rangers and celtic being so dominant in scotland didnt we
7364957 i cant look at any of them and say they can hold up their hands and say they performed

7364979 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7364980 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7364981 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7364982 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7364983 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions

7364988 i don t really do many collabs but when i do i hardly charge people anyone i do charge it s because i know they have a budget and when i do charge i make them give it to charity i don t actually collect a check from them my job in this shit isn t to make money off of my voice or my rapping but to figure out how to be good enough business wise to make my art make my money for me rather than make the art the money sales are one thing but to me those are called royalties it s not like every time you buy a cd i m popping off no you buy a cd and you re helping me cover the cost of making the damn cd for starters you re also helping me cover the cost of bringing the cd to your city bringing a tour to your city that is also bringing three other rap groups to your city that you may have never experienced it s not like i ve got this incredibly genius business strategy i ain t really supposed to get rich off of rapping i m supposed to get rich off of everything else that makes itself available to me because i rap i really don t give a fuck if people hate me the elitists or the underground people that say ohh fuck him he s a sell out naw actually fuck off i know what i m doing i know what my choruses sound like i know what my beats sound like i ve never paid anyone to play my record i ve never played any of the games trying to sell lots of records the closest i ve come is making videos but videos are fun man i didn t make videos so that mtv would play them hell mtv didn t play the shit i made them because i wanted a visual to go with the song

7365086 toen ik in de wachtkamer zat te wachten tot ik het stadion in mocht was ik een beetje aan het terugdenken ik besefte toen eigenlijk pas wat er de afgelopen dagen allemaal gebeurd is ik ben normaal niet zo emotioneel maar daar in die wachtkamer was ik het wel een beetje het raakte me wel dat ik daar als vlaggendrager zat ik ben echt trots dat het me hier gelukt is dat ik gewonnen heb wordt nu steeds normaler
7365087 het maakte het wel extra bijzonder dat ik door heel veel mensen gekozen ben

7365089 i came back from vacation and i saw this good looking guy
7365090 he asked the floor lady to ask me if i would go out with him i told her if he wants to take me out he can come and ask me himself so he did we went out and weve been going out ever since
7365091 but hes got a tall dark and handsome brother would you like to meet him
7365092 when raymond morrissette kissed me goodnight at that very moment i knew that he was the man for me

7365095 whitey went to my father to ask for my hand in marriage
7365096 my father was in the shed plucking chickens my father knew what he had in mind so he kind of dragged things along because whitey was helping him pluck chickens while he got up the courage to ask
7365097 we waited two years to get married to save money by that time rita was engaged when it came time to pick the wedding day i wanted july 3
7365098 with an orchid in the center that we could pull out for a corsage when we left the reception
7365099 he had already done rose and whiteys vows then he turned to me and said rita will you take frederic to be your lawful wedded husband and i said no and his eyes became wide and again he said rita will you take frederic and i said no i want raymond frederic is over there frederic almost had two wives
7365100 we didnt see rose and whitey much because we didnt even have a car we had to take the bus to fall river to visit them
7365101 in those days the family meant more to you than friends
7365102 every sunday night was get together night at our house in the east end of fall river the whole family was invited they would come at 6 and go home at 8
7365103 and in the summer we would have clambakes at our house in westport

7365117 i used to go and watch cork when kevin doyle was playing with them

7365127 i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be
7365128 and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am

7365189 i think it will all depend on the guelph by election
7365190 if the liberals lose it to the conservatives dollars to donuts we have an election called by the conservatives thats the trigger

7365192 prime minister stephen harper really is in the drivers seat right now if he doesnt call the election and he waits too long he could be overtaken by events

7365203 but as the days of noah were so also will the coming of the son of man be for as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noah entered the ark and did not know until the flood came and took them all away so also will be in the field one will be taken and the other left two women will be grinding at the mill one will be taken and the other left
7365204 i tell you on that night there will be two men in bed one will be taken and the other left
7365205 where the body is there also will the vultures be gathered
7365206 especially this time of year because every run counts for so much right now
7365207 this loss was my fault i had the lead twice and gave it back both times

7365209 and john mccain has one of those 3 a m campaign commercials in this one its 3 a m and he just gets up to go to the bathroom

7365219 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7365220 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters
7365221 these times call for a total change in washingtons worldview and these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7365222 the secret to obamas ability to make virginia a close race can be found in his ability to attract 40 of the white vote while virginias black vote will likely be less than states such as georgia or north carolina it is substantial enough that when combined with such a strong showing among whites it falls into the recipe we see as necessary for obama to win southern states that have voted republican in recent years

7365248 it was not until he began painting that the where emerged in all its dimensionality the stories now occupied space what had been locations indexed in a kind of shorthand the cemetery the military latrine the khayder the market the inn were now spaces and they were filled with objects and people and activities and information much of which had never made it into the spoken stories
7365249 not with sadness but with great anticipation of our new life to come
7365250 was a big world out there before the holocaust there was a rich cultural life in poland as i knew it at the time
7365251 shako hats which were inspired by the hats that soldiers wore during the napoleonic wars to make them look taller and more intimidating

7365267 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga
7365268 accusations of dup intransigence are nothing more than a crude attempt to woo the provisional base after all dup and provo objectives in terms of the national question are now identical
7365269 the gifting of powers of british policing to stormont by westminster would offer nothing for the irish people and serves only to prolong the failed stormont experiment
7365270 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman

7365275 she snuggled in with the president just like she did when she was a little girl with her dad

7365282 it was a fantastic race and it was a fantastic day for me
7365283 i just didnt have it tonight i have a lot of work to do and i know i need to get stronger
7365284 i have a lot of work to do the pace was slow but theyre amazing athletes
7365285 when they made a move with three laps to go i couldnt get there fast enough and i think it cost me two or three spots
7365286 at the eight mile mark i wondered who would win i thought he ndereba was stronger than me but i had a really strong kick i was comfortable but the pace was slow because it was humid
7365287 i am excited this is my first time here and my first win the course was really tough because of the humid weather i am not used to running in the humid weather
7365288 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7365289 i came through 5k in 14 59 2 06 pace and i knew if i kept that up i couldnt finish i kept picking people off until i was 10th at about 25k then i started cramping up pretty badly
7365290 it wasnt quite as bad as i was expecting though i did the best i could with what i had sometimes you do all the work and it comes together and sometimes it doesnt
7365291 i did the same training as ever but there were too many stops and not enough continuity
7365292 every time i do a series i get people telling me they could do that job and asking how can they get to do it
7365293 i thought it would be interesting to get people out of their office towers and cubicles and put these jobs in context
7365294 this is the next evolution of the reality show what weve done is taken the essence of thoms shows and added a competition element
7365295 this is about real consequences and real work if you screw up youre out

7365301 a common mistake and this doesnt just apply to commando is that novice writers dont read the publication theyre aiming at
7365302 youve got a good idea but it needs development go away and read more commando s and then come back to me
7365303 may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november

7365309 a president in a parliamentary system should be someone above day to day politics with him controversies will continue around the presidency
7365310 politicians need to realise that with each day that passes people who face bomb blasts crippling inflation and a general sense of despair grow more distant from their government
7365311 we strongly suspect that the missing are on the lower reaches of the glacier underneath the lumps of serac pillar of ice which means we cant really do anything
7365312 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7365313 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7365314 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7365315 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7365316 i wasnt completely submerged i was able to help the others

7365321 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
7365322 if the people were ever to find out what we have done we would be chased down the streets and lynched
7365323 real courage is when you know youre licked before you begin but you begin anyway
7365324 its our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
7365325 the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and thus clamorous to be led to safety by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary

7365331 they dont want to know what happened a week ago they want to know exactly what happened right now so its very important that we move away from batch oriented systems and file dumping and move to a real live connected world which is what people expect out of the internet
7365332 its really essential to move the ownership of that data to the people who really know it create it and own it and that really plays to soa
7365333 this is the model of keeping the data where it belongs and yet making it available to the rest of the world
7365334 oh we can we can just take the system as it is and make it available as a service
7365335 you want to do some thinking and modeling about your data your data structures and how it can be accessible and so on because of this notion of leaky abstractions
7365336 you can push something in one place and something else is going to pop out in another by just taking a service as it is and making it online you may not be doing the work required to use it more effectively
7365337 soa promises to deliver business agility by breaking down barriers between silos of applications and by reusing business services
7365338 however if the data stuck inside silos is bad is stale or is inaccurate imagine the calamity the silos may disappear but then data from many different applications becomes co mingled
7365339 enterprise data is complex its about volume latency and many formats it requires that as part of soa data be treated as a strategic enterprise asset that addresses the various data integration challenges
7365340 data services is a highly flexible simple and cost effective solution that provides the model and standards based reusable abstraction layers that lower the complexity of delivering data from silos data services deliver a single consistent view of all enterprise data at the right time
7365341 enables access integration to right time data throughout the enterprise and across corporate firewalls data services create an abstraction layer to all analytical operational information and serves it up to other abstraction layers which could be an enterprise service bus

7365357 this attack happened in my hometown a hometown i do not live in or work in because of illegal behavior i hope those who swiped my ability to live there enjoy the message they got from god today

7365359 im just a pissed off civil rights activist who has to laugh when those who had directly discriminated against me saw offices i might otherwise be working in reduced to rubble there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7365360 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
7365361 there was no significant loss of life in those towers
7365362 there is no strong evidence yet for specific gene variants alleles that lead to group differences differences between clusters in behavior or intelligence but progress on the genomic side of this question will be rapid in coming years as the price to sequence a genome is dropping at an exponential rate
7365363 if i have seen farther it is by standing on the shoulders of giants
7365364 every child in the world should have an idea of being someone to be cherished and none should be called abeete or slave
7365365 but wilberforces work is still not accomplished slavery exists in many other parts of the world in different forms international protest and prayer brought down apartheid why are we silent about slavery
7365366 she thought she was coming to look after australian children and when she came from sydney airport to the house she saw toys on the floor and thought these are for the children im going to mind but she was moved immediately to a brothel in sydney and repeatedly raped until an immigration raid freed her
7365367 there must be one industrial law similarly applied to all australians aboriginal or not
7365368 it is nonsense to say that men are better off unemployed in thousands but maintained in settlement in growing degrees of comfort when they could work in the real world with growing degrees of efficiency and growing economic rewards
7365369 it is hard to imagine another society whose values were as inappropriate to the demands of an industrial economy
7365370 attain the same manner of living as other australians and live as members of a single australian community
7365371 its easy to see that as disrespect and some hillary loyalists are going to resent it
7365372 but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7365373 i dont believe we will succeed in bringing the corpses back
7365374 because they ended up in a zone of high risk with unstable ice pillars which have a high risk of collapse at the most we might be able to survey the area to see whether some signs of the presence of the bodies have emerged the only certain thing is that these people are beyond hope of being rescued
7365375 they were not hit by the avalanche they are alive and unhurt
7365376 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres
7365377 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7365378 youre ok im ok the only ones not ok are the narrow minded bigoted ones who actually believe there is only one god and only one way to heaven
7365379 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except by me
7365380 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets have gone out into the world

7365383 the commander and three of his fighters came and took my wife out of our home and took her to their house about 200 metres away and in front of these witnesses raped her
7365384 there are difficulties were rebuilding institutions including our justice institutions and there are shortcomings but the president and the government are committed to the rule of law on all equally
7365385 theyre in the government karzai the americans the british sit down with them they have impunity theyve become very courageous and can do whatever crimes they like
7365386 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
7365387 being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun
7365388 external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7365389 its a phenomenal promotion vehicle for a company or a great crisis tool or a great customer service tool
7365390 were trying to be as open and disclose as much information as we can
7365391 we gave a very loud voice to the people who said they werent happy about this decision

7365393 thats the importance of public relations of advertising of everything we do
7365394 it is the virtual substitute for bill marriott visiting every hotel
7365395 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7365396 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7365397 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7365398 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7365399 we put a lot of time and energy into this production

7365401 it was cool because gina was shooting the scene and shed jump in and out of it fool around a little bit and then jump back behind the camera i have never shot with her so i was stoked
7365402 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god

7365404 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns

7365412 i was keeping goods there and they didnt let me bring them out i lost about us850 000 978 000 and they even used 7000 boxes of cheese for protection on the roof he told afp at a commercial conference in baghdad attended by 100 businessmen
7365413 the work has improved the markets have opened iraqi traders are dealing with other companies directly he said adding that business had already taken him to france brazil and the united states
7365414 i left the country because of the violence but now that it is more secure i will return to live in baghdad at the end of this month sabah al moussawi a construction magnate told afp at the conference
7365415 i came to rebuild my country said mr moussawi who is currently working on a series of joint ventures to revamp bridges and buildings around the country but who wants joint venture partners to spread the risk

7365417 we are at the beginning we would like to establish the good basics to start and actually there are some plans started but there are still few said mr moussawi
7365418 we have very big strategic plans in iraq which include electricity and oil and the refineries and also other factories which will bring good benefits to iraq he said
7365419 doing business 2008 survey that iraq ranked 141 out of 178 economies for ease of doing business and four places lower than in 2006
7365420 thats how you could quickly get into this darker scenario
7365421 if theres a consensus its probably that prices will fall another 10 per cent between now and next summer which would be 25 per cent down from peak to trough
7365422 another 10 per cent down would put prices back consistent with rents and incomes thats a signal that housing affordability has been restored for most potential home buyers
7365423 in southern california we are still not near the bottom
7365424 you have cul de sacs in the antelope valley north of los angeles where every house is in foreclosure
7365425 the vulture buyers are going to be purchasing for as low as 30 cents on the dollar from the peak
7365426 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7365427 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7365428 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7365429 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7365430 look mate if ya cant find ya money me and me mate will play again cos your junkie brain aint workin fast enough
7365431 the overall decline in contract signings suggests we are not out of the woods by any means the housing stimulus bill that is still being considered in the senate is critical to assure a healthy recovery in the housing market jobs and the economy
7365432 some markets have seen a doubling in home sales from a year ago while others are seeing contract signings cut in half price conditions vary tremendously even within a locality depending upon a neighborhoods exposure to subprime loans
7365433 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7365434 this week the debate not just about luxury cars but about the other measures is a debate about their economic credibility and it looks like its one theyre the liberal party going to fail
7365435 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget
7365436 so were going to take them to the senate and then well see whos economically responsible and whos prepared to vote for certainty in economic policies
7365437 the liberal party is punching a huge hole in the budget surplus in the senate
7365438 stronger engagement for democracy prosperity and security in the broader region
7365439 tough measures towards moscow on the table if russia resists
7365440 it should recognize the right to eu membership in future agree to a more liberal visa regime offer a solidarity clause backing ukraines territorial integrity and move to integrate ukraine into the eus energy market
7365441 post olympics china is slowing not because the olympics are over but because of global forces
7365442 chinas macro statistics are going to look terrible the rest of this year and into 2009 china wants to act and supporting the growth rate is going to be overwhelmingly the top policy priority
7365443 our view is that the administration has a number of levers they can pull in the attempt to keep growth around 10 percent in the second half and into next year
7365444 in terms of economic growth it doesnt have any impact
7365445 were going down from stupidly fast last year to really fast this year and just plain ordinary fast next year which would be in the 8 9 percent range
7365446 its a big downshift and that may create some problems but theyll still be growing faster than any other major economy in the world
7365447 i had a lot of sleepless nights because i was nervous but this allowed me to concentrate more and train harder
7365448 i guess we are just lucky it wasnt worse but it is always sad to see something that big and old fall down
7365449 i have got a couple of pine trees that are close to my house and we unfortunately cant get our insurance company to help with preventative maintenance so we are kind of left on our own it is kind of nerve wracking gets a little bit scary

7365507 rosa was climbing down the hill one afternoon with two tiny containers in her hands filled with drinking water she fetch from the spring in the mountain when she got a glimpse of their house there were horses in front of it and she saw several men in uniforms entering the house she halted sensing danger in the air her mother was alone in the house her father and older brothers visited their farm she realized the men were japanese army the philippines was under the japanese occupation at that time and they were brutal to both the filipinos and the americans they were even more vindictive towards anyone collaborating with the rebellion group called the hukbalahap the troop against the japanese
7365508 the japanese were looking for rosas father because his cousins were members of the hukbalahap and their family was suspected to be collaborators
7365509 run my child run the japanese took their guns and fired to everyone around killing those on their way the people ran for their lives hiding in the holes they made in case of attacks rosa ran along with other children she climbed on a hill and saw a huge rock with a foxhole under it two kids were already hidden inside
7365510 if i were there i will fire back with my gun bang bang bang
7365511 many people were killed that day and most of them were children rosa survived that days slaughter however the violence she saw changed her from a refine girl into a brave fighter she grew up to join the hukbalahap along with her brothers rosa was a young woman and her brothers prohibited her from fighting with arms instead she became an informer and a deliverer of supply for the troop she fought for freedom for several years until the day when the american army took the philippines from the violent hands of the japanese and gave her freedom rosas brothers however did not live to taste that freedom they were killed during one of their battles rosa and her father lived quietly in their farm they had no one but each other but one night rosa was awakened by the wail of their carabao she hurried down the hut and saw her father lying on its back bleeding he was badly beaten and his face was unrecognizable with all might left he had managed to say the names of his assassins before he let go gardo alfredo and ronnie you will pay for this i swear rosa said weeping

7365516 formas y m todos de la planificaci n socialista y nivel del desarrollo de las fuerzas productivas
7365517 rusia no ha alcanzado tal nivel de desarrollo de las fuerzas productivas que haga posible el socialismo
7365518 pero qu hacer si una situaci n peculiar a llevado a rusia primero a la guerra imperialista mundial en la que intervinieron todos los pa ses m s o menos importantes de europa occidental y ha colocado su desarrollo al borde de las revoluciones del oriente que comienzan y que en parte han comenzado ya en unas condiciones en las cuales hemos podido llevar a la pr ctica precisamente esa alianza de la
7365519 y qu deb amos hacer si una situaci n absolutamente sin salida decuplicando las fuerzas de los obreros y campesinos abr a ante nosotros la posibilidad de pasar de una manera diferente que en todos los dem s pa ses del occidente de europa a la creaci n de las premisas fundamentales de la civilizaci n
7365520 si para implantar el socialismo se exige un determinado nivel cultural aunque nadie puede decir cu l es este determinado
7365521 en estas condiciones el razonamiento que parte exclusivamente de la noci n general de propiedad estatal para designar las diferentes formas superiores de la propiedad socialista pretendiendo reducir sta a una realidad nica tropieza con insuperables dificultades sobre todo cuando se trata de analizar la circulaci n de las mercanc as en el interior del sector socialista del estado el comercio socialista el papel de la moneda etc
7365522 este punto de partida jur dico y los an lisis que del mismo se derivan conducen a negar el car cter necesariamente mercantil a la hora actual de los cambios entre empresas socialistas del estado y hacer incomprensible en el plano te rico la naturaleza de las compras y ventas efectuadas entre empresas estatales la naturaleza de la moneda de los precios de la contabilidad econ mica de la autonom a financiera etc estas categor as se encuentran as privadas de todo contenido social real aparecen como formas abstractas o procedimientos t cnicos m s o menos arbitrarios y no como la expresi n de estas leyes econ mica objetivas cuya necesidad destacaba por otra parte el propio stalin
7365523 de esto dimana la imposibilidad de proceder de manera satisfactoria es decir eficaz en un reparto integral a priori de los medios de producci n y de los productos en general la necesidad del comercio socialista y de los organismos comerciales del estado de donde se origina tambi n el papel de la moneda al interior mismo del sector socialista el papel de la ley del valor y un sistema de precios que debe reflejar no solamente el costo social de los diferentes producto sino tambi n expresar las relaciones entre la oferta y la demanda de estos productos y asegurar eventualmente el equilibrio de esta oferta y esta demanda cuando el plan no ha podido asegurarlo a priori y cuando el empleo de medidas administrativas para realizar este equilibrio comprometer a el desarrollo de las fuerzas productivas
7365524 negamos la posibilidad del uso consciente de la ley del valor basados en la no existencia de un mercado libre que exprese autom ticamente la contradicci n entre productores y consumidores negamos la existencia de la categor a mercanc a en la relaci n entre empresas estatales y consideramos todos los establecimientos como parte de la nica gran empresa que es el estado aunque en la pr ctica no sucede todav a as en nuestro pa s
7365525 est n ligadas en un estado dado de las fuerzas productivas
7365526 la planificaci n centralizada es el modo de ser de la sociedad socialista

7365561 i have been playing world of war craft for one year and a half playing games has become my strong desire that pushes me in front of the computer screen every time i am free
7365562 can be seen at every single corner of shanghai or beijing and the fact that china becomes one of the biggest online game markets is totally understandable
7365563 it was so funny that the first time when i started to play online game i looked around in the internet shop and imitated a small boy sitting next to me to take a microphone and talk to my partners all are men
7365564 it was because im female i was a bit angry with those guys and immediately search a voice changer online luckily i found one my god my voice totally became male voice and i was able to play world of warcraft with those guys until i came to level 35 then i decided to talk to them that i was a girl wow they were shocked and we are close friends in the group now
7365565 i can spend 3 hours per day for online games but my major interest is very traditional shopping clothes and books

7365581 desperta muita paix o porque j temos uma estatal do petr leo
7365582 aqui se a decis o for pela cria o de uma estatal vai ser uma empresa criada em lei com um quadro definido em lei e pessoal selecionado por concurso
7365583 o papel da petrobras certamente ser importante e ela vai precisar de recursos para fazer a explora o
7365584 o que n o se pode interditar um debate como esse no pa s

7365592 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7365593 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7365744 the east timorese are not members of the pacific islands forum and thats the first point that needs to be made
7365745 secondly we have sought to respond to the immediate needs of australias fruit growing industry and we have done that in a responsible consultative way
7365746 im looking forward to the discussions with the east timorese well work this through but the scheme as we announced it at the niue pacific island forum summit is as it stands
7365747 we are prosecuting a vigorous program for indigenous employment across australia
7365748 in terms of the order of magnitude lets put this into context 2 500 positions across three years from four participating states from the south pacific is one thing
7365749 if these issues remain in this order going in november obama wins nevada its that simple
7365750 what has to happen is the more republican type issues have to increase in importance or voters have to feel mccain is better trusted on those issues if the war on terror goes up into the double digits thats probably good news for mccain in nevada
7365751 they are blaming and assessing the blame for the current economic downturn on the current administration
7365752 a lot of voters are blaming republicans and mccain is assuming some of that blame
7365753 my plan is not going to bring about economic disaster we already have economic disaster from john mccains president george w bush
7365754 and hes been so tied to the bush administration that i think its guilt by association
7365755 mccain hasnt spent as much time talking about sustaining the tax cuts and the housing problem and the gas price issue as he should
7365756 but i think as it ends up the economy will be a stronger issue for mccain than obama
7365757 at the end of it when you boil all the fanfare away barack obama is for raising taxes
7365758 oh hes fine i had him up last night physically hes ok

7365764 not so long ago the movies whatever their simplifications and distortions still rested on the assumption that their function was to present some intelligible structured image of reality on the simplest level to tell a story and to entertain but more generally to extend the spectators meaningful experience to offer him a window on the real world
7365765 what are they now icebergs of a sort they take things that dont belong together charge them up with hidden meanings and then unite them in a juxtaposition that is bound to shock the spectator into a lubricated state of mind where he is forced to think seriously about the phony implications of what he is seeing
7365766 his legacy includes a school of estranged clown fish intellectual ineffectuals a vivid communication of mucking about a good eye for damp villas in the suburbs an ability to turn any actress into a doll part of the decor some great still shots that have an irascible energy an endless supply of lists
7365767 i think that i shall never see scenes with more sleep provoking powers or hear so many big words that tell me nothing or be an audience to film writing which gets to the heart of an idea and hangs in there or be so edified by the sound and sight of decent noble words spoken with utter piety
7365768 in short no other filmmaker has so consistently made me feel like a stupid ass

7365799 it signalled a degree of return to normality and recovery that everyone here understood immediately we had stopped reviewing restaurants critically since hurricane katrina because we felt it was impossible for the restaurants with their staff shortages and limited facilities to achieve the standards our critic would apply now we have decided that the restaurant scene is robust enough to withstand critiquing the new york times wrote a piece about it which shows they understood how much a bread and butter issue like that means to the city
7365800 many houses slowly rot still bearing on their walls the painted marks left by the us military to show whether corpses were inside
7365801 i dont think we are on peoples minds we have to contend with those voices particularly on pop radio which say new orleanians with their eternal whining why dont they pull themselves up by their boot straps it cuts both ways we are regarded with distrust because we do these strange things like mardi gras and we have far too much fun which seems un american and that produces resentment there is also a deep well of affection for the place as we see from the volunteers who have come here in their thousands to help the rebuilding
7365802 katrina is and will be a defining moment of our lives a story well be telling till the day we die
7365803 i wondered a year and a half ago whether there would ever come a time when the word hurricane or katrina would not appear on or near page one
7365804 the two themes we heard were be patient and do not expect too much for several years and the other was dont expect government to be the generator of your recovery because you will be disappointed
7365805 thats been true of the federal government which although it did provide quite a bit of funds was deplorable in getting them to the people and it was right about the amount of volunteerism which one would normally discount as nice but insufficient but has proved tremendous
7365806 we have not so much changed in the degree of our localness but the paper has changed in intensity and relevance because so much was at stake the very survival of the community was hanging in the balance
7365807 before katrina there were colleagues in the newsroom who were sceptical of the value of the internet but then even the most dinosaurish realised this was the only way to reach scattered readers it changed our owners view of the website too because suddenly we went from 700 000 page views to 30 million over night it was a sea change for us

7365810 its just finished its eighth year ive had people say that its the longest running single presented programme in terms of hours on tv
7365811 the shows unique selling point is that its a public access tv show tv execs id met from other channels didnt have the bottle to give the public the chance to give theirviews unhindered with no delay
7365812 it has demonstrated that the great british public is far from being a bunch of dimwits who have to be told how to decorate christmas trees as is the case on many daytime shows they are actually articulate andpassionate about a wide range of issues from high politics to dumb low pop culture
7365813 its absolutely crucial one of the things i pride myself on is that because we can turn things round very quickly we dont have a huge budget to spend on special effects and sending reporters to do ludicrous and unnecessary live broadcasts we can get discussions on air 24 hours before the bbc with all their resources
7365814 we are disproportionately abc1 we also have a surprisingly high male audience even though we actively court women when i address the audience we nearly always refer to you ladies you girls you women and never talk directly to fellas yet the audience is almost 50 50
7365815 i think hes benefited enormously because he doesnt appear to be totally on message he does things which the blue rinse brigade might find shocking such as taking herbal viagra live on the show
7365816 my fridays were nudging 21 hours in duration i was also doing prerecorded interviews during the week and i just cant keep up that kind of schedule and do all the other work as well it had to go and im absolutely gutted about it as is radio 2 controller lesley douglas i believe
7365817 im hoping that its not the end ofmy relationship with radio 2 just a bit of scaling down at the moment
7365818 the wright stuff is to all intents and purposes a phone in show on television theres a natural link between that and radio work im an arts graduate i did a drama degree and my interests are ballet drama and rock nroll the weekender gave me an opportunity to show a bit of my knowledge and it was a show im extremely proud of
7365819 the motorbikes are all quite slow im a chugger not a racer my best friend was killed when i was 21 and that killed off the race element for me
7365820 the whip round editor richard wallace organised for me was vouchers for a fly fishing shop so i bought all the kit and set about learning it from a book i jokingly say to people that it saved my life because when my marriage hit the rocks i had something else to focus on it has changed my life i just love the nature the beauty
7365821 i have never been part of that journalism clique because i was a child actor and in my heart of hearts i have always wanted to do the entertainment
7365822 although tv is just as intense the intensity isnt as prolonged it also comes more naturally to me i dont want to say the word easy but i dont find it stressful i find it enjoyable
7365823 if you think im working hard think of what piers is doing now he has a tv career on both sides of the atlantic he writes newspaper and magazine columns goes to every showbiz party going and writes best selling books but hes bored all the time because hes so used toworking at this manic rate he never used to get stressed out by the mania
7365824 any minute now i expect the cold hand of reality to grab me by the scruff of the neck march me down to the basement car park and slam my nuts repeatedly in the glove compartment of the company jag
7365825 i never realised you could spend a million bucks in k mart
7365826 its a wonder cornbury the big chill and the rest havent cancelled out of sheer embarrassment
7365827 i saw the big chill had put in their programme that the festival song was deadly accurate but they took it in good spirit
7365828 it was written about people like us and our friends who are over the idea of going to a festival and getting filthy the idea of going in relative comfort to a nice boutique festival where no one gets too dirty and your tent doesnt get stolen and no one gets beaten up gets more attractive the older you get
7365829 apart from not actually getting commissioned i was very happy about all of it
7365830 id sort of been doing the contents of the show for a couple of years and putting them on the internet so i was pretty happy that it all sort of worked but from bbc 3s point of view it wasnt the kind of show that they are making there anymore and it just didnt feel right for them
7365831 its fantastic though i havent quite worked out what my position is to being over there
7365832 ricky gervais always goes on about how brilliant it is i bumped into russell brand this week at heathrow and when he went to buy something the place was buzzing kids looked like theyd met father christmas it was like hed sprinkled celebrity dust in his wake
7365833 if you are like jesus christ you know weve got a chance here you cant drop the ball dont mess up know what i mean this is your big break now its no good
7365834 and weve had so many big breaks that have come and gone now weve relaxed in a much more enjoyable way
7365835 you really see it with a stand up comedian i always remember watching stewart lee when he was young and very vain and he had his hair teased over his head and i enjoyed it much less than i do now where he clearly doesnt care less if a stand up comedian is nervous and uptight it infects the whole crowd immediately and you can hear that on the radio as well
7365836 im not sure theres much further we could go really than doing this
7365837 possibly go to a bigger radio station with a bigger audience were never going to be like jo wiley and zane lowe wed just say something terrible its hard enough doing it just once a week its a full time job to just do that one thing and really nail it
7365838 i think to be a really successful presenter you have to know how to lie well or to do what your bosses tell you to do to promote the other shows on the station it is dangerous not to do that and stupid and bad for your career we go out of our way not to so you try and be honest about stuff and then you open up a huge yawning chasm of doom
7365839 now that they have put the great back into britain
7365840 can we all remember just how fantastic this country and its people are
7365841 lets wrap ourselves in the flag not only for the homecoming parade on 16 october but every day
7365842 a senior cabinet minister told colleagues yesterday to avoid the impression of jostling to succeed gordon brown
7365843 an automatic deathtrap used to use them in the old days as a final fuck you zaps everything in its path really messes you up if youve got your sensory gain turned up high like a prying hacker might this is one of the worst ive seen couldve killed you these guys are old school
7365844 just rigged to go off whenever the doors are opened but thats insane itd be dangerous to anyone wanting to come in
7365845 please continue you havent failed the test yet and this is a bad place to stop
7365846 jesus theres thousands of them passwords as well why would they possibly need access to hundreds thousands of ordinary home machines
7365847 but when you put them all together it looks like i was right the irish have been taking a great deal of money from a private customer in exchange for preparing some kind of battle plan this place seems less like an archive and more like a weapons stockpile let me see if i can trace these accounts back to any single source
7365848 as soon as youre done alex please take a closer look at the island i think i know whats going on there as well
7365849 just curious it was only a scan it cant hurt you right
7365850 faeries dont like being scanned we dont like people who try to scan us either
7365851 i think were in big trouble youd better get down here
7365852 offensive capabilities as well this isnt security this is an army
7365853 sorry alex it was necessary seems ive underestimated this whole place these faeries are the next best thing to true artificial intelligence and there are dozens running on this low end system that means any system in the world is vulnerable to them and an owner might never even know it was infiltrated until the agent carried out its mission
7365854 you made mistakes a cowboy needs to know the old tricks as well as the new ones
7365855 on the other hand ive seen worse and i got some good intel out of it those faeries are a big discovery ive talked to some friends in luxembourg and they think these things are the same agents used to attack the european communications grid
7365856 furthermore ive checked out the accounts that have been pumping money into ireland behind all the hundreds of diversions and smokescreens they all seem to belong to one man does the name gabriel lowell mean anything to you
7365857 oh very well then im telling you now when it comes time to put forth your application you will have my full support in the fifteen
7365858 ill pop out and do a couple of questions on it for you all the other journalists have got this number so you might as well use it
7365859 im going to invite onto the programme everyone who hates me
7365860 i said ill do a deal first half hour you can ask me anything you want and the second half hour i can ask you anything i want he wouldnt do it
7365861 i would question him about his role in the death of dr david kelly i remember hearinghis controversial piece on the today programme it was quite early but my kids had woken up i heard him mention a senior intelligence source and i immediately thought one of the top ten people in mi6 has grassed up the government it turns out to be poor old david kelly basically what gilligan did was what has destroyed so many otherwise good coppers theyve caught a criminal but they havent got the evidence so they falsify the evidence if gilligan hadnt distorted what kelly had said grossly exaggerated it kelly would be alive today
7365862 i told him to his face youve been responsible for one persons death stay away from my family get off my doorstep
7365863 i knew because i was mayor that the met were not investigating this
7365864 and so farewell to happy days theres no more cash for londons gays
7365865 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7365866 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7365867 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate
7365868 the mayor of shanghai is flying me out for a conference in november aboutcity economics im doing the keynote speech about what i think the future is for shanghai and the government of hong kong has got me going out to discuss the environment
7365869 oh yes kens junket to shanghai to have exotic discussions about the growth of international financial centres
7365870 i just think boris is mad not to havegone that opening ceremony i suspect was the most extravagant spectacle in human history it was stunning to watch and im glad i went
7365871 youd got headlines saying suicide bomb backer runs kens campaign followed by kens adviser is linked to terror group which came as news to him the adviser as he had the second highest clearance for mi5 because he is the auditor for the ministry of defence then they said boris was the new messiah people came to the conclusion that it wasnt balanced reporting
7365872 every black person who worked for me was acrook and every asian was a terrorist was the broad theme
7365873 somebody inside the building broke into lee jaspers computer and downloaded eight years of letters and emails
7365874 how are you going to prove it by the time we knew there was no chance of finding anyones fingerprints it had most probably happened weeks if not months before the standard started using it
7365875 i particularly like the londonpaper because they set out to have a paper thats positive about london whereas if the only thing you knew about london was from the evening standard you wouldnt come here for fear of being mugged raped or ripped off its all doom like the daily mail
7365876 lord rothermere came to see me and i told him that i aimed to get the maximum amount for it and that if somebody else bids more than you do theyll get it i suspect a lot of the venom was because of their paranoid fear that i would try and rig the thing the reality is that its no great shakes to me whether its run by rothermere or rupert murdoch neither are going to be particularly progressive i was going to have an auction on the internet for the rights
7365877 we got three times what we expected we got so much more than we expected that we didnt need a bus fare increase this year
7365878 when i first got really interested in politics in the sixties all the quality papers had an entire page reporting mps speeches there would be the single salient point that was most important in a speech in the paper the next morning
7365879 when the media followed murdoch down the electronic route we were promised that the savings would mean more extensive foreign coverage and everywhere there is less than there was
7365880 there are people who never did anything and im not terribly interested in their opinions i dont want to pick out anybody but catherine bennett of the observer would be a good start why is anyone interested in her opinions has she written great literature produced great art work run a major corporation been elected to office or is she just paid to produce bile
7365881 you might as well pop into the local pub and say whats your opinion its equally valid
7365882 over the last three months the only place you could get really good coverage of city hall was on the blogs
7365883 they havent got off their backsides and logged on to answer all this right wing drivel
7365884 its a 24 7 job if boris had told londoners what he proposed to do which was to appoint tim parker to do the job i was doing whilst he went back to writing his quarter of a million pound column for the telegraph he wouldnt have been elected
7365885 estamos encantados de reunir el mensaje con su emisor al due o con esta pieza de la historia
7365886 an inquest is an important public occasion the power to ban reporters from inquests could be used in all sorts of cases to halt the reporting of embarrassing stories for the government or the armed forces
7365887 there are already procedures in place to hold hearings in camera appointing someone who will be seen as a government stooge is no way of ensuring that the justice system is free and fair
7365888 respecting freedoms for our press the removal of barriers to investigative journalism respecting the public right to know
7365889 served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest
7365890 to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest
7365891 disclosures of information are penalised even where they are not harmful to national security
7365892 appeared in a photospread in gq wearing a pair of red knickers and a teeny tiny vest
7365893 por cada 500 c lulas madre embrionarias podr amos tener unos cinco millones de eritrocitos
7365894 aqu hay 14 millones de personas es normal que antes de encontrar a los cinco millones de personas que hablan un poco de ingl s se tropiece con los otros millones
7365895 los seres cibern ticos los nuevos compa eros de hombre deben estar recubiertos de componentes electr nicos para medir la temperatura presi n y otros factores ambientales con el fin de vivir en armon a con los humanos
7365896 i have seen his passion and determination his grit and grace and i know that he has lived the american dream
7365897 been on the front lines for social and economic justice
7365898 vladimir tods is a vampire or at least sort of hes not quite sure
7365899 a tree branch slapped john craig across the face scraping his skin but he kept on running and ignored the stabbing of pine needles on his bare feet
7365900 no hemos decidido todav a qu opci n se tomar no estamos de acuerdo con la derogatoria as que dif cilmente la vamos a promulgar
7365901 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7365902 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7365903 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7365904 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7365905 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7365906 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7365907 we understand the essence of the russian position and its military response
7365908 theyre all seriously worried that its georgia today and one of them tomorrow
7365909 poland and the us signed a deal to build a controversial missile defence shield in eastern europe
7365910 the agreement highlights how russias invasion of georgia has prompted a swift reappraisal of the regions security and alliances the us and poland have been talking about the missile shield for a year but rushed to cement their alliance in the wake of this weeks conflict
7365911 tried and failed just before leaving for europe on monday 7 july to seal a deal to place missiles in poland the state department said
7365912 the statements of some nato representatives that the maneuvers of the alliances ships in the black sea were planned a year ago are evidence that attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia were planned earlier maybe even last year
7365913 now that the conflict with south ossetia is exhausted there are nato vessels in the black sea what for and with what aim
7365914 i thought they would kill us i was very much afraid
7365915 georgian units are concentrated in the central part of the republic and are preparing for further actions
7365916 georgian special forces are setting up arms caches in order among other things to carry out provocations on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
7365917 doctors cant tell me how they died i was only told their bodies were picked up on the road by russian troops and delivered here to tskhinvali morgue but its very mysterious
7365918 other journalists have joined us here our friends from ap reuters france press and time are here now and we all see it as our duty to complete this
7365919 working conditions for journalists were terrible of all the war conflicts in the post soviet space and the balkans this was the worst time for journalists
7365920 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7365921 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7365922 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7365923 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7365924 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7365925 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7365926 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7365927 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7365928 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7365929 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7365930 solidaridad con lo afectados por la tragedia descansen en paz las v ctimas
7365931 es un palo importante del que nos vamos a recuperar enseguida comienza la liga cogemos fuerzas hay que sacar conclusiones positivas y ser optimistas dentro nos vamos a fortalecer tenemos que levantarnos y aprender es una herida que va a cicatrizar
7365932 se pusieron las cosas favorables por el resultado y por tener dos jugadores m s sobre el campo pero el real madrid ha encontrado una fuerza que se la ha dado su estadio exigi ndose m s en inferioridad se han encontrado con los goles
7365933 nosotros no hemos sabido estar unidos para atacar mejor felicito al real madrid y nosotros aprendemos para el futuro es un palo para los jugadores y para todo el valencia hay que darle m rito al rival por su fuerza y su fe
7365934 en el descanso quer amos mantener la misma l nea tener el bal n y asegurarlo nos hemos encontrado con dos jugadores m s en una situaci n favorable en el campo pero esa fuerza que deb amos tener esa organizaci n no la hemos tenido la han encontrado ellos y hemos tenido una p jara importante
7365935 porque tuvimos una buena ventaja que pudimos mantener ahora cada uno hace una autocr tica de lo que tenemos que corregir
7365936 que nos alcancen y nos vuelvan a ganar como tambi n sucedi en casa donde hab amos conseguido ir ganando que es lo m s importante y no hemos podido mantener el resultado
7365937 es un malentendido as lo entiendo yo porque cuando t vienes a entrenar y te dicen a qu hora y no asistes s es un incumplimiento pero hubo unos malos entendidos
7365938 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7365939 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7365940 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7365941 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7365942 la rotura de ligamentos interno y cruzado anterior de la rodilla derecha
7365943 una primera decisi n que hemos tomado para profundizar la revoluci n deportiva es la creaci n de una oficina para el deporte de alto rendimiento donde los deportistas puedan ir y hacer sus planteamientos y para hacer asambleas para o r sus opiniones
7365944 algunos se hicieron falsas expectativas sobre nuestra participaci n en beijing
7365945 y nosotros fuimos a pelear por estar en lo m s alto de podio estar entre las medallas sin embargo no se lograron los objetivos
7365946 analizar la situaci n del deporte porque son los atletas los que la conocen realmente
7365947 mucho la verdad no conocemos m s bien estamos pensando en lo que podamos hacer nosotros va a ser un partido bastante importante y esperemos hacer bien las cosas para sacar un buen resultado
7365948 no sabemos c mo puedan pararse c mo puedan llegar hay muchas cosas que pueden ser contraproducentes si ellos no nos conocen puede ser dif cil para los dos equipos pero nosotros pensamos en lo que hagamos venga el rival que venga y durante el partido uno se va dando cuenta de c mo se va presentando todo
7365949 hay que tratar de sumar nuevamente una victoria jugando de local para ir ganando m s confianza durante cada partido que vayamos disputando ser a muy bueno si jugamos un partido de estas caracter sticas ganar por una diferencia de goles y m s que hoy el cruz azul est teniendo mucha llegada si concretamos todas van a ser importante
7365950 el rival no lo conozco tampoco s c mo va este campeonato pero s que cruz azul es un equipo grande y hay que buscar los partidos hay que ser protagonistas para lograr el campeonato que ser a muy lindo para ellos
7365951 adem s se van a querer mostrar los belice os van a ir a jugar a un gran estadio contra un gran equipo y a cualquier le pasar a que quiere hacer buenos partidos nosotros debemos estar atentos a que no pase eso y hacer el juego que queremos para sacar un buen resultado
7365952 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7365953 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7365954 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7365955 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7365956 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7365957 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7365958 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7365959 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7365960 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7365961 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7365962 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7365963 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7365964 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7365965 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7365966 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7365967 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7365968 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7365969 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7365970 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7365971 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7365972 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7365973 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7365974 sometimes it kind of gets aggravating to know that fayetteville has something so beautiful and the folks that are on it dont want to take care of it
7365975 so we want to look and research that first and then plan an event
7365976 and hopefully it will become as our citywide cleanups have been an annual event as well
7365977 anything i could do for the cape fear river id love to do it
7365978 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7365979 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7365980 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7365981 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7365982 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7365983 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7365984 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7365985 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7365986 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7365987 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7365988 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7365989 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7365990 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7365991 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7365992 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7365993 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7365994 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7365995 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7365996 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7365997 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7365998 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7365999 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7366000 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7366001 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7366002 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7366003 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7366004 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7366005 who are open to doing something on the production side
7366006 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7366007 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7366008 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7366009 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7366010 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7366011 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7366012 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7366013 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7366014 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7366015 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7366016 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7366017 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7366018 while trekkers have had a number of big screen delights who fans are hoping that the success of the new incarnation of doctor who will see it make the jump to a cinema near them
7366019 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7366020 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7366021 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7366022 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7366023 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7366024 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
7366025 this is going to force them to make the ps3 last longer and theyre kind of positioning to do that
7366026 we used to have this thing about stress being bad but what we call eustress literally meaning good stress has positive benefits it comes from doing things like exercise sex or meeting a challenge physically it improves your respiration lowers blood pressure and heart rate and your levels of endorphins hormones which make you feel good are raised
7366027 it can be really beneficial as a way of getting out of that black hole
7366028 just by going to a sunny resort like gozo and having a relaxing time your psoriasis would be improved
7366029 sunlight has been shown to improve psoriasis and lessening stress can also help however the condition is made worse by the penetration of irritants into the skin so massage with oils would prevent this happening

7366036 roxies way of coping is to go out and surround herself with friends sams is to stay at home
7366037 everyone says how terrible it must be for roxie losing her twin but its just as hard for sam who was also very close to jodie
7366038 at sport and riding she always showed determination and a lack of fear
7366039 she applied those same qualities to coping with her illness she never complained never said why me nor did she show any jealousy of roxie being able to have a normal life michelle and rob had no idea jodies would die so soon after the above picture was taken having an identical twin it was in her face the whole time that roxie had everything but she was only bad tempered a few times when the chemo made her feel awful
7366040 so i took her to the doctor who referred her for an mri scan
7366041 it was wonderful that rob rox and sam were able to visit clic allowed us to stay together
7366042 in the easter holidays jo began getting terrible back pain a scan revealed that the cancer had returned grown and contaminated some lymph nodes on april 29 we were told that she could have more chemotherapy to prolong her life but the cancer was terminal we chose not to tell jo because we didnt want to take away all hope
7366043 we thought jo had an inkling because the pain was returning
7366044 it was a terrible shock to us to find out how much of a shock it was to her that was one of the few times she cried she wasnt afraid of death she thought you became a star but she didnt want to leave her friends
7366045 she decided who to leave which piece of jewellery to and wrote lovely letters to her friends telling them individually that they had been the best friends anyone could want she asked them to keep smiling and said she would be watching them
7366046 she also planned her own memorial service which we held at newton abbot racecourse where jodie had always been good at picking winners no flowers because she wanted the money donated to clic everyone was to come in bright colours she wanted to celebrate the wonderful life she had had her message was that everyone should make the most of theirs
7366047 early that afternoon we played ordinary people by john legend one of the songs she had chosen for her memorial service when it was finished she asked rob and i to hold her up and sam and roxie to hold her hands then she just passed away it couldnt have been more peaceful

7366108 he emailed on friday night and said he took some fantastic photos
7366109 they left us this morning to visit internally displaced camps on the outskirts of mogadishu
7366110 they are nowhere to be found they were to visit parts of lower shabelle region
7366111 knowing nigel i think he would be very together and the rock holding the group together
7366112 those who want to transact business with us are always very suspicious
7366113 the nigerian government frowns very seriously on these scams and every day tries to track down those who are involved
7366114 it is not in the character of nigerians to be engaged in this kind of scam
7366115 we cant control our own citizens so if you fall for their crud tough on you
7366116 provide your bank account details in order for us to transfer the proceeds of the dead nigerians proceeds of crime

7366119 is what they chose to whip out then there was a particular point i loved the punch a couple of flam a diddles on the high toms from spanky backed by the bass groves of mike there went brandon on lead guitar they totally crunched
7366120 the only band in the entire pnw i have heard with vocals like this is portlands miss anne thrope mats frontman
7366121 tour with a gal from india have i heard those sounds which reminded me of summers with the krishnas

7366131 o my gosh shes exploring same sex attractions she must be a lesbian
7366132 girls making out with each other to turn on guys is the latest craze at high school and college parties
7366133 and the kissing itself didnt really bug me from then on it became a normal thing to do
7366134 youre turning on a guy and he thinks its cool
7366135 the term for the im straight but ill kiss girls mentality is heteroflexible
7366136 theyre doing it because they want to appeal to boys their age and for boys their age whove developed sexually alongside internet porn their sexual cues are affected by the norms and standards of porn and thats girl on girl action
7366137 the joint has been infiltrated by a gaggle of giggling straight girls playing gay for a night because it amuses them
7366138 difficult to distinguish between the behavior of someone who is legitimately sexually interested and someone who wants to impress the boy across the room
7366139 a lot of girls who do want long term boyfriends will still settle for the hookup triggered by girl on girl kissing because it gives them that temporary feeling of being taken care of and being close to someone
7366140 i guess tea at no 10 is out of question i ask police guy cheekily

7366158 i have had a traumatic weekend i had a few problems health wise but seemed to pull through i just woke up very early yesterday and i had a spasm in my neck fortunately ive got a great doctor it was so bad that i was struggling to stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers
7366159 at the start i was on the dirty side i got a reasonable start but nowhere near as quick as felipe i had to hold my spot and robert kubica was pushing quite hard for a couple of corners i was trying to keep up with felipe but it was pretty hard to overtake here

7366168 unless we want to lose the 20 billion economy of the shore and do it for a lot less energy than wed get for pursuing the renewable energy tax credits then i think drilling doesnt make a lot of sense
7366169 the public has a right to know keeping it secret is not our place no matter how devastating the knowledge might be
7366170 this kind of knowledge could cause a panic its not faith specific were talking widespread shock if we revealed what weve discovered to the public wed have a psychotic town on our hands
7366171 the sensible wouldnt believe it if we said something denial is a powerful tool this kind of knowledge is perspective shattering
7366172 if we came forward those sane enough not to lose their minds would just deny it ignore it or anything else they could do not to face the truth of it
7366173 i cant carry it with me anymore this sort of knowledge eats at a man they have a right to know they have a right to know
7366174 but what can we do its simply our responsibility to carry this with us
7366175 you cant and i know it i know you were in this together or we arent in it at all thats why you called me down here to begin with if you wanted to come forward with what weve discovered on your own youd have done it already

7366193 huub rothengatter red is bezig met een aantal opties onze voorkeur gaat nog steeds uit naar de champcar en daarnaast liggen er dus mogelijkheden voor de 24 uursrace van le mans maar we wachten rustig af
7366194 hij is heel koel heel relaxed hij weet eigenlijk niet beter
7366195 het is geweldig om de snelste in de lmp2 klasse te zijn hier tijdens mijn eerste keer op le mans
7366196 ik had wel het geluk om als enige van ons team op een droge baan te kunnen rijden al met al waren de condities vandaag erg lastig we wilden geen onnodig risico nemen en de auto beschadigen met al deze regen hebben we niet zoveel kunnen rijden als we hadden gehoopt maar daar maak ik me geen zorgen over want ik weet uit de le mans series dat de rs spyder een geweldige raceauto is ik kan nauwelijks wachten tot mijn eerste le mans race
7366197 zon auto dat heb ik nog nooit meegemaakt hij blijft maar gaan
7366198 ik kan niks negatiefs bedenken over de auto die auto blijft maar rijden ongelooflijk

7366200 ik ken michel perridon af en toe roept hij iets waar hij een week later weer spijt van heeft dat maakt me niet zo heel veel uit moet ik zeggen hij is niet de enige persoon waar we mee bezig zijn hij is ook niet de enige sponsor op de wereld we kunnen nog alle kanten op we zien we nog wel wat er allemaal gebeurt
7366201 ja dat is ook zo maar dat is over twee weken opgelost eigenlijk is er dus niets aan de hand
7366202 de contacten zijn er zeker huub rothengatter heeft drie dagen op het circuit rondgelopen en alle teams die hij wilde spreken gesproken hij heeft ook de grote mannen van de organisatie gesproken het is nog te vroeg om iets te zeggen het champ car seizoen is nog volop bezig en het nieuwe seizoen begint in april dus we hebben nog een maand of zeven ik maak me nu nog niet zo druk hoor
7366203 ja natuurlijk wil ik mijn carri re op een fatsoenlijke manier afsluiten maar ik loop niet gefrustreerd rond met in mijn hoofd dat moet dat moet ik heb het idee dat andere mensen zich daar drukker over maken dan ikzelf er kan nog zoveel op mijn pad komen le mans kun je ook nog tot je 50e rijden dus waar maken we ons nu eigenlijk druk om
7366204 michel had me nodig met mijn ervaring moest ik de zaken in de champ cars goed gaan opzetten het klonk allemaal heel positief uit alles bleek dat hij succes wilde hebben in de champ cars trust wil de amerikaanse markt vervoveren en niet achteraan rijden perridon had ook huub rothengatter red nodig voor de zakelijke aspecten het kon iets heel moois worden daar in amerika en ineens hoor ik dat hij gp2 wil gaan rijden in het voorprogramma van de formule 1
7366205 jos verdient een mooi afscheid hij is een raceheld maar ik moet ook zeggen dat ik twijfels heb over de fysieke gesteldheid van jos ik begrijp dat hij erg veel last van zijn nek heeft daar eigenlijk ook aan geholpen moet worden zelfs huub rothengatter heeft tegen mij gezegd te twijfelen of jos daardoor wel op zijn oude niveau kan terugkeren zulke risicos wil ik niet nemen
7366206 vanwege het weer konden we op de testdag helaas niet het volledige programma afwerken dat we hadden gepland
7366207 porsche heeft de rs spyder speciaal voor le mans op een aantal punten aangepast en de resultaten waren veelbelovend
7366208 de finish halen is ons doel en een zo goed mogelijk resultaat in onze klasse
7366209 ik verheug me op mijn eerste race met de porsche rs spyder
7366210 ik wist dat er nog meer inzat en als dat dan lukt is het helemaal top en eigenlijk zat er ook nu nog m r in maar we zijn meer dan tevreden
7366211 de lagere temperaturen zorgen voor een betere koeling van de motor daarbij houden de banden het ook langer vol sterker nog je hebt m r grip
7366212 de jongens van het team hebben echt hun best gedaan met het verwisselen van de motor anders hadden we het niet gered vanavond dan hadden we misschien nog wel eerste gestaan maar niet met zon grote voorsprong
7366213 dit is voor hen een geweldig evenement en ik ben er helemaal klaar voor
7366214 ik heb het zo naar mn zin gehad in die auto echt geweldig de porsche is perfect om mee te rijden het voelt allemaal heel goed aan we hebben met zn allen goed kunnen werken tijdens deze test en de samenwerking binnen het team is uitstekend
7366215 de samenwerking binnen het team verloopt prima en de aanpak is heel professioneel er wordt werkelijk niets aan het toeval overgelaten en dat is een erg plezierige manier van werken de porsche is heel comfortabel om mee te rijden je hebt het als rijder helemaal niet zwaar en dat is voor lange afstandsraces perfect
7366216 ik kijk met grote tevredenheid terug op deze test het verliep allemaal zonder problemen en dat geeft heel veel vertrouwen
7366217 mede dankzij de coaching en begeleiding van jeroen en jos heb ik mezelf een flink stuk kunnen verbeteren en hun prestaties spreken voor zich
7366218 we kijken terug op een uitermate succesvolle sessie waarin is gebleken dat het team en de rijders er goed bij staan er is onderling goed samengewerkt en de rijders vullen elkaar prima aan de coaching door jos en jeroen is voor peter waardevol je ziet dat hij de adviezen goed omzet
7366219 de porsche rs spyder is een heel goede auto en ik heb alle vertrouwen in het team ik kijk dan ook erg uit naar deze nieuwe opgave
7366220 ik verheug me erop om komend seizoen weer te kunnen racen en dan natuurlijk vooral in de 24 uur van le mans dat is voor iedere coureur een hoogtepunt
7366221 het rijden van lange afstandsraces met pitstops en rijderswissels is helemaal nieuw voor mij en ik zal dan ook nog veel moeten leren maar ik heb er alle vertrouwen in dat dat gaat lukken porsche is natuurlijk een fantastisch merk met jarenlange ervaring en enorme successen in de autosport en ook het team bestaat uit mensen die weten hoe het op dit niveau werkt dus wat dat betreft zijn alle factoren aanwezig
7366222 jeroen bleekemolen is voor mij echt de coming man van dit moment terwijl we met jos verstappen niet alleen een grote naam in huis hebben maar ook iemand die zijn sporen in de autosport heeft verdiend qua ervaring kan ik natuurlijk niet aan hen tippen maar ze hebben me allebei beloofd dat ze mij mee zullen trekken en ik zal er van mijn kant natuurlijk alles aan doen om qua conditie en snelheid zo goed mogelijk te presteren

7366225 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved

7366325 en biden obama eligi a un senador conocido por su experiencia en asuntos internacionales pero tambi n por su destreza en el combate pol tico
7366326 si obama pretende sanear la cultura pol tica de washington ha elegido como su escudero una eminencia gris no un rostro nuevo
7366327 comparado con obama a quien a menudo se describe como calmado y cerebral el senador joe biden es directo y desenfadado
7366328 obama dice que representa un nuevo tipo de pol tica no partidista pero ha hecho una selecci n tradicional de compa ero de f rmula
7366329 biden es en muchos sentidos lo que obama no es tiene experiencia es conocedor de asuntos exteriores y es cat lico
7366330 quiz y esto es lo m s importante no tiene un pelo de timorato con un historial de clase trabajadora y un estilo aguerrido biden podr a contrarrestar los intentos del partido republicano por pintar a obama como un elitista
7366331 obama se expuso a dos cr ticas la de que est compensando por su poca experiencia tal como george w bush hizo cuando eligi a dick cheney y que la inclusi n de biden socava el argumento de obama seg n el cual la sabidur a es m s importante que la experiencia
7366332 hay que darle cr dito a obama porque no permiti que estas objeciones t cticas le impidieran elegir a un compa ero impresionante

7366335 el hecho de que obama haya elegido a biden sugiere que no le intimidan los colaboradores y consejeros fuertes y conocedores que puedan cuestionar su pensamiento y que asuman tareas importantes
7366336 obama eligi lo seguro m s que lo audaz y la experiencia en lugar del cambio

7366377 it is common that companies change their strategy and will fall away and be replaced
7366378 we started really early back in july 2006 which meant by the time the economy turned we had already secured seven national tier one sponsors
7366379 if the recession deepens it could get tough but we are confident of securing two thirds of the target 650m by march 2009
7366380 we have been retained for eight investigations this year already compared with last year when we did a total of four housing associations are now our second biggest source of work after banks
7366381 what we have found is that they are typically overvalued by about 20pc extrapolating from that we reckon fraud is costing housing associations up to 820m every two years
7366382 as housing associations grow and get more money theres more fraud
7366383 they are less concerned about whether it is the right price
7366384 we always welcome long term shareholders we talk to a number of different shareholders
7366385 turning coal seam gas into money is hard and an lng plant costs 2bn or more
7366386 bg shareholders like the management but are keen to see they dont get carried away the valuation of companies that are extracting coal seam gas hasnt risen recently but gone down
7366387 origins directors simply assert that bg groups all cash offer undervalues the company but there is no evidence or independent experts report to support this view nor is there any forecast or other financial information that could assist shareholders in making a timely and informed decision
7366388 further origin has failed to demonstrate any confidence that the coal seam gas monetisation process will yield superior value for its shareholders
7366389 considered the case fully followed its own procedures observed the relevant law acted fairly and proportionately and without bias and came to a reasonable decision on the basis of the evidence

7366391 it is publicly owned and there is a feeling channel 4 lacks a degree of accountability it doesnt have the accountability to its shareholders that itv does we will act in the role of shareholders
7366392 there will have to be some strings attached we cant just say heres 100m of taxpayers money and you can do what you want with it
7366393 we will need to be convinced of which areas require public money you need to identify where there is clearly a market failure the ones that jump out of the page are childrens and regional programming and current affairs
7366394 a combination of factors have created tough conditions for companies to continue with defined benefit pension schemes
7366395 these include tighter regulation volatile stock market conditions strengthening of longevity assumptions and fears over future developments in accounting for pensions in our survey last year about a quarter or 28pc were still open to new members down from half in 2003
7366396 with the number of final salary schemes plunging to a record low they have now become gold dust for the employees who still have them employers can turn this to their advantage because the schemes give them a competitive edge in the fight to attract and retain talent
7366397 while regulation improved life expectancy and market volatility have all served to increase pressures on employers sponsoring defined benefit pension schemes good scheme design can play a vital role in mitigating their effects

7366406 there is a growing sense of disquiet and in some quarters anger about the recent developments worldwide may be out of control and it is time we asked some fundamental questions about its strategy
7366407 its high risk is taking a punt on production companies an appropriate use of taxpayers money the bbc may be getting into its own version of sub prime lending

7366416 we try to insure people who are well off and comfortable but the recession affects everyone
7366417 if someone else is prepared to do it at a non economical price the best thing is to say no thank you
7366418 we had not renewed it as they wanted a reduction in premium
7366419 i think that the changes to tax with the non domiciles issue and corporate tax over here has made the uk a less competitive place to do business
7366420 is the best place in the world for big ticket or international business

7366422 it is a lot more satisfying to build a business than consult at heart i am a builder not an adviser i do not regret it at all
7366423 this will be of urgent concern for the bank which has stated inflation will fall back below its 2pc target within two years
7366424 if inflation expectations continue to grow bringing down actual price inflation is going to be more difficult people will negotiate for higher pay rises and retailers will try harder to hike prices because the climate is more lenient towards inflation
7366425 this should not be the case right now for a number of reasons
7366426 this reflects the deteriorating outlook for the east asian economies which will reduce the demand for uk exports
7366427 in the last economic downturn there was still a large proportion of blue collar workers who retreated to their local pub to chew over hard times

7366440 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7366441 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7366442 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7366443 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it

7366445 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7366446 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7366447 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7366448 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7366449 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch

7366455 people should not have expected the markets to recover soon we are a year in since the problems first emerged
7366456 we have got big hurdles to overcome at the same time it is a perfect storm severe global inflation that could potentially be around for a number of years and a banking crisis
7366457 we will see tighter lending conditions as banks need to get smaller and we have got a housing market decline where consumers are hugely indebted

7366462 it is clearly stretching the truth to call beijing a disaster for usa track and field it is also stretching the truth to call it a success
7366463 it was a very big goal for me to win this title my
7366464 what is a disaster is that this is normally the busiest weekend of the year for the museum
7366465 this is going to result in a significant financial loss for us august is our busiest month when we always get a lot of visitors from overseas
7366466 our concern was that the corner is supported by a really small amount of brickwork which had come out of place there was a danger the floor above could have collapsed
7366467 she said she was driving down the hill when her brakes failed so rather than shooting across the crossroads she turned and hit the corner of the building
7366468 obviously there can be no excuses for speeding and i can only say that the threat of losing my licence was a wake up call for me which made me much more aware of what speed i am doing i have changed my driving habits but i realise it may be too late

7366477 he has had to work very hard but his drive and determination has helped him

7366479 australian miners are a strong and growing presence in peru with south america identified as a primary target market for australian mining technology products
7366480 there were many deaths during the war of conquest but the major cause of death one that continues today was the rupture of social organisation and the substitution of an economy serving the needs of the people by a colonial economy
7366481 that socio economic reality continues today we are now a colony of multinational companies we have changed masters and products but our people continue to work not for their own benefit but for the master of the day
7366482 the discrepancy between genders can easily be mitigated through importation of females from many other cultures where females are a majority like south america for instance

7366490 the important thing is that the team performed to its full potential everyone says our ferrari engine gives us an advantage over some teams at the moment its strong certainly but it would be unfair to give it all the credit
7366491 it is an honour for me to work at these olympic games
7366492 share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7366493 the story here is more the obama not clinton ticket
7366494 and this was another i braked a little bit early for turn two perhaps because i was keeping an eye on the cars fighting behind but everything felt fine i knew lewis was there but i was pulling away by a couple of tenths every lap the first stint was nothing special really but in the second stint the car felt perfect that won us the race
7366495 but after a couple of laps he felt ok and so resumed his normal programme racing drivers have phenomenal neck muscles so a spasm isnt like it would be for you or i it puts real pressure on one side of the spine
7366496 with two cars going side by side down the pit lane so i would be really surprised to get a penalty because its just racing
7366497 we wouldnt have wanted to win the race that way

7366507 in the past we ve been scheduling two weeks out
7366508 the way we trained for it last time was pretty much spot on but now we have the stories to back it up the there i was kind of experience
7366509 you ll have a couple hours of calm followed by 14 minutes of chaos
7366510 because the fight is essentially the same fight this time just knowing where we re going to live and how we re going to operate is actually a huge load off the minds of first time deployers and their families
7366511 it s really rewarding to get out there and help the army
7366512 anxiety and nightmares take turns taunting him scattered sand and ghosts visit almost every day substance abuse ptsd the diagnosis given to him he cried as he told me this he said do they know
7366513 they came back from the war got discharged and then couldn t find a job we patch them up get them a place to live and do everything we can to get them back on their feet
7366514 on my way to work i stopped at a traffic light
7366515 he winked and smiled weakly at me with all that pain in his hand thank you nurse he said for not passing me by like the others
7366516 my heart bleeds for my patients and their families i store those memories in my heart drying their tears while we cry only in our hearts
7366517 i started writing a poem about the bond formed between a nurse and a wounded soldier and suddenly saw i had 11 poems completed about these heroes
7366518 we read in the papers about someone being wounded and then never hear about them again this book is about what happens next
7366519 we nurses become their mothers their sisters their families when they re crying we re there holding and rocking them
7366520 we re not supposed to cry we were taught in school not to cry to be their stoic helpmates but sometimes you just can t hold it in
7366521 finally i am able to tell it as i see it forever now i can sing my own song i m happy for my missing piece that suddenly awakened look as i stretch and spread my wings
7366522 i m 95 years old that s about the limit i guess if i hadn t got this here i would ve been all right but 62 years is long enough for me
7366523 everyone done me right it was easy to stay nobody bothers you
7366524 the japanese have been very kind to work for i never had any trouble with the japanese they re good mechanics and good workers if it hadn t been for them i probably wouldn t have stayed so long
7366525 we got some bad ones in here we had more trouble than you could shake a stick at during the vietnam war
7366526 the japanese are going more western every day but they ve been real good to me i don t complain whatsoever
7366527 the army s treated me real good too all the officers and enlisted men i ve worked with have been fine i ve worked with a lot of them
7366528 he goes home afterward on tuesday afternoons but he s always back at work by 7 a m the next day
7366529 i live three minutes away and sometimes i ll have a headache and don t feel like going in he drives to dialysis by himself he doesn t ask for special considerations because of the illness
7366530 that s what keeps me going if he can do that and come to work i m coming to work what excuse do i have
7366531 he shows up for work like it s his first year on the job same dedication it s amazing
7366532 i like japan i m gonna retire here that s all i can say
7366533 we knew the school was closing but i still have two years here
7366534 this whole process of the base transition is still being developed
7366535 we tried to put patrick in the local italian school for a few months this past year but he doesn t speak the language he became really unhappy and very introverted it just didn t work
7366536 at the request of the parents dodds e will allow kindergarten through second graders to ride the bus but we do not endorse this as the best option for young children if parents wish to drive their students to naples elementary they may do so
7366537 we were just told of this wednesday so we are able to enroll patrick today
7366538 we made the preparations for you to return safe and secure to your area and your homes
7366539 our hearts are open to you as well as our eyes securing you and we are asking the families to notify us if there is any lack of security in the area
7366540 the lack of services will probably cause tension between the people already there and those moving in and we ll have to deal with that on patrol
7366541 the neighborhood will eventually be better off for it this kind of movement is needed to show the security situation is getting better but now the government has to step up and get these projects moving
7366542 i always try to put some love in the food
7366543 i put on some bob marley and i talk to the guys as i cook we have fun
7366544 after they go on a patrol they need some hot chow and a morale boost
7366545 nowadays the security is better so the girls can play here
7366546 basically we want to give them a reason to stay in school and not join the insurgency
7366547 we re out here every two or three days with another group meeting with them and encouraging them to keep up with their teams
7366548 the challenge isn t getting voting materials to our soldiers but getting soldiers to vote
7366549 many soldiers are not interested in voting any soldier who has access to a computer can access voting materials all bases even the small ones have means to deliver mail
7366550 when they talk about pre deployment checklists most of the lieutenant colonels and colonels say there s way too much on them already
7366551 i wouldn t say voting is a low priority but a difficult priority
7366552 you know what s going on in iraq but it s hard to get the news from everywhere else
7366553 it is unreasonable to expect significant improvement in the fvap as long as the key players
7366554 voting isn t always number one on the priority list but at the same time they are required to have time and materials to carry that duty out
7366555 part of our program is making sure that each vao has a continuity book so they can turn that over to whoever replaces them
7366556 i think we do well by getting out what we have there s always room to improve things internet voting would be one
7366557 i think this election especially is going to be a big turnout because servicemembers want to get their two cents in with what s going on
7366558 a soldier who is busy with convoys on a daily basis doesn t want to have to think about where he she is registered then wait five to six weeks to get the absentee ballot back
7366559 in this age people want instant gratification so having soldiers registered beforehand can help facilitate that
7366560 we don t know if our efforts are fruitless or if we re getting the job done
7366561 as an american in uniform we need to take it that much more seriously
7366562 we re physically protecting that i see it as more of a duty than a right
7366563 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run from the scene
7366564 to my darling will miss your smile so much rip babe love you always
7366565 i will never forget you you will always be there in my memories in my heart
7366566 we had to leave all our clothes there we were running for our lives
7366567 for some it is very difficult they witnessed atrocities there
7366568 it s a flexible number it changes by the minute
7366569 but we re scared of the russians they can do anything
7366570 all of us want to go but the houses are burned destroyed
7366571 we saw the russian troops coming in and that was when we left
7366572 we re not afraid of the south ossetians we re afraid of the russians i think this will last for quite a long time
7366573 do you really think nuns are all elderly straitlaced and funereal
7366574 its no longer that way these days there are nuns from africa and latin america who are really very very lovely the brazilians particularly
7366575 our roads are getting busier each year and the more we can do to provide alternatives and give the public a choice the more it improves the experience of visiting stirling
7366576 its not just about tackling congestion this new bus route provides an opportunity for people who dont have their own transport to access destinations along the route
7366577 its the spectre of a food fuel and water crisis
7366578 since water consumption goes up where there is development and improved lifestyles we can expect even greater demands on fresh water
7366579 there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate that water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries
7366580 by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis
7366581 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatisation of the resource
7366582 when peoples access to clean drinking water is reliant on the profit interests of a handful of transnationals all of us pay a premium and because of this many of the worlds poor go thirsty
7366583 if the bank is truly interested in alleviating poverty its conditions should take a longer view

7366629 we have fought the fire from both land and air this morning and more than 20 fire trucks contributed to this struggle by using the paths created by bulldozers fortunately the fire has been controlled after these intense efforts
7366630 the situation is still risky due to the rough terrain so the fire may still spread we are trying to bring the fire under complete control before dark
7366631 it will be very useful to discuss the measures that should be taken in regard to sports achievements through a commission that will be set up to investigate the reasons for our poor performance we have been working on the matter for a long time we may file a request for an investigation when parliament resumes this issue should be reviewed thoroughly
7366632 what is important here is the national sports policy sporting is not just a matter of political discussion it is important to everyone parliament should make a wholesale contribution to this everything that needs to be done should be done if necessary commissions should be set up for hearings testimony and investigation a good strategy should be adopted to prevent future disappointments this is a very important issue and not just political parties but all relevant actors can contribute
7366633 of course sports serve to remove all political differences our political parties should consider this and offer solutions for a common goal
7366634 in general there is no interest in sports other than soccer everybody is interested in soccer most of our time and resources are allocated to that particular sport in this way our soccer has made some progress but we have fallen behind in weightlifting and swimming individual sports should receive more attention and more resources should be reserved for these sports
7366635 the children should be trained at earlier ages olympic accomplishments may be secured only through the proper programs success or failure in international contests is a national matter this is why we are excited by success and saddened by failure surely parliament can make a contribution to the development of a better sporting policy
7366636 in fact sports are fundamental subjects of conversation in our daily lives but soccer attracts the greatest attention it became commercialized however turkey has the potential to train the best players and athletes sports should be promoted to train confident healthy athletes for a healthier generation and a better social life we have opportunities to make moves beyond simply distributing fliers to promote turkey
7366637 it is really sad that a country like turkey fails in sports and has to recruit foreign players for success
7366638 we have been pondering this there is a suitable environment and climate for training great athletes we have to start a mobilization that will involve young players and talented kids it is so easy to focus on this
7366639 to me what is wrong is the situation of the athletes transferred from other countries there are many in an olympic team of 68 these people compete on behalf of turkey the news reports on them are pretty interesting they say for instance two turkish girls will run on behalf of turkey even if you say this they are not turkish girls
7366640 instead of bringing in foreign athletes maybe importing foreign trainers is a better option let us train our athletes by importing the best trainers from ethiopia or china it seems to me that it is better to import the style that made these foreign players successful than to import the athletes turkey is a strong country and it is capable of training athletes who will win titles in the olympic games to do this plans should be developed and implemented we have examples in places like china and we can do it too
7366641 these missile systems are intended to be used for testing and training purposes to simulate threats that may come from countries with ex soviet systems in their inventories
7366642 the missile systems were not purchased to be launched against perceived enemies and they will not be included in the inventory of the turkish armed forces tsk they will be tested at the konya range with ehts systems their radars and fire control systems are to be bought separately
7366643 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7366644 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7366645 we are involved in the design phase of this power station
7366646 gradually the complementary design phase and its building will begin
7366647 the site has been chosen and the preparation process is under way
7366648 we are negotiating in order to determine the time of his trip to iran
7366649 if theyre taking steps unilaterally then what we can do it looks like the peoples party wants to break ties with us
7366650 biden who is 65 was clearly chosen over lesser known democrats to plug holes in obamas relatively thin resume on the national political scene and to blunt mccains relentless attacks on his lack of experience at a time when the united states is fighting two wars while polls show voters are most concerned about the countrys wobbly economy home mortgage foreclosures high fuel costs and growing unemployment mccains appeal appears to be growing out of the lingering shock to americans sense of security from the sept 11 2001 terror attacks mccain called biden a wise selection but mccain indicated that he believed there was still plenty to criticize
7366651 if you do not solve the cyprus problem then i will not approve the financial aid package of 5 billion which you expect from us from the congress
7366652 there will be no going back to the period before 1974 as far as safety and security are concerned
7366653 mr dink underwent prosecution under article 301 of the turkish criminal code as he spoke about the armenian genocide
7366654 legal measures were taken about mr dink as he regarded the events that happened in 1915 as genocide
7366655 biden has so far been involved in all kinds of movements which are against turkey
7366656 i must say that im surprised with obamas selection of biden it is not easy to be happy with this selection when looking from turkey and considering bidens almost two decade long firm support of the armenian disaporas efforts for recognition of their allegations of a genocide
7366657 the only thing we can do now as citizens of turkey is to wish obama and biden luck although this combination is not very hope inspiring from turkeys perspective however the most important duty for nongovernmental organizations and the media as well as politicians is to thoroughly inform the obama camp about turkeys policies and understanding on certain issues we should engage both the mccain and obama camps before one of them is elected not after the election is over
7366658 we are removing immunities in our party program also but we believe that removing immunities on politicians only is not a true step for us we will take the immunities issue as a whole we have made serious preparations for this
7366659 our voice is heard when we scream we cannot remain silent about a place to which we are so close thats why we will try our best
7366660 now the main opposition has started talking again not because it knows so much the ships passing through the straits the necessary things required by the montreux convention are being done
7366661 i will not focus on the exact figures warships totaling a maximum of 45 000 tons can pass through and this is for non black sea littoral countries there is no such limitation for black sea littoral countries thats to say we have the right to have as many ships there as we want to so does russia but non littorals do not have such a right a country cannot send a ship sized more than 30 000 tons to the black sea but it can send ships of 45 000 tons in total
7366662 you know that they the us wanted to sail a 69 000 ton hospital ship and we gave the order to our foreign ministry saying its passage was possible by no means because the montreux convention doesnt allow this and they the us took this as reasonable and didnt insist we want everyone to be loyal to agreements whatever those agreements may be
7366663 in this context four ships belonging to the standing nato maritime group 1 spain sps almirante don juan de borbon germany fgs luebeck poland orp general kazimierz pulaski and us uss taylor will visit the ports of constanza in romania and varna in bulgaria in the west black sea and our countrys stanbul ports for training and as part of natos planned activities approved in october 2007 excluding this passages of other foreign military ships including those of the us are being done in line with the montreux convention
7366664 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7366665 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economy of neighboring countries
7366666 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the cease fire agreement
7366667 this is our best chance at winning the white house in a long time
7366668 i am so fired up and so are all the delegates ive talked to
7366669 maybe then ill hear what it is that moves all these obama people
7366670 the democratic party is about as united as ive ever seen it
7366671 maybe theres some clinton supporters out there who havent seen the light yet but they need to get over it the view that john mccain is this cuddly old grandpa is just a bunch of you know what hes anti choice anti health care and more pro iraq war than george bush and dick cheney
7366672 i cannot put into words what it feels like knowing that ill be witnessing something this historic
7366673 when youre a kid in school you learn about martin luther king and the i have a dream speech
7366674 and now 45 years to the day of that speech well be seeing an african american accepting the democratic nomination for president
7366675 im not a conspiracy theorist obamas going to win the nomination
7366676 even though id still like hillary to be the nominee and get elected president im excited about the democrats chances this year i think were going to win
7366677 the iraq war weighed heavily with me and he was against it from the start plus i like what hes saying about the economy and the environment
7366678 ive taken him with me to so many meetings and rallies this past year that he must think that mommy just has a ton of friends
7366679 hes already a veteran campaigner at 3 and a half
7366680 if you cross the median chances are good that the resulting crash will cause a fatality or incapacitating injury because they usually occur at high speeds
7366681 the studies make it clear that cable barriers are keeping people from crossing the median and they are saving lives
7366682 if we all vote for her she has a chance
7366683 weve got a lot of action going there are going to be some surprises if we get a vote anything can happen
7366684 we want the chance to speak and the police wont let us have an inch
7366685 i really feel like fort worth is on the map because we have an apple store
7366686 we feel apple will bring in a customer who may not have visited us before
7366687 his intellect is not an issue its his attention span and maturity level because he has a late birthday he is probably going to be the youngest in his class
7366688 its been a hard decision everyone has a different opinion
7366689 we see more the opposite students who are 5 and their parents wanting them to go to first grade convinced that their students are academically and mature enough
7366690 we would like for the student to know at least 10 letters of the alphabet be able to count to 10 know and be able to say their birthday and know their colors
7366691 if you have a boy who likes to play around a lot but is smart he could get in trouble if hes held back and gets bored
7366692 we will look at it again at the end of the year and if we think he needs it let him repeat kindergarten
7366693 if he repeats pre k this year hes definitely going to be bored
7366694 and if you have too many pounds on the market the way to move them is to lower the price
7366695 we just announced 900 million in increased costs and have lost 193 million the first nine months of fiscal 2008
7366696 weve laid off about 2 300 people 1 100 at six distribution centers in north carolina 600 in el dorado ark 600 in bossier city and clinton la and another 25 to 30 at a distribution center in el paso
7366697 thousands of american workers already have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis facing the meat protein industry
7366698 but if grains stay high theyll start seeing how expensive meat will be in a few years its already started
7366699 the average u s retail price of beef now 4 per pound will rise to at least 5
7366700 pork will rise from 2 80 per pound to at least 3 50 higher prices for competing meats will of course be beneficial to the poultry industry
7366701 theres not a deluge of it but it does happen
7366702 software programming or something else could be incorrect we do get questions about concerns from citizens
7366703 they charged me the sales tax on the full amount and then deducted the 10
7366704 so i ended up paying sales tax on that 10 discount
7366705 if in fact there was an error on our part we certainly want to communicate with her and make sure if its a couple of dollars that she is entitled to that we take care of that
7366706 when coupons or certificates are accepted by retailers as part of the selling price of any taxable item the value of the coupon or certificate is excluded from the tax as a cash discount regardless of whether the retailer is reimbursed for the amount represented by the coupons or certificate
7366707 im not going to give up on this i am pretty determined ill be the voice ill keep stomping up and down and get my refund but what about other people
7366708 the disadvantage of that is that we have nothing to go off of
7366709 but the advantage is that we really get to set the direction for agriculture in ghazni province
7366710 the commanders on the ground want as many of these teams as they can get
7366711 they see the good in what the teams can do long term to turn the tide and create stability in the farming regions
7366712 there has been some but not enough to meet the needs of afghanistan revitalizing agriculture is one of the key priorities for our government to the extent that we get technical assistance in military form or civilian form it helps us a great deal
7366713 ive been an infantry officer my entire career 25 years
7366714 this is very different i always thought my command would be in a combat mission but this is a good mission you really get to see the effects youre having
7366715 the challenges weve had getting states on board is because the guard is so busy with missions throughout the theater
7366716 we compete with resources with the entire national guard but having said that the local farm boys of the army guard have come out of the woodwork
7366717 it looks like barren wasteland until you drop water on it
7366718 i dont know what kind of magic stuff is in the soil
7366719 we have not seen any in ghazni but if we did we would not do anything about it thats another units job
7366720 whatever they can sell their harvest for at that time is what they get the rest of it goes to waste they have no means to store it or preserve it
7366721 whatever they can capture and collect at their spot is what they have available water management is the largest issue and it cannot be resolved in one year it will be handed off to future teams
7366722 just in the small amount of time our boys have been on the ground theyve gone after some quick hit infrastructure support projects to start making a turn for the local farmers
7366723 a lot of times these kids dont know or understand the connection between the two but i was brought up in the church where the pastor came to the school to tell me i was going to be somebody
7366724 and when you reach a certain plateau in life you reach back and help somebody else
7366725 i try to tell a lot of the parents you dont want to be in my shoes losing a child is a pain that is unbelievable a lot of the parents now are fighting to make sure our kids go to school and be safe in school
7366726 the relationship between the body and its visual and verbal representation
7366727 dejando de lado por un momento las mezquindades a las que nos tienen acostumbrados
7366728 el deprimente espect culo de antivalores y de la falta de superaci n y compromiso
7366729 sus l deres disfrutan de m s privilegios y fueros que todos los dem s mexicanos adem s de ser intocables y manipuladores
7366730 ning n maestro puede seguir si ndolo mientras prefiera convertirse en provocador de disturbios sociales sin que nadie entienda las razones olvidando su principal tarea de ser ejemplo para la ni ez y la juventud
7366731 indignante pobreza de muchos frente a la insultante riqueza de algunos
7366732 por eso nos opondremos al cierre y si es necesario llevaremos a cabo un paro nacional para defender estos centros educativos
7366733 se puso a la oferta y demanda estos espacios entre profesionistas y normalistas donde los primeros carecen de preparaci n pedag gica
7366734 i know everyone is sad and i know mr weil was 107 but i really wanted to meet him barack ive met but mr weil now he really changed the look of the nation
7366735 its something we all knew would happen but we still werent prepared for it when it happened
7366736 we used enamel snaps until i convinced the sobs at scoville to make pearl snaps
7366737 the family would have starved if we only sold to cowboys
7366738 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
7366739 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
7366740 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7366741 i trust so few that it is much easier to simply keep no secrets
7366742 it is a huge massive honour to carry the flag
7366743 especially given the outstanding performances of the team at these games it is a fantastic end to an amazing few weeks
7366744 the closing ceremony is a party basically and whether youve succeeded or not in terms of your personal goals the tension has gone and its a sense of relief its over and its a fantastic atmosphere
7366745 to be there and be leading out the team with the flag with billions of people watching and to be picked out as an individual from a team of amazing athletes makes it even more special because this time you could have picked one of a dozen people who would have justifiably had a right to carry that flag
7366746 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7366747 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7366748 we have a deadline to file a report and for recommendations with the governor and the legislature by may 31 on the qualifying certificate program in addition to the exemption program so were going to have a fairly comprehensive meeting coming up
7366749 we did make immediate assessments and also recommendations in ways to comply with the requirements of our regulatory agencies
7366750 this is the second time we had a conference focused on veterans
7366751 do you know western developers can you find us a couple of western developers to choose from
7366752 ok how do you feel about being the creative director on
7366753 i started immediately to think about what i would change in the game

7366758 i thought maybe kicking some ass would get the word out that chicks better think twice before messing with my husband
7366759 well i guess thats one way of handling the situation i probably would have ordered room service and watched pay per view but thats just me
7366760 he was doing his job he stepped up to the hole and was blocked by an offensive lineman
7366761 we will be fine but it will be a struggle the next few days
7366762 they just lost their youngest son so theyre not doing well
7366763 theyre doing about as well as can be expected theyre an amazing strong family they were concerned about how the teammates would feel concerned about how the players on the other team are thats the type of people were dealing with here
7366764 i have so many memories of him his expressions the things he did in assembly for fun
7366765 we forget to embrace each day and appreciate everybody around us because we really dont know how may days were given
7366766 matt will always be alive to me i have so many memories of him
7366767 our roads are getting busier each year and the more we can do to provide alternatives and give the public a choice the more it improves the experience of visiting stirling

7366782 i heard a voice ordering them to turn the car in a different direction
7366783 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7366784 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7366785 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7366786 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7366787 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented

7366859 mr biden who sought the democratic presidential nomination himself this year before pulling out after performing poorly in the first contest in iowa has shown himself to be a tough political brawler a characteristic that many democrats say mr obama has not displayed against mr mccain that is something that presidential candidates typically look for in a running mate
7366860 i think he obama can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7366861 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off

7366909 many things were involved not the least of it a lot of really hard work and our commitment to a philosophy of survival first meaning we aimed at cutting expenses and working towards a long shot plan that ended up coming through for us
7366910 it took us 18 months to get through our reorganization plan the hard part looking back was ensuring that everybody agreed to and did all the things they needed to do in the end it was quite remarkable to see so many people working to save this hospital
7366911 by fall we want to look like a new hospital

7366941 fomos bem com tr s zagueiros soubemos segurar bem quando a portuguesa veio para cima da gente no segundo tempo
7366942 ele pediu para n o nos acomodarmos porque 4 a 0 um resultado que pode tranq ilizar
7366943 um golpe grande do qual vamos nos recuperar em seguida come a o campeonato espanhol ganhamos for as necess rio tirar conclus es positivas e ser otimistas vamos nos fortalecer por dentro temos que nos levantar e aprender uma ferida que vai cicatrizar

7366958 i cant understand how people are made to work on shabbat in a jewish country
7366959 tzuberi was not fired for not working on shabbat and holidays but because of our dissatisfaction with her work and this was clearly explained to her in the conversation we had about her dismissal
7366960 throughout her employment in the club the management received complaints regarding her service and her attitude the management conducted a few meetings in which shimrit was warned and it was clarified to her that her behavior is unacceptable and warning letters were also sent to her on this issue
7366961 shimrit did indeed receive a warning about her work if the problems continued afterwards why did tzuberi remain in her position for another year and a half in which she also instructed new girls on the position
7366962 instead of finding unjustified claims regarding the reasons for her dismissal it is worthwhile for the company to come and thoroughly examine the reasons tzuberi was fired
7366963 the struggle for the freedom of religion in israel has to include defending a persons right to refrain from working on the day of rest and to note the sabbath in accordance with their world view and faith the fact that shimrit turned to an organization that works within a framework of reform judaism proves that the struggle for religious freedom serves all sectors of israeli society seculars and religious alike
7366964 the reasons for shimrits dismissal were practical even though she is pretending that they are religiously connected shimrit received everything she was entitled to receive upon her dismissal and is trying to unacceptably receive additional money from the company
7366965 in general it is important to emphasize that the holmes place franchise employs religious people and claims have never been made about the company treating these workers unacceptably or rudely or dismissing them over their religiousness
7366966 i pledge allegiance to the earth and all the life which it supports our planet in our care irreplaceable with sustenance and respect for all

7366971 the legislature is firmly committed to crafting a long term solution to our states transportation challenges while the steps we are taking with this agreement and our current discussions with txdot will allow us to meet the priority new construction needs over the next three years
7366972 we should look to the local entities to make sure the money goes where people want it to go
7366973 infrastructure investment particularly in transportation has the potential to provide strong steady returns and pension plan administrators should embrace this new asset class

7366977 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority
7366978 the moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them the state is denying the equality of all before the law
7366979 if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual
7366980 one must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it but are directed toward its healing the improvement of its condition of health or its individual survival
7366981 it is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as disposable biological material
7366982 certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities
7366983 we really want to be back at home in our own environment christian wants to be back amongst friends getting some normality back into his life

7367009 in firefox 2 we put up a message that was incomprehensible to users about trust chains and so forth we also gave users a whatever button which essentially allows the user to ignore the security warning
7367010 but the warning is valid and users should adhere it we decided to default block self signed and untrusted certificates users can add exceptions and make them permanent if they want to

7367094 this notion that well have water forever is wrong the world is running out of fresh water
7367095 water is a common resource water is not a property
7367096 and its going to lead you to selling to those who can buy it and not to those who need it
7367097 who owns the water for survival owns you and thats the picture that people have to understand

7367105 telos has managed to do something that few others have accomplished both an openness to truth and a willingness to take a hard look at what is thought about it
7367106 telos maintains a truly global perspective and a universal range of sympathies it is one of the very few remaining morally uncensored forums for open political discussion one suspects that in these dark times its best days are yet to come
7367107 telos remains provocative and independent in a time of intellectual banality
7367108 telos is an intellectually provocative quarterly that dares to present unpopular views and truths

7367112 yo creo que se vio un equipo sin coraz n sin ambici n sin hambre y cuando perdemos eso perdemos la esencia fundamental de lo que es esta instituci n pero ojo que esa situaci n no solamente la podemos manejar hacia los jugadores los responsables somos nosotros yo como director deportivo soy el primer responsable de todo lo que est pasando y ya no se vale m s mirar hacia atr s y llorar todo lo que pas se vale mirar hacia adelante es jornada doble y hay que revertir esto pero con esp ritu y coraz n que han hecho que esta instituci n sea ganadora e importante dentro de nuestro futbol
7367113 no pasa por el t cnico la situaci n c mo puede ser que este cuerpo t cnico y este grupo de jugadores que nos dieron tanto yo creo que lo que est pasando es que estamos jugando sin coraz n sin la esencia de lo que es esta instituci n
7367114 lo nico que hay que hacer ac es como siempre hemos hecho unidos en las buenas y en las malas apoyar a este grupo de jugadores a este cuerpo t cnico y salir y darnos cuenta todos que lo que estamos haciendo no alcanza hay que hacer m s de lo que estamos haciendo para que pachuca vuelva a los primeros planos
7367115 es un equipo que hoy toca fondo yo creo que peor de lo que se jug hoy no se puede llegar a jugar y no hablo del aspecto futbol stico porque se puede ganar empatar o perder errar goles yo pienso que pachuca perdi la esencia de lo que ha hecho a esta instituci n ganadora de lo que ha hecho a esta instituci n obtener logros importantes a nivel nacional e internacional que es la ambici n y el coraz n para lograr cosas
7367116 es importante que el equipo gane y estoy contento por haber colaborado con un gol afortunadamente se me da la oportunidad y lo hice lo mejor posible afortunadamente se me dieron las cosas
7367117 fue un partido complicado pero afortunadamente pudimos concretar las jugadas que tuvimos pero pudimos haber metido m s goles nos hizo falta un poco de manejo de partido pero hay que seguir trabajando y tener m s tranquilidad a la hora de definir porque tuvimos ocasiones para aumentar el marcador y no lo hicimos
7367118 ahora a pensar en el equipo de jamaica empezar a trabajar ma ana para ver qui nes son los que viajar n
7367119 hoy se me da el marcar el gol y ahora de aqu para adelante
7367120 hab a que seguir busc ndolo y afortunadamente hoy se me da el marcar el gol y ahora de aqu para adelante
7367121 no celebr por respeto por todo lo que medio pachuca pero ahora lo intent buscar contra ellos lo tuve y ahora hacia adelante
7367122 te da confianza te da ese extra que te falta como delantero te lo da un gol y esperemos seguir as
7367123 con el aficionado con el due o del equipo con la directiva estamos con deuda total porque no es nada placentero estar dando estos resultados como el que tuvimos hoy
7367124 hemos estado en unos partidos adelante y nos han superado pero hoy fue un partido pr cticamente controlado y nos meten el gol y a ra z de eso dejamos de hacer nos descomponemos dejamos de participar colectivamente y nos volvemos un equipo vulnerable
7367125 no solamente las derrotas y los empates han tra do consigo que s lo tengamos 2 puntos tambi n el funcionamiento colectivo que no es bueno perdemos la pelota con much sima facilidad y eso trae consecuencias que las podemos ver en el manejo del equipo
7367126 creo que era un partido muy parejo ya en los ltimos minutos tuvimos muchas desatenciones que nos costaron muchos goles hemos tenido errores y en lo personal tambi n y as lo asumo y no queda m s que aplicarnos en eso hemos tenido varios errores no s si son desatenciones o falta de concentraci n pero creo hace falta concentraci n en la parte de atr s
7367127 la verdad que es pesado recibir cinco goles en casa pero ahora hay que cambiar el chip y analizar lo que se hizo bien y mal para pensar en la copa sudamericana me doli aparte era un partido especial para m al enfrentar a santos mi ex equipo se cometieron errores y no queda m s que mejorar y poner m s atenci n en la parte de atr s
7367128 hay que darle la vuelta a la p gina y pensar en el aragua por ah hay que analizar lo que se hizo bien y mal ante santos pero ahora la realidad es aragua y hay que traernos un resultado positivo
7367129 estamos haciendo un buen torneo los jugadores que salieron los extra amos pero los que nos quedamos estamos haciendo igual o mejor las cosas y tenemos que seguir por el mismo camino
7367130 tuve la oportunidad de contribuir con el equipo es lo que siempre busco ayudar al equipo qu bueno que mis compa eros pudieron aprovechar
7367131 es algo bueno que nos den oportunidad y la confianza

7367137 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes
7367138 kathy we are in sacramento for almost an hour would you like to get off and stretch your legs
7367139 no thanks but maybe buddy would like to stretch his legs
7367140 im not xander lady and i dont think i know him either
7367141 listen i dont know whats going on here but those kids killed three humans and nothing does that where i come from without being shot or getting shot at
7367142 no theyve been turned into demons by something its not theyre fault
7367143 so what do we do sit back while people die
7367144 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7367145 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your advertisement house
7367146 their projected rates of expansion are so fast we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7367147 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7367148 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oilsands the oilsands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply

7367150 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills

7367152 in my opinion old men who want to marry girls at the age of their granddaughters are mentally sick and need psychological treatment
7367153 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
7367154 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
7367155 as most of the cases take place in remote villages where there is poverty and illiteracy we need to launch a campaign to make people aware of the social and moral implications of such marriages
7367156 the mother should not hesitate to inform the police if the father insists on marrying his child to an old man
7367157 fathers like these consider their daughters to be slaves selling them to the highest bidder
7367158 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
7367159 we have gathered today to get back our land money cannot compensate our loss

7367162 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbour is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7367163 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7367164 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7367165 it took off and reported a technical problem and tried to return to the airport

7367170 were going to teach our kids how to speak important languages
7367171 to advance americas interests around the world and defeat this notion about our you know our bullying concept of freedom by letting people see what were about
7367172 people understand in a competitive world youve got to be fluent in the languages where business is booming and china is one of those places
7367173 we do have pretty compelling data that show there are really good reasons to put in good programs at the elementary level
7367174 i like counting and i like doing activities on the smart board
7367175 it lets them feel chinese is not like a boring language
7367176 maybe you can learn about china because its very far away
7367177 look at the us in iraq everybody was opposed even their allies but they did not listen and what happened they do not know how to get out of it now now we understand that we are all linked to the us and if it falls apart it would be a real collapse we have to help them to get out of there that means that cooperation is needed a new world order is necessary and global mechanisms to manage it
7367178 this league of democracies would not supplant the united nations or other international organizations it would complement them but it would be the one organization where the worlds democracies could come together to discuss problems and solutions on the basis of shared principles and a common vision of the future if i am elected president i will call a summit of the worlds democracies in my first year to seek the views of my democratic counterparts and begin exploring the practical steps necessary to realize this vision
7367179 yes there have been differences between america and europe no doubt there will be differences in the future but the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together a change of leadership in washington will not lift this burden in this new century americans and europeans alike will be required to do more not less partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
7367180 in this new world such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them that is why we cannot afford to be divided no one nation no matter how large or powerful can defeat such challenges alone

7367208 the liberals control the ultimate passage of so much of this through the senate so the question of economic responsibility goes fair and squarely back to them mr rudd told abc radio today
7367209 are they going to puncture a 3 7 or 6 1 billion immediate black hole into the budget at a time of global economic uncertainty
7367210 my appeal is that you are either going to be part of the responsible economic future of this country or simply play short term politics
7367211 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
7367212 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

7367217 in the midst of the twisted forests we had found unlikely sanctuary in a small crumbling estate guarded by automated turrets we hoped that the gamekeeper who lived there might be able to give us some understanding of the surrounding madness
7367218 to think that i was worried those turrets would put me out of a job and instead they saved my life its funny how things work out isnt it
7367219 the old coot seems to have found his voice unfortunately remember dont eat or drink anything he offers you it will all come from the forest
7367220 perhaps i should stay outside and see what i can learn about these turrets
7367221 good idea and keep an eye on the tree line for any of those forest creatures

7367267 in a way the postponement is a victory for us we are confident that the situation will get better we are sure that the tournament will be held in pakistan next year

7367278 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7367279 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7367280 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7367281 a government by the people a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system

7367283 whether its the liberal party or whether its independents in the senate or the greens the gvernment will fight for the integrity of our budget

7367568 its disappointing to have to postpone the tournament but in the end it was a rigorous process that was followed and in the end the security advice around pakistan has just been too tough to overcome

7367578 the united states is now winning the war that two years ago had seemed lost people are expressing a new confidence in their security forces parks are filled every weekend with families playing
7367579 we are going to pick up seats as a result of this war
7367580 nobel prize for creative statistics or the pulitzer for fiction
7367581 there was only so much that you could take until we in fact had to leave the room for a while
7367582 it has embraced the ballot box it has created a fair and popular constitution it has avoided civil war iraqs violence has largely become local and criminal the violence while tragic has ceased being political and is therefore no longer nearly as important as it was
7367583 a persons past vote tells you something about his or her judgment obama talked a lot about the clarity of his judgment in opposing the iraq war
7367584 when he voted against the surge in january 2007 he claimed on more than one occasion that it would lead to increased casualties and sectarian violence it didnt howd he get that one wrong
7367585 in january 2007 obama claimed that the iraqi government would make no hard choices if the united states stayed
7367586 if obama was wrong about the tactical gains that would be made by the new strategy and wrong about how the iraqi political leaders will react can his larger theory about how iraqis will respond to a troop pullout remain intact
7367587 the violence in anbar has gone down despite the surge not because of the surge
7367588 the reality is that neither barack obama nor nuri al maliki nor most anybody else believes that the iraq war can be lost at this point
7367589 they were a hundred of them loading up their trucks with anything they could carry they came four or five times
7367590 the next day they had ships blocking the harbour and then russians came several times on to the base to blow up our vessels
7367591 should we sit behind the fence what use would we be then they will drive around in hummers move munitions around in trucks and are we supposed to just count them
7367592 lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have shown the work
7367593 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7367594 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good

7367600 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7367601 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run from the scene

7367604 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7367605 dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead i had to keep giving her the sad news over and over again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7367606 it was pretty obvious when i last saw her in november 2005 that she was pretty off the map so to speak but like with reagan people give former heads of state some dignity because of the stigma attached
7367607 we know she has had small strokes and these lead to memory loss you can still have a conversation with her about contemporary politics dementia is a very emotive word which conjures up a very particular image in conversation thatcher may need a bit of occasional reminding but then so do we all
7367608 the main worry the mpc should have about the fall in sterling is whether it will have a significant positive impact on growth
7367609 there is worrying evidence that uk manufacturers are preferring to use the lower pound as cover to raise their prices and profit margins rather than to expand market share and production volumes
7367610 one of the most striking features of the last year is the way in which wage inflation has remained subdued despite the rise in headline inflation and despite the fall in the exchange rate
7367611 and with the labour market outlook worsening markedly there is no reason to expect the latest fall in sterling to generate any second round inflationary consequences that would concern the mpc
7367612 with the number of final salary schemes plunging to a record low they have now become gold dust for those employees who still have them employers can turn this to their advantage because the schemes give them a competitive edge in the fight to attract and retain talent
7367613 while regulation improved life expectancy and market volatility have all served to increase pressures on employers sponsoring db pension schemes good scheme design can play a vital role in mitigating their effects
7367614 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production
7367615 instead they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil dependent countries

7367635 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7367636 currently the recommendations in the uk are that aspirin is prescribed after a full risk assessment under medical supervision to those who have established cardiovascular disease
7367637 further robust research is needed before aspirin should be considered as a blanket primary prevention measure in the uk
7367638 has got nothing to do with the situation i was in
7367639 its got nothing to do with him if we lost two games
7367640 if a player didnt want to play for me i know what id do
7367641 id drive him myself to wherever he wants to go just to get rid of him i had a player two years ago when i got my job who i heard had been speaking to another club and i just sold him and said off you go and he went ok and off he popped i wouldnt try too hard to talk a player out of moving
7367642 those teams dont get about us like english teams do
7367643 teams like roma will let you play but against teams who show grit and determination roll their sleeves up and battle against you its a different kettle of fish we got a bit excited when we started beating teams 5 0 and 3 0 and weve come back to reality with a bump
7367644 i have a big point to prove after the way i finished at liverpool
7367645 i think i can do really well in the premier league it suits the way i play im made for england
7367646 well have to put a good performance on when we go to chelsea

7367651 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7367652 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7367653 and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7367654 general opinion in the party is in favor of parting ways
7367655 i see the parties on two different paths because the promises and the agreements are not being fulfilled
7367656 this is an effort on our part to tie the three events together the world trade center the pentagon and shanksville
7367657 i couldnt have dreamed this would turn out any better all the brotherhood coming down from new york and new jersey and showing up here today to pay their respect to this piece of steel
7367658 i was very happy that everyone was able to get together
7367659 id never seen it on tape or heard any of the commentary for me that against chela was the best game that ive ever played for sure ill show some friends and stuff if i want to show off a little bit
7367660 i just think for me this is my best surface
7367661 ive said it all along i think i play my best tennis here i feel most comfortable on the courts and my results have shown that ive always played well in america so yeah i think this is my best chance for winning a slam
7367662 i love new york as a city when i missed wimbledon last year i realised how much it meant to me so i always want to play great at wimbledon and do well there but just for my personality and stuff i think the us open and new york suits me better
7367663 theres definitely tougher draws out there but youve got to make sure that youre switched on from the start of the slams
7367664 its not so much that youre worried about losing the match but you dont want to have any dips early at the start of the match you want to come through as quickly as possible and not have too many long matches at the start of the tournament
7367665 i dont think you really know whether you are ready or not i just think you do all the things that are going to give you the best shot at doing it and when the opportunity comes you either take it or you dont
7367666 id like to think that i can take it when the opportunity comes but you know ive never been past the quarters before so whether im ready or not i dont know
7367667 sometimes in a big tournament you need a bit of luck i dont think im ready to just breeze through a slam like a federer or a nadal and there will be tough matches along the way but sometimes the seeds go out early and there are some upsets and you just have to make the most of it
7367668 the erosion has been going on for years but it is being accelerated by sea level rise so we have to act earlier than we would have had to
7367669 its about balancing the interests of the site and finding the most sensible solution
7367670 weve got to bear in mind the impacts of climate change such as increased storminess
7367671 we have seen distraught patients remortgaging their houses giving up pensions and selling their cars to buy drugs that are freely available to those using health services in countries of comparable wealth
7367672 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7367673 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7367674 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7367675 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions
7367676 two out of the five big pharmaceutical companies are allegedly looking into their pricing and if they are prepared to go back and look at the cost of their drugs to make them more cost effective then i welcome that
7367677 it was the best marathon performance ever given the stakes and the conditions with heat and bright sun
7367678 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear but after listening to the explanation i am convinced this is the right procedure the right way to go

7367683 i believe we need a realistic policy that looks towards the future when i was a young sailor the world ran on whale oil i know there are a lot of whales off our coast right now full of sweet sweet blubber i propose we drill offshore in our whale population to solve our energy crisis dont give me scientific or economic data i say drill now drill anywhere dont think about anything those whales our this countrys greatest resource and there they sit playing in the surf blowing their spouts theyre asking for it i tell you theyre all asking for it thats change i can believe in
7367684 i think things are going fine people lost their houses because they were irresponsible i take care of all my houses however many i may have i know ordinary middle class people making less than five million a year can have hard times so i have a plan divorce your first wife and marry a rich one thats change i can believe in
7367685 only ive been around long enough to have the wisdom to deal with a crisis the moment i heard georgia had been invaded i strongly condemned general sherman and my complaining totally fixed everything thats change i can believe in

7367709 purposely created in america in 1970 in response to a rapidly rising interest in european paganism witchcraft and magic
7367710 as a form of witchcraft that was gardnerian in all but a few oath bound details and which could serve as a middle ground between the non initiate religion of the pagan way and the rigorous rules of the strict gardnerians
7367711 wicca has been up until the past decade or so a closed religion but no more the inner components of wicca are available to anyone who can read and has the proper wit to understand the material wiccas only secrets are its individual ritual forms spells names of deities and so on
7367712 candles a statue a white robe incense and either sulfur sea salt or un iodized salt
7367713 in determining whether the church of wicca is a religion protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment the district court properly considered whether the church occupies a place in the lives of its members parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in god in religions more widely accepted in the united states
7367714 the district court also found that the contents of many of these doctrines parallel those of more conventional religions
7367715 the district court also noted that the churchs doctrines teach ceremonies parallel to those of recognized religions members of the church of wicca worship both individually and corporately members also follow spiritual leaders another objective criterion showing the church of
7367716 religious observances need not be uniform to merit the protection of the first amendment the supreme court has recognized that differing beliefs and practices are not uncommon among followers of a particular creed thomas v review board 450 u s at 715 it is not within the judicial function and judicial competence to inquire whether the petitioner or another practitioner more correctly perceived the commands of their common faith courts are not arbiters of scriptural interpretation 450 u s at 716 see also barrett v virginia 689 f 2d 498 501 n 5 4th cir 1982
7367717 not within the judicial function to inquire which person more correctly perceived the commands of their common faith
7367718 we affirm the district courts judgment that the doctrine proclaimed by the church of wicca is a religion entitling dettmer to the protection that the first amendment affords prisoners
7367719 courts are not to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith or the validity of particular litigants interpretations of those creeds
7367720 wicca is a polytheistic faith based on beliefs that prevailed in both the old world and the new world before christianity its practices include the use of herbal magic and benign witchcraft

7367745 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
7367746 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
7367747 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7367748 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7367749 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7367750 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7367751 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7367752 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7367753 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7367754 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7367755 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7367756 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7367757 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7367758 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7367759 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow
7367760 hes a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
7367761 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7367762 but i tell you what i dont want my grandson or my granddaughters going back in 15 years and so how we leave makes a big difference
7367763 theres no political point worth anybodys life out there none
7367764 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7367765 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7367766 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7367767 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7367768 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7367769 unless we fundamentally change the rotation dates and fundamentally change how many members of the national guard were calling up itll be virtually impossible to maintain 150 000 folks this year
7367770 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy

7367785 i constantly ring and i just keep getting fobbed off
7367786 i turn around and buy all my own food off them
7367787 the biggest thing that gets me is that they make money from me and pay someone else they could just do cash on delivery for me
7367788 its the difference in making a small business operate or not
7367789 its a very fine line between paying and not paying the bills
7367790 they are always about a month behind and we have seven day terms

7367810 american sigint had been surprised by the coup as had american intelligence in general
7367811 in the mad scramble for positioning that followed the viet cong in the nam bo saigon region directed subordinate elements to help soldiers officers and others politicians and security personnel involved in the coup to escape
7367812 were the communists on to something there is no doubt that they were correct in their assessment that the americans were disillusioned with diems failure to select a course of social reform and stick with it
7367813 the formation of the nlf probably marked the final eclipse for any viable independent noncommunist and nationalist alternative to diems rule as far back as the 1930s noncommunist nationalist organizations had essentially been destroyed by the french colonial security surete apparatus

7367826 the use of lists of words including individual names subjects locations et cetera has long been one of the methods used to sort out information of foreign intelligence value from that which is not of interest in the past such lists have been referred to occasionally as watch lists because the lists were used as an aid to watch for foreign activity of reportable intelligence interest however these lists generally did not contain names of u s citizens or organizations the activity in question is one in which u s names were used systematically as a basis for selecting messages including some between u s citizens when one of the communicants was at a foreign location

7367871 the provisional conclusions on the use of drugs for treating renal cancer are those of an independent appraisal committee whose membership is largely drawn from nhs clinicians in active practice they understand the issues at stake they themselves are often involved with the care of patients with cancer but they are also involved in the day to day care of patients with other conditions many as distressing
7367872 to maintain the credibility of their argument they need to explain which patients with other diseases should forgo cost effective care in order to meet the needs of those with renal cancer
7367873 there is a finite pot of money for the nhs if one group of patients is provided with cost ineffective care other groups lacking powerful lobbyists will be denied cost effective care for miserable conditions like schizophrenia crohns disease or cystic fibrosis
7367874 nice is doing it better than what we had 10 years ago which was clinicians making the decisions

7367900 i was trying to go down and away i didnt execute the pitch and big league hitters thats what theyre supposed to do

7367903 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7367904 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7367905 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything

7367929 they are going to take 10 palestinian students with them
7367930 the idea is to get them out of gaza to cyprus and then off to universities elsewhere
7367931 it was political the point was to break the siege and change israeli policy in gaza it wasnt a one time thing we are going to continue bringing boats into gaza and those will have humanitarian assistance on board
7367932 they let these two boats in so i dont see why they wouldnt let a third one in
7367933 were trying to open gaza up to the outside world in an additional gesture of solidarity with the residents of gaza some 25 of the humanitarian volunteers are scheduled to go out to sea with gaza fishermen on monday
7367934 there is no change in israeli policy and there is no need for the port since the palestinians are getting everything they need via the land based crossings

7367944 unfortunately hes very out of touch with reality with whats going on in tv
7367945 if you look at the last series of have i got news for you out of 20 contestants they had four women there is a failure to represent women in terms of news and political content

7367949 one tower went down perfectly the second only came down partially a third of it was left standing not exactly what we hoped for there were rumours they hit the motorway but when the dust cleared the highways agency said there was absolutely no debris on the nearby m1 motorway one of our teams chipped away at the concrete where it had become stuck and it finally came down at 5 30am
7367950 few people have been inside a cooling tower its such a vast amazing space
7367951 we really saw this as an opportunity for sheffield at times we really thought it might happen

7367953 it was the culmination of so much debate we did a survey into peoples attitudes and theres no question that everyone looked to them as a landmark some people love them and some hate them one woman said they were like marmite there were no camps on one side or the other yesterday everyone was just together

7367972 first all we had was the name of amanda nothing else
7367973 she was in the most dangerous place for journalists in the world and nothing happened to her
7367974 she said the only security i have is the shirt that i am wearing
7367975 she has to be on the frontlines and she has to be with the people to tell their story and the humanitarian side of everything was is huge for amanda to bring that to the light so that people can help

7367977 my brother in a low tone was trying not to answer my inquiries but made me understood that they were caught in a difficult situation i realized that things had changed and then their voices disappeared
7367978 wherever she is right now i know that shes keeping a positive attitude because shes an innately positive person
7367979 i dont want to use the word fearless but she is a courageous person of course theres apprehension and she did speak about that but she never really used the term fear
7367980 she said she was drawn to the passion of the people who were in these zones in other words if youre in a zone of conflict nothing is taken for granted and you live each moment like it was a lifetime of experience
7367981 she is an intelligent caring and adventurous professional who was well aware of the dangers of the regions she frequented

7368004 an alternative approach which has been called systemwide or macroprudential oversight would broaden the mandate of regulators and supervisors to encompass consideration of potential systemic risks and weaknesses as well
7368005 clearly conceptually it has to be the right answer to have a comprehensive regulatory structure and a comprehensive perspective
7368006 the only counterarguments are practical ones would the fed have enough staff would this broader approach imperil its political independence
7368007 theres a huge complementarity between the feds lender of last resort function and the intimate knowledge of financial institutions
7368008 the macroprudential supervisor would recognize that for the system as a whole excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment
7368009 in principle such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered and because activities or risk taking not permitted to regulated institutions have a way of migrating to other financial firms or markets

7368021 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7368022 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7368023 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7368024 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7368025 yes and anyway today is his last day so he has to leave

7368035 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7368036 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7368037 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7368038 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7368039 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7368040 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7368041 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7368042 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7368043 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7368044 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7368045 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7368046 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7368047 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7368048 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7368049 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7368050 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7368051 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7368052 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7368053 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7368054 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7368055 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7368056 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7368057 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7368058 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7368059 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7368060 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7368061 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7368062 it is unlikely that you will see a games of this size and scope and stature ever again
7368063 our priority is to leave a legacy for the community
7368064 our message has been clear and unambiguous to use the london games to drive the participation in olympic sports
7368065 one of the great strengths of china is the ability to mobilize so many resources and people
7368066 we will give the individuals bigger roles and more independence that is a model that works best for the british

7368071 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7368072 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7368073 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7368074 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7368075 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7368076 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7368077 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7368078 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7368079 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7368080 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7368081 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7368082 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7368083 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7368084 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7368085 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7368086 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7368087 weve seen these kinds of bailouts for the financial companies why not the automakers said aaron
7368088 la materia no se crea ni se destruye s lo se transforma
7368089 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7368090 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7368091 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7368092 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7368093 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7368094 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7368095 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7368096 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7368097 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7368098 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7368099 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7368100 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7368101 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7368102 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7368103 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7368104 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7368105 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7368106 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7368107 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7368108 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7368109 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7368110 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7368111 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7368112 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7368113 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7368114 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7368115 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7368116 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7368156 we might as well ask is it a parish in communion with the roman catholic church or a community in schism
7368157 the roman catholic church has a certain structure that needs to be respected
7368158 my authority as the archbishop in the archdiocese of brisbane is scarcely recognised by the parish of st marys
7368159 they either want to belong to the roman catholic church or they want to start their own church
7368160 in the area of liturgy they make up their own particular rules in the way they worship god
7368161 at the present they are not in communion with the roman catholic church
7368162 theairlineoilspin com will function as an information source and forum to discuss and learn about the airline industrys role in exacerbating their oil related dilemmas while at the same time benefiting from massive public subsidies
7368163 at the same time the industry has benefited from more than us 8 5 billion in taxpayer subsidies since 2001 according to a recent report shortchanged while passenger satisfaction levels and job quality standards for airline service workers have remained low
7368164 whether were talking about carrying their legislation or doling out more subsidies congress shouldnt be doing any more favours for an airline industry that appears to show such contempt for the american public
7368165 one who has seen the ocean thinks nothing of mere rivers the cloud of wushan is my only cloud
7368166 a binding legal contract exists between a traveller and an airline as soon as the airline issues an air ticket confirmed for a specific flight
7368167 as a consequence if you dont present yourself to fly the airline can keep the legal term is forfeit your fare if you want to change your ticket the airline can charge an amendment fee the airline couldnt keep the fare or charge an amendment fee unless a binding legal contract existed
7368168 because the ticket that is issued contains conditions of carriage the air travel is always subject to conditions of carriage all australian airlines list their conditions of carriage on their websites although some searching is needed because
7368169 the fascinating part of these conditions of carriage is that they completely negate the airlines contractual obligation with the passenger to carry the passenger on the ticketed flight its a case of the small print taking away the big print
7368170 the chief justice looked carefully at the conditions of carriage upon the air ticket he found that the conditions gave the airline a very wide discretion upon whether or not to carry the passenger at all and to abandon and reschedule any flight he concluded the exemption of the ticket in this case fully occupies the whole area of possible obligation leaving no room for the existence of a contract of carriage therefore in his opinion the issue of the ticket did not legally bind the airline to fly the passenger it was not until the passenger checked in at the airport received a boarding pass and perhaps not until the passenger was shown to his or her seat on the aeroplane that the airline was contractually bound to fly the passenger on the ticketed flight
7368171 on the outside balloon you have the obligation to fly and on the inside balloon the conditions of carriage imagine that there is no air trapped between the outside balloon and the inside balloon this is how an air ticket works the conditions of carriage are expansive and they leave no room for a passenger to enforce the obligation to fly the same as there being no air trapped between the inside balloon and the outside balloon
7368172 flying passengers is at the airlines discretion and legally airlines have very wide discretion
7368173 commercially the airline will fill all available seats but if they are overbooked they deny boarding
7368174 there is a chance a seat will not be available for you on your flight even if your reservation is confirmed this is due to the common practice in the airline industry of overbooking qantas policy on overbooking is available at qantas international airport ticket counters and boarding gates if an international flight from usa is overbooked no one will be denied a seat until qantas calls for volunteers to give up their reservations in exchange for a payment of qantas choosing if there are not enough volunteers qantas will deny boarding to reservation holders in accordance with its policy people involuntarily denied boarding may apply for compensation in accordance with that policy
7368175 the next reason that a passenger might be denied boarding is that the airline finds a reason to refuse to board the passenger
7368176 even if you have a ticket and a confirmed reservation we may refuse to carry you and your baggage if any of the following circumstances have occurred or we reasonably believe will occur
7368177 an airline has the right to refuse boarding and if it exercises that right what happens to the airfare its not lost if the airline is at fault such as it is with overbooking but it is lost if the passenger is at fault for a reason contained in the list for refusal to board
7368178 if you are travelling on private travel and not on business you have been prevented from travelling by events beyond your control an unusual and unforeseen circumstance and all or part of the fare for your ticket is non refundable we will give you a credit for the non refundable part of the fare for future travel on us provided that you have told us promptly about the events beyond your control and have given us satisfactory evidence of these events beyond your control the credit can be used for future travel on qantas flights ie a flight with a qf airline designator code if you were originally travelling on a qf flight we may deduct a reasonable service fee from the credit to cover our administration costs

7368196 facebook took the unfortunate decision to restrict most users from accessing scrabulous on august 22 in response to a take down notice from mattel on august 14
7368197 the high court had reserved judgement in this matter after hearing both parties it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the high courts decision
7368198 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be fair and neutral party took the step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent
7368199 we now await the decision of the high court and shall accordingly decide our future course of action regarding scrabulous

7368205 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7368206 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7368209 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7368210 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7368211 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7368212 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7368237 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7368238 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7368239 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7368240 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7368241 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7368242 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7368243 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7368244 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7368245 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7368246 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7368247 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7368248 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7368249 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7368250 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7368251 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7368253 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7368254 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7368255 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7368256 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7368257 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7368258 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7368259 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7368260 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7368261 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7368262 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7368263 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7368266 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7368267 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7368268 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7368269 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7368270 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7368271 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7368272 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7368273 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7368274 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7368275 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7368276 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7368277 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7368278 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7368279 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7368280 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7368281 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7368282 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7368283 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7368284 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7368285 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7368286 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7368287 the majority of those named on the list although they are living in the bliss and security of the diaspora and the anonymity of cyberspace their family members will not be so lucky
7368288 though perhaps as a friendly gesture they could warn mr mccain of the dangers of mr hikinds extreme ideas
7368289 i personally want the democratic party and its nominee senator barack obama to have a worthy opponent not a person who accepts support from such an unworthy source as dov hikind
7368290 i was involved with rabbi kahane and have no regrets
7368291 ive always made it very clear i got involved when the issues were anti semitism jewish poor things that were in america
7368292 either ignorant or trying to sear me with a label which is a clear mccarthy tactic
7368293 i dont know where the governors going but hes going big places
7368294 hes young hes going to be around playing a role and talking this straight talk
7368295 ive been elected 13 times by a 90 percent democrat community of 150 000 jews and non jews im running for reelection this year as a proud democrat but not a blind one for me its about supporting people whom i think are best i support republicans and many democrats
7368296 we see a lot of atv injuries weve been seeing them more as the economys been booming out here and were seeing them in all age groups not just young kids
7368297 people are going to start crying saying its a provincial regulation because its transportation related and we dont want the feds involved
7368298 yet youve got a patchwork framework across the country that is not only very confusing but is not based on any science whatsoever
7368299 its based on public opinion and its based on political lack of will to do anything about the issue
7368300 one of the things that we would like to see and were part of a national association is a little bit of standardization going on
7368301 the regulations are so fractured across this country its hard to keep track
7368302 we definitely need to pull this all together across the country
7368303 theres no long boat rides to get out to the reef which means more time exploring below the surface rather than getting there and back
7368304 what you see on a dive is different every day but just some of the highlights are the giant gropers eagle rays manta rays about four different varieties of turtles and loads of different species of sharks
7368305 as a kid i used to catch a ride with my friends out to lady musgrave to camp and dive and then wed just wait for another passing trawler to hitch a ride back home
7368306 this is one bread and butter issue that no one can ignore
7368307 its a growing concern and its clearly one of the largest concerns people have
7368308 what we are experiencing is a demand shock coming from a new category of participant in the commodities futures markets
7368309 lets not make any accusations until we have some information
7368310 when were speaking with the government were speaking about everything from environmental issue that affect our business to energy supply within canada and abroad as well as capital and jobs and economic impact
7368311 when youre asking did we speak about the oil sands i think yes we would definitely have been speaking about the oil sands and our business
7368312 these kinds of meetings and exchanges happen all the time
7368313 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7368314 the concept of luxury travel and the hotel experience that affluent consumers seek has evolved over the years and even now continues to redefine itself
7368315 what remains constant about our best of the best award recipients is their spirited enthusiasm singular passion for delivering an unparalleled experience and an unwavering commitment to serving both the client and our member travel agencies we are proud to recognize those hotels that are stand outs in particular areas of excellence
7368316 during the world cup circuit it would not be possible to spend time with the team and get together for social activities
7368317 the location alone is amazing right in queenstowns historic precinct on marine parade and just metres from the shores of lake wakatipu
7368318 its a fantastic use of a heritage building the restaurant is modelled in the style of an old villa with lots of rooms cosy nooks and outside seating plus it incorporates all the classic goodbars touches granite bartops leather couches patterned wallpaper lots of velvet white linen tablecloths and fireplaces
7368319 our wanaka restaurant has been very successful and a good testing ground so when we came across the queenstown location we jumped at the chance to expand
7368320 its about freedom to create the perfect individual flavour combinations based on diners personal preferences people can choose to have their meat cooked on woodburning grills which i think gives it the real x factor
7368321 its a total diss to senator clinton in my opinion
7368322 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7368323 the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you liked the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain
7368324 lets be honest its the most disastrous presidency weve had in modern american history and john mccain has said there are not a lot of significant issues that he disagrees with george w bush on

7368328 ok then go for it and trust in your gear and yourself
7368329 can i do what i have to do get to somewhere safer
7368330 i cant date him ill run over him just like cami
7368331 sticking a needle into the hair follicle and running so much current along it that everything fries
7368332 for my part and in my campaign there will be no mud thrown from my direction from my camp
7368333 i will not throw mud and i know i will be blessed because i will not be interrupted by negativism that may be circulating i hope this will be a clean race like it was when i ran in 2005 against obie salinas who was a gentleman with me all the way we ran a good clean campaign i am going to ask the public to keep it clean
7368334 ms ram n was chosen today to uphold core values of trust responsibility and commitment to public service
7368335 out of 66 applicants she is what we consider the best of the best
7368336 it isnt by accident that the district had 12 exemplary and 15 recognized campuses last year or that we had six schools named in texas monthlys best public schools in texas list or that 33 schools received for high academic accomplishments or that we have two high schools who have been awarded the or two high schools named in newsweek magazine among the top five percent of schools in the nation
7368337 but it was through others efforts that i survived and that i am who i am today
7368338 the thing of which i am most proud is the tremendous academic success
7368339 i dont know how many of you read the papers but this holding up positive newspaper articles doesnt happen by accident the academic successes this district experienced this year are beyond expectations people ask me how did it happen i told them we are not cheating we just work hard
7368340 no longer do campus principals get calls from board members or powerful individuals in central office telling them who to hire who to fire who belongs who doesnt belong who to promote who not to promote what to do what not to do
7368341 it was so bad at one time that principals couldnt move a teacher from one grade to another grade without getting a call from somebody
7368342 you people in the school business know what i am talking about
7368343 i can honestly say that the majority of that has stopped
7368344 now go back in time and even today do you think that the sister the friend the daughter of any board member would be in a portable
7368345 but this is what i am all about fairness it is a need that is why we passed the bond issue so someday all of our children will be in a beautiful school
7368346 i remember saying at the first community meeting we had last fall on the bond issue that the importance of this bond issue is so close to my heart that even if i lose my election but we passed the bond issue i would be satisfied
7368347 part of the success of the bond issue was the commitment of the citizens oversight committee
7368348 we knew it was important for the community to help us with the need for a bond issue we were lucky to have the leadership that we had people like dr francisco guajardo norma guerra bryant morrison ver nica s enz and many many others they helped convince the community that your children and my children deserved better than portable buildings
7368349 for my part and in my campaign there will be no mud thrown from my direction from my camp
7368350 i will not throw mud and i know i will be blessed because i will not be interrupted by negativism that may be circulating i hope this will be a clean race like it was when i ran in 2005 against obie salinas who was a gentleman with me all the way we ran a good clean campaign i am going to ask the public to keep it clean
7368351 you know who i am i dont have to convince you of who i am
7368352 a person like me doesnt change i am still the same person you elected three and a half years ago
7368353 welcome teachers new teachers and principals to the ecisd where educational excellence abounds said garza
7368354 i want to especially welcome all of our new teachers and tell you that you have chosen to come work at the best school district south of san antonio
7368355 of those 167 teachers 68 are brand new to the teaching profession and 99 are experienced teachers who have chosen to come work in this great school district
7368356 the ecisd is charged with educating our children and you are the front line the link in the chain on which everything else depends
7368357 learning happens one child at a time one classroom at a time and you are in charge of that process
7368358 everyone at the ecisd supports you everything we do at the ecisd is intended to support learning
7368359 as teachers you take on one of the largest social challenges you teach our students how to learn
7368360 it may not sound like much to some people but in fact its the single most important skill we can teach students in order to enable them to become lifelong learners
7368361 last year was a good year for our schools this year is going to be an even better year
7368362 it isnt by accident that the district had 12 exemplary and 15 recognized campuses last year or that we had six schools named in texas monthlys best public schools in texas list or that 33 schools received gold performance acknowledgments for high academic performance or that we have two high schools who have been awarded the college board inspiration award or two high schools named in newsweek magazine among the top five percent of schools in the nation
7368363 these things dont just happen by accident they happen because you make them happen
7368364 at 211 degrees water is hot at 212 degrees just one degree more water boils and with boiling water comes steam and with steam you can power a train
7368365 because of what you did our students learned and their success is yours too its amazing what you can do when you turn it up a notch
7368366 outstanding teachers go out of their way to boost the self esteem of their students
7368367 if students believe in themselves it is amazing what they can accomplish
7368368 ive come to realize that success or failure as a teacher is not about how you look or how you dress or how educated you are but rather how you think if you think small the results will be minimal if you think big and push for high expectations the results will be big
7368369 success comes through teamwork your schools did not accomplish what they did last year because of your principal doing it alone
7368370 the accomplishments came because all of you on your respective campuses became one heartbeat together this is what brought your campus elementary and secondary alike success
7368371 as a team you must remain focused you put aside your own individual needs and set your eyes on teaching your students to learn not matter how great the challenge
7368372 teaching children is one of the most difficult jobs there is
7368373 the challenges are immense the distractions are many the possibility for failure is ever present
7368374 we can sit back and say that the children will never learn no matter what we do and they wont because we dont care enough to try
7368375 or we can stand up and say today there will be learning in this classroom
7368376 the trek to success begins with each one of us
7368377 so in the 2008 2009 school year we are turning it up another notch
7368378 if we hinge our goal on this theme and make it a part of our daily lives we are going to see big results more of our recognized schools will become exemplary and our middle school and high schools will rise to occasion as well
7368379 im just a plowhand from arkansas but i have learned how to hold a team together how to lift some men up how to calm down others until finally theyve got one heartbeat together a team
7368380 there are three things i believe if anything goes bad i did it if anything goes semi good then we did it if anything goes real good then you did it it takes that kind of vision and commitment to student success to make learning happen one student at a time
7368381 ms ram n was chosen today to uphold core values of trust responsibility and commitment to public service
7368382 out of 66 applicants she is what we consider the best of the best
7368383 ms ram n together with the commission have a lot of work to do to restore public trust and restore ethical behavior to the department hopefully we can all stand together
7368384 it is with great honor and humility that i accept this position
7368385 never hesitate to ask for help beyond her own knowledge
7368386 plans organizes coordinates and manages federal state and county elections and all facets of the voter registration processes in accordance with the texas election code and other applicable federal state and local laws and regulations including administrative direction from the texas secretary of state
7368387 i want to make sure the hidalgo county elections department is second to none
7368388 those who are sworn to uphold the laws are equally bound to follow them
7368389 an injustice has been recognized and accepted by this former agents admission today
7368390 i strongly urge all affordable housing providers serving rural areas of south texas to attend this workshop so they can determine their eligibility and how to apply for the program
7368391 the funds are provided by tdhca through its contract for deed conversion program to help colonia residents achieve homeownership by converting their contracts for deed to conventional deeds of trust
7368392 this program opens the door to homeownership and the promise of a better way of life for many of our most vulnerable neighbors
7368393 i am extremely concerned that many affordable housing providers who qualify will not take this opportunity to learn how to access this program
7368394 we are still out in the field conducting our assessments hidalgo county pumping crews have been dispatched to four locations at this time and other resources will be identified and mobilized soon
7368395 recent flooding across the state has devastated communities damaging homes and public buildings and threatening livestock and agriculture
7368396 state resources and volunteer organizations are on site providing assistance local officials and first responders have done an outstanding job in protecting our citizens during these dangerous and damaging floods
7368397 revenue estimates look good for the next biennium however it is too early to discuss the size of a surplus
7368398 there are many competing interests for state funding and we must prioritize health and human services public education higher education and an estimated 14 billion needed to pay down property taxes
7368399 we must ensure that the needs of students with special needs are met
7368400 adequate state funding is critical to ensure the success of special education programs teachers should participate in appropriate continuing education and the requirements of the individuals with disabilities education act idea must be implemented adequately
7368401 when faced with a decision to challenge the school districts ruling regarding a student with special needs the high cost of legal fees often is prohibitive for low and middle income families to seek this route
7368402 the importance of giving parents ample resources and support to communicate effectively with the school districts and preclude expensive litigation
7368403 texas is definitely on the cutting edge of online certification testing in the u s
7368404 teachers in texas are just finding it much more convenient
7368405 its the method of preference for most teachers they like the quick scoring turnaround
7368406 legislation of this type would certainly provide orca with the tool kit needed to address long standing challenges facing rural and border communities and help those communities to increase their competitiveness
7368407 a successor to sb 1485 is very necessary and i look forward to working with you your staff orca and others on creating the very best programs possible
7368408 each day when they put on their uniforms our law enforcement officers place themselves in harms way to protect and serve the people of texas in turn texans should have the opportunity to do their part to help these officers in their time of need
7368409 the blue alert program will be a powerful tool that leverages the eyes and ears of many toward the apprehension of criminals who threaten our protectors
7368410 the faculty are our greatest asset and we want a smooth transition for them
7368411 we want to build up faculty and want to enhance their experience here we want to make sure that the investment we put forth in getting them here pays great return for our students because they are most important
7368412 as part of the universitys strategic direction we want to empower our new faculty through the support of this program to meet the learning needs of students
7368413 i hope that by my being here today that you are better able to understand the lives of some utpa students
7368414 as professors you have the power to empower befriend mentor and guide students
7368415 i think its really helpful to get to know other faculty who are coming to the same place and who are sharing the same concerns and excitement
7368416 i think its nice to get a heads up in whats happening across the university
7368417 this program gives us a good head start and facilitates a smooth transition into the university
7368418 i think the program will be very useful because it will give us a good idea of what expectations are its also very nice to have this one place where you get the opportunity to meet a variety of people from different offices

7368450 first thing we need to see is a life jacket for each person on board
7368451 upon doing those boardings thats when we start noticing indications of alcohol being on board and perhaps intoxication
7368452 and i suspect thats done to a little bit of increased presence as well as the few good weather days that weve had
7368453 obviously youre gonna have a few adult beverages when youre out boating and enjoy that a little bit if thats what you like to do
7368454 but you have to be reasonable and responsible when youre out boating because you have to act in the safety of your family and your friends that are along with you

7368565 after i fell behind this morning i just tried to come out and make something happen and i felt like i did
7368566 but i guess i just caught him on the wrong day
7368567 i had the lead twice and i gave it up both times leaving two balls over the plate a game like sundays with the importance of the game you cant allow that to happen our guys fought back and played a heck of a game theyve been picking me up the past two weeks and i didnt pick them up sunday we needed this one and i didnt come through
7368568 when he was pitching to crisp and cora i thought he threw his second best pitch a lot of times his curveball
7368569 he got himself into trouble with his curveball a little bit instead of throwing his best pitch which is his fastball
7368570 the ball beat him home and 95 per cent or 100 per cent of the time theyre going to call him out

7368576 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
7368577 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 230 feet per year
7368578 snow and glacial ice melting provide a very important source for fresh water for irrigation energy and drinking water downstream
7368579 the drier areas are becoming drier while the wetter areas are becoming wetter
7368580 in the past the rivers had a fairly constant flow throughout the summer due to melt water now you have a lot of rain in the spring and then you have fairly dry conditions throughout the rest of the summer
7368581 maybe before your district was suffering from one flash flood every season and that was perhaps what people managed to cope with but if you get three or four or five flash floods maybe thats too much the question is how much more can people tolerate without losing their basis for livelihood
7368582 lets tell them what we did we shopped till we dropped

7368586 what those gold medals tell us about a very divided britain
7368587 according to the ideals of love and marriage to which most of us subscribe deepening affection and closeness are supposed to coexist with a dependable satisfying sex life however the difficulty millions of couples have in combining closeness with sexual enthusiasm is evident im convinced that couples who openly confront the difficulties of combining intimacy and passion are the ones most likely to thrive it is crucial to acknowledge that closeness and sexual desire are not one and the same but rather two separate yet interacting experiences
7368588 before we have sex together i want us to aim to always talk about sex honestly and freely even when it seems weird i feel like thats important for both our physical and emotional safety as well as so that we can have really great sex
7368589 im feeling like this would feel even better with something fuller maybe your hands
7368590 im having a hard time working out the difference between our reality and what i see in porn
7368591 i love being with you and i love how you give me clues about what you like with your body i think things could be even better though if you could also tell me with words sometimes what you like or want
7368592 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7368593 i dont want my grandchildrens history teacher tell them that in 2008 hillary clinton ran a fairly strong race but then lost all her support when it came down to the final hurdle
7368594 what she is saying is that she is no longer asking you to vote for me

7368612 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7368613 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7368614 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7368615 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7368616 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7368617 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7368618 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7368619 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7368620 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7368621 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7368622 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7368623 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7368624 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7368625 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7368626 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7368627 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7368628 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7368629 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7368630 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7368631 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7368632 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7368633 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7368634 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7368635 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7368636 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7368637 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7368638 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7368639 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7368640 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7368641 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7368642 the stitches are gone i started rehab doing cardio lifting
7368643 i want to put the pedal to the metal but they wont let me
7368644 theyre making me take it pretty slow and be pretty consistent the healing time is something that you cant speed up
7368645 we knew that everyone knew that it just was a thing where most people it doesnt affect it wasnt affecting me so if nothing is broke you dont fix it then something happened in practice that second day of camp the disc started moving and that caused some problems
7368646 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7368647 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7368648 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7368649 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7368650 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7368651 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7368652 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7368653 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7368654 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7368655 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7368656 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7368657 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7368658 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7368659 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7368660 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7368661 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7368662 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7368663 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7368664 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7368665 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7368666 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7368667 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7368668 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7368669 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7368670 this is a planning took where all things are going
7368671 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7368672 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7368673 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7368674 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7368675 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7368676 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7368677 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7368678 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7368679 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7368680 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7368681 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7368682 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7368683 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7368684 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7368685 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7368686 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7368687 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7368688 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7368689 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7368690 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7368691 i also wondered why the 911 hijackers spent a weekend in las vegas gambling and boozing it up global voices online kyrgyzstan american basketball players to visit kyrgyzstan foodcourtlunch com dear togo uzbekistan armenia tajikistan and kyrgyzstan click on pic

7368694 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7368695 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7368696 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7368697 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7368698 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7368699 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7368700 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7368701 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7368702 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7368703 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7368704 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7368705 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7368706 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7368707 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7368708 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7368709 rare endangered and in need of your help since the only way to preserve these living artifacts and their incredible genetic resources is to grow them

7368715 offsetting schemes are now widely acknowledged to be problematic responses to the challenge of climate change most significantly in offsetting schemes commercial advantage and environmental benefits have become entangled to the extent that a crisis of legitimacy has occurred
7368716 offsetting schemes are conceptually problematic they have arisen not from attempts by environmentalists and climate scientists to design an appropriate response to climate change but from politicians and business executives trying to meet the demands for action while preserving the commercial status quo
7368717 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
7368718 people in a burning house cannot afford to lose time in an argument
7368719 we have to speed up the pace the negotiations here in accra must deliver concrete results about what technologies will be used to cut emissions
7368720 the erosion has been going on for years but it is being accelerated by sea level rise so we have to act earlier than we would have had to
7368721 its about balancing the interests of the site and finding the most sensible solution
7368722 weve got to bear in mind the impacts of climate change such as increased storminess
7368723 an eloquent defender of working families and opponent of the bush administrations war on workers
7368724 has been a friend to working americans throughout his public life standing up and fighting alongside us for the right to organize for living wages for family medical leave for workplace safety and for a strong social security system
7368725 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production
7368726 instead they are either lending the rent out through the wholesale money markets or using it to buy stakes in banks or property in heavily oil dependent countries
7368727 ring fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all
7368728 part of the money raised should be used to immediately help those struggling with rising fuel bills and should be particularly targeted at families in or facing fuel poverty
7368729 however the best strategy to eliminate fuel poverty forever is to ensure every home is insulated and energy efficient to the highest standards
7368730 therefore much of the money raised should be used to kickstart a national programme of home energy efficiency and installing renewable energy starting with the homes of the fuel poor
7368731 himalayan glaciers are retreating more rapidly than anywhere else in the world
7368732 the glaciers retreat is enormous up to 230 feet per year

7368737 i am in a place where i could start dating again but to be honest i dont even know how right now my focus is on getting back to work and just being a dad

7368758 but this is unique we dont know of a quiver like this anywhere else in the world
7368759 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7368760 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7368761 the site is exactly at the point where the glacier responds most sensitively to short term climate change and temperature variations
7368762 so if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7368763 but what we do know is that the climate has fluctuated throughout history in the past the driving force for the changes was the earths orbital pattern now the driving force is green house gas emissions
7368764 if leather is exposed to the weather to sun wind and rain it disintegrates almost immediately bit by bit the neolithic way of life is being revealed
7368765 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7368766 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7368767 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future
7368768 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there
7368769 the problem with that is that the producers are not buying and consuming anything like that part of the worlds production

7368778 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7368779 now these archaeological findings seem to fit quite nicely with our glacier reconstructions
7368780 this is very important in the debate about climate change in the past the present and also in the future
7368781 up to then we had always thought the alps were not used that people never went there
7368782 around the country for the few people who are still undecided one of the reasons theyre undecided is because they have questions about baracks youth his so called inexperience
7368783 having someone like joe biden with his grey hairs literally and figuratively answers the question of experience for those who are concerned about experience
7368784 hes going to take on the republican ticket frontally and he knows john mccain very well and theres not going to be very much that john mccain can say during this campaign that joe biden doesnt know
7368785 this agreement between luxottica and disability works australia is an excellent example of how employers can take pro active steps to give people with disabilities a fair go in the open labour market
7368786 this mou will provide significant opportunities for people in bennelong and means more opportunities for people with disability to participate in society and to reach their full potential
7368787 showcasing employers like luxottica who are leading the way in providing flexible and adaptable work opportunities will help to overcome prejudices and stereotypes often held by employers
7368788 the strategy will provide clear and practical steps that the rudd government can put in place to overcome barriers that make it harder for people with disability and mental illness to gain and keep work
7368789 the anangu leadership should be praised for leading their communities towards significant improvements in housing while ensuring the protection of anangu land
7368790 i am very pleased these leases have been supported so we can tackle the unacceptable overcrowding highlighted by commissioner ted mullighan
7368791 this is a major development for tackling disadvantage on the apy lands
7368792 the commonwealth can now move forward on our 25 million commitment and start building and upgrading housing in apy communities
7368793 decent housing is central to community safety and improving health education and living standards in indigenous communities
7368794 these leases will ensure that the new and improved houses are properly maintained and repaired by the south australian public housing authority and that relevant social support services are available to tenants
7368795 there will also be new work and training opportunities for indigenous australians in the construction and maintenance of the new and upgraded houses
7368796 we chose to twist the campaign into a dress down and stress down day at biggera waters
7368797 staff wore casual dress and brought along their favourite comfort food there were lots of chocolate warm drinks as well as ideas on how to people can make small changes to improve their lives however the most important thing for us was ensuring all our customers were well looked after
7368798 our staff are very community focused and it was a fun way for us to make a contribution to a good cause
7368799 other centrelink offices even created a relaxation room to de stress in and some staff wore their slippers into work
7368800 its brilliant that centrelink have come on board for the first year of stress down 24 7
7368801 one of the biggest challenges we have at lifeline is recruiting volunteer telephone counsellors the money centrelink has kindly donated will go some way to addressing this issue
7368802 the government in the past five years particularly has not really embraced the business agenda thoroughly enough the brown premiership has carried on that trend and then youve got all the economic pressures and some of the tax cock ups as well
7368803 in reality there is very little room to move fiscally
7368804 las puertas se abren como si se corrieran del paso y cuando est n cerradas casi
7368805 it is clear from my discussions that global financial markets are still facing many challenges with a lack of counterparty trust continuing to affect some transactions
7368806 while some jurisdictions have struggled with these challenges both the nyse and nasdaq confirmed the view in the u s and beyond that australia has a robust regulatory structure that has worked well in current circumstances
7368807 both u s supervising bodies endorsed the governments considered and consultative approach in responding to market volatility
7368808 the recommendations put forward in this report when implemented will have the potential to significantly improve the development of tax measures and are consistent with the governments commitments to give australians a greater say in government decision making
7368809 the panel recommends more consultation at every stage of the tax design process including before the government announces its decision to legislate and the establishment of a tri partite team comprising treasury the ato and the private sector to develop tax measures
7368810 by acting on the recommendations in this report the government is delivering on a key election commitment to respond to community concern on the uncertainty created by the former governments failure to implement tax changes in a timely way
7368811 the research will fill important gaps and progress knowledge to inform prevention programs
7368812 the research projects will examine the management of middle ear disease and hearing loss in aboriginal children up to five years old target school age children and young people with prevention education and identify enablers and barriers to the use of hearing protection in the workplace
7368813 hearing loss costs the australian community about 11 75 billion a year
7368814 the hearing loss prevention program tackles the burden of preventable hearing loss in the australian community and targets young people aboriginal and torres strait islander people and people in the workplace
7368815 this week provides an opportunity for people to get information about services available and free hearing screenings at many hearing centres across the nation
7368816 im not here to be a role model personality im here to be in the business of fucking rock and roll being in the business of rock and roll means having an attitude being sexy being edgy and being unapologetic unless i do something wrong i look up to people like joan jett pat benatar freddie mercury and cyndi lauper i want to have that same type of appeal if people want a role model they can have miley cyrus

7368828 australia is a world leader in mining and mining related industries australian expertise and investment can help improve safety efficiency and yields
7368829 during my recent visit to china i had numerous discussions with chinese ministers and officials all of whom indicated a strong willingness to work with australia on the development of clean coal and other environmental technology to help china deal with its high pollution levels and to address climate change
7368830 inner mongolia will become an increasingly important coal production base in north china inefficient exploitation and utilisation of resources to date has resulted in poor returns in the past and this is where australian capability and companies like crest can make a difference
7368831 chinas rising energy demands represent an excellent opportunity for innovative australian companies like crest to not only help china achieve its goals but in turn expand trade and create jobs for australians

7368840 this agreement between australia and new zealand brings to fruition the vision of a regional enc co ordination centre this will result in consistent quality information with guaranteed data integrity that is internationally available to mariners
7368841 this agreement formally establishes the co operation within the south west pacific region and is the culmination of several years of work to produce and distribute new zealand electronic charts
7368842 this is a further example of the close co operation between australia and new zealand on hydrographic surveying and charting and is a step forward in the achievement of enc coverage in the south west pacific region
7368843 headquarters northern command has been operational for 20 years continuing with the role of providing protection to the north
7368844 the headquarters has been pivotal in not only providing support to the darwin community but all territorians and 10 years ago headquarters northern command was granted freedom of entry to the city of darwin
7368845 to be granted a freedom of entry is a privilege and signifies the mutual trust between a city and a military unit today that right was again exercised and i know that the ties between defence and the territory will continue to develop and strengthen
7368846 with the support of the darwin community the personnel from norcom are able to undertake work such as operation resolute
7368847 this is the australian defence forces contribution to the whole of government approach to maritime security and is responsible for co ordinating army navy and air force patrols in an area that is equal to 10 of the earths surface
7368848 we have moved these soldiers back to australia to ensure they continue to receive the best medical care available while both men have serious injuries they are in good spirits

7368855 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7368856 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7368857 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear but after listening to the explanation i am convinced this is the right procedure the right way to go
7368858 we have played for a long period of time good baseball
7368859 right now is not the time to not be executing pitches its just not the time but we are in a good spot
7368860 thats one thing that long grueling schedule will bring to light youve got to use everybody
7368861 we need all the wins we can get because were in a real battle right now weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7368862 it was a big win because the blue jays have been playing great and they are one of the teams trying to catch us
7368863 they have played us very well too so to be able to finally win a few games here is huge for us
7368864 the bottom line is that this loss is my fault
7368865 one of the things i was very pleased with us last year is that we finished games
7368866 we finished the season extremely well and we have to continue to do that
7368867 hopefully this year we can start off a lot stronger and a lot faster than weve done as far as the season goes and also at the beginning of games
7368868 if we do have the intangible qualities as our team had last year with the talent we have then we have a chance at some point to be a good football team during the course of this season
7368869 i definitely believe we can play with teams like auburn and alabama last year we played well against tennessee and south carolina but felt like we let those games get away from us late we believe we can be better and win those games this year
7368870 we won eight games and went to the liberty bowl but we want to go out and prove we are even better this year
7368871 weve got more national championships we got more players in the pros so our talent level in this conference is the best in the country
7368872 the quality of our coaches is the best in the country if youre going to compete in this conference youve got to prepare well and youve got to play well every week
7368873 its really great croom cares about us as a man and a person both on and off the field
7368874 we take it as a great opportunity to play for the first black head coach in the sec what hes doing now is opening doors for a lot of people
7368875 thats what is great about coach croom he doesnt sugar coat things
7368876 hell tell you when you need to be working harder and in which areas you need to improve
7368877 we had a good spring and if we have good two a days we can look forward to a good opener against louisiana tech
7368878 hopefully well get off to a good start and keep it rolling but we have to focus on each game without looking ahead
7368879 some people need to go home so one boat is going to return
7368880 others are going to stay here for a month but overall were trying to create an ongoing ferry service that brings in people and supplies from cyprus to gaza this is not a one time attempt
7368881 they are going to take 10 palestinian students with them
7368882 the idea is to get them out of gaza to cyprus and then off to universities elsewhere
7368883 it was political the point was to break the siege and change israeli policy in gaza it wasnt a one time thing we are going to continue bringing boats into gaza and those will have humanitarian assistance on board
7368884 they let these two boats in so i dont see why they wouldnt let a third one in
7368885 were trying to open gaza up to the outside world in an additional gesture of solidarity with the residents of gaza some 25 of the humanitarian volunteers are scheduled to go out to sea with gaza fishermen on monday
7368886 there is no change in israeli policy and there is no need for the port since the palestinians are getting everything they need via the land based crossings
7368887 the quickest way to get over something is just forget about it
7368888 everybody always says you always have to fail to succeed when you fail get rid of it and dont let anyone else know that you failed
7368889 but i know weve got to win more than were winning now im not interested in getting out though i plan on getting this thing back to where it ought to be and go on from there

7368962 a deeper question to emerge from the above is this exactly whose interest is being served by the deliberate attempt of various non greenhouse theorists to blur and fog this debate
7368963 the latest example of which is the weekend australian piece by dr marohasy why have they not openly and honest provided a full disclosure of the rainfall trends inflows and statistics behind the story why the need for a sleight of hand in which the data are very selectively presented and interpreted

7369143 those are things we have to pay attention to but i think it is important not to swing the pendulum too much in an alarmist fashion
7369144 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic
7369145 but i do see security concerns that will arise as you have nations compete for resources as you have nations compete for passage as you have commercial interests competing for passage through the area all of those have a security element and i think we just have to have a good discussion about it
7369146 if we believed we have solved the problem we are almost guaranteeing it will come back you cant take your eye off the ball in this kind of a situation
7369147 we are seeing a team now that is closer knit than maybe ever before
7369148 those days are gone we are working hand in hand
7369149 we are seeing now a synergy that is really strong
7369150 on any given day one of them will be our highest priority
7369151 what keeps me awake is making sure that our team is focused on the many threats out there and not taking any one for granted not leaving any one unobserved
7369152 we have to get it right so we can help people quickly we want to optimize the humanitarian aid effort and bring in the right stuff to the right place at the right time
7369153 we express our gratitude for your help and will never forget what you have done to help us in our time of need
7369154 there is an agreement between two heads of state and there has to be compliance
7369155 my assessment is that the russian withdrawal is now slower than it ought to be the russians need to do what they said they were going to do almost a week ago and withdraw
7369156 i d better look at that you dont want to cause a fire
7369157 you just scared my girlfriend out of getting a tattoo
7369158 despite the handlers best efforts there are always moments of political nakedness during a campaign when the voters see the candidates as they really are those moments can determine the outcome
7369159 last night led by every sector of civil society the venezuelan people rose up to defend democracy in their country
7369160 serve as a bridge between the nations political parties and all civil society groups
7369161 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7369162 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7369163 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7369164 we should have had a boston tea party over this
7369165 i saw a bug like the one we saw at the gym that one time
7369166 o campo ruim mas temos que nos adaptar precisamos explorar a bola parada e os cruzamentos para o marcel
7369167 a bola quicou o nilmar acreditou e acabou marcando admito que errei me precipitei no lance
7369168 nosso time melhorou mas precisamos ficar atentos na defesa tivemos uma bobeira e sofremos o gol
7369169 n s sab amos que precis vamos reagir depois da derrota para o internacional precis vamos mostrar nossas condi es e um bom jogo era fundamental para isso ganhamos for a e estamos mais pr ximos da parte de cima da tabela
7369170 minha viv ncia no futebol me diz que as pessoas que me criticam em uma derrota s o as mesmas que v o me elogiar quando meu time vence n o podemos avaliar nosso trabalho por um ou outro resultado
7369171 o nico ponto negativo da rea o do palmeiras no campeonato brasileiro que o time alviverde voltou a mostrar neste domingo um problema cr nico os dois gols da portuguesa foram marcados no segundo tempo ambos anotados pelo atacante jonas em bolas a reas
7369172 n o temos nem o que falar sobre o primeiro tempo deu tudo errado at come amos bem mas de repente o palmeiras come ou a fazer os gols e n s n o conseguimos reagir complicado jogar assim
7369173 o primeiro tempo foi um apag o total n s est vamos jogando bem mas a come amos a errar e deixamos o palmeiras construir o resultado conversamos no intervalo e dissemos que precis vamos apagar isso conseguimos mas claro que o melhor seria n o ter feito um primeiro tempo t o ruim
7369174 sempre mais complicado jogar quando voc est em uma situa o complicada na tabela mas n s tentamos reagir aproveitamos que o palmeiras ficou um pouco no campo deles e ganhamos espa o infelizmente j n o dava mais tempo
7369175 global warming will leave things like this in the dust the natural oscillations here are nothing like what we would expect to see with global warming
7369176 it was a very nice service the service went well
7369177 they showed the love and support of the family we all enjoyed it we felt comforted for it
7369178 just how many years of your life did you spend wasting on practice for this event dont you feel a complete goose
7369179 according to recent medical studies at tufts university there is now proof that there is one simple thing you can do for a few minutes a day that will absolutely reverse the 10 major signs of aging
7369180 this one thing can increase your energy level by more than 100 increase your strength by more than 200 greatly enhance your sex life lower your blood pressure and cholesterol raise your metabolism lower your risk for cancer and heart disease add years to your life and make the years ahead a lot more enjoyable
7369181 im talking about strength training and the tufts studies revealed you only need to engage in it for 20 to 30 minutes at a time three to four days a week in order to increase your energy level by more than 100
7369182 add to that list and include property developers industrial product designers furniture manufacturers cabinet makers stair specialists and so on
7369183 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7369184 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7369185 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7369186 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7369187 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7369188 sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on theyre in another world and you cannot enter
7369189 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7369190 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7369191 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7369192 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall
7369193 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7369194 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7369195 the problem is that the higher the burden of taxation the less opportunity there is for growth
7369196 if you want to get further growth then the state has got to take less from people in tax as you reduce the levels of taxation you will get growth
7369197 just as the country is having to tighten its belt clearly we are going to have to look at priorities for public expenditure
7369198 we have reached the limits and in my view we have got to make economies i think we have reached the end of the road
7369199 we are trying to raise the profile but we are finding it very difficult to get recognition they see women as always being the victims never the perpetrator
7369200 it is totally unreported we are trying to flag this up and say please see there is a need for services we need to do a pilot project and get statistics
7369201 there should be an equivalent agency to help men as there is for women and children i wrote to the minister and got a reply back on 7 may saying there is no need for such a service and it is covered by things like victim support
7369202 i dont think thats correct and i want to continue to press him and the scottish government and get a credible response to this to make sure there is a proper dedicated facility
7369203 a zero tolerance approach to all forms of domestic abuse
7369204 i was frequently threatened with knives but she never actually picked one up
7369205 she would rain punches on me and pull my head about by a handful of hair and scream abuse into my ear
7369206 it was like a curtain coming down i remember the room darkening apparently i attacked her
7369207 my eyes suffer terribly every time i chop onions i look like a scot coming out of murrayfield after a beating by england ive tried all of the old wives tales to no effect if they have finally nailed the problem with this invention i would be very impressed
7369208 i would love to see my customers faces though if they were greeted at the door by a madman in a huge pair of goggles
7369209 strong onions do make your eyes run even when youre used to them but i think id get a few laughs if i turned up to work wearing goggles im not sure theyre something that will take off in professional kitchens
7369210 if you switch on american tv you see all these gadgets most of them would be no use at all
7369211 there are certain things which are actually a great help such as a machine we have to take the zest of citrus fruit and it saves us a lot of time but most of the things on the market are useless
7369212 we do sell a metal bar which helps people get the smell of onions off their hands and that is very popular so i think the goggles would be too
7369213 two years ago the mca itself commissioned a study into salary levels but decided not to accept the findings
7369214 since then pay rewards have been below inflation there has been no offer made by the agency
7369215 the reason we are saying this is that clearly the coastguards have local knowledge and expertise which will not be there during the strike
7369216 i think there will be an impact because of the lack of local knowledge but how far that is i cannot say
7369217 utterly delightful an hour with david odoherty fills the world with laughter and charm and sends you home on a wave of happiness
7369218 its been a curious year for the fringe in that it seems a lot of time has been spent talking about split ups but that has nothing to do with us our job is to explore the dark recesses of our minds and to come up with the best shows we possibly can
7369219 i just really want the focus to go back to the work rather than people talking about awards and reviews and how much money everything costs
7369220 my whole career has been based on the fact i once had an arsehole of a husband i should be thanking him but im not going to
7369221 that is why i got into comedy i realised i could do anything i wanted
7369222 if i dont work hard i could be back in customer service
7369223 we have never been particularly keen on the award but if someone has to win then its better that its someone with an individual show at an independent venue
7369224 some of the falls in population have taken place in already threatened colonies the weather has compounded an already bleak picture of decline probably caused by habitat loss
7369225 some of the bigger species will be able to bounce back but the rare species especially those later on the wing like the small blue have probably taken the biggest hit
7369226 butterflies are very fragile and they succumb to heavy rain and strong winds next years butterflies are out at the moment as baby caterpillars and it may well be that very heavy rain washes off eggs and in particular young caterpillars or they get diseases
7369227 some species have managed to overcome the odds and have had excellent flight seasons overall though it has been a dreadful year probably the worst in my 45 year experience
7369228 look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay this is an exceptionally brilliant nation at the same time a small nation
7369229 scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7369230 what i would say to them is do irish athletes want to rejoin the uk and be part of the uk team do we want to get rid of the gb team and have a european team because a european team would sweep the board you have to think about whether or not its appropriate in the level you represent your own country in i think its quite right you represent your own country
7369231 before anything like that could be discussed hed have to look at the facilities and resources in scotland at the moment we dont have an international facility for cycling we dont have the coaching or anything else in place
7369232 for him to call for a scottish olympic team at this stage is ridiculous i wouldnt have three gold medals hanging round my neck if i wasnt part of the british team im a scottish athlete in a british team and im proud to be a british athlete
7369233 the government would have to invest serious money in sport before they could start thinking of having their own team in the olympics
7369234 theres nothing i love more than going home to edinburgh but i havent lived in scotland for nine years there just arent the facilities to train there if there were then i would live there but like craig maclean and ross edgar who are the other scottish cyclists on the british team i have to be based in manchester
7369235 this is nothing to do with sport everything to do with politics
7369236 only independent nations as recognised by the international community can have national olympic committee status bestowed on them
7369237 im absolutely passionate about scotland and i want scotland to do well but im also exceptionally proud of team gbs performance in the olympics i dont see why i should be asked to make a choice between those two
7369238 why would chris hoy want to leave the best cycling team in the world
7369239 we can say with one patriot voice it is a great time to be british
7369240 we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport sport is coming home
7369241 when i left britain it was all recession recession recession and weve come back to a country overwhelmed by olympic success
7369242 if they cant fit 40 000 people in why did they issue that many tickets
7369243 this is not a popular idea not only do all the national supporters associations oppose this but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team
7369244 scotland has a long international footballing tradition and i would not do anything to jeopardise that team gb should include a football team but not at the expense of scotlands football team it would be wrong to gamble with the identity of scotlands football team
7369245 we will see who wants to be part of this and then we will get a manager that everybody will be happy with and i know alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe and i have spoken to him about it
7369246 but last night in a fit of ecstatic romantic frenzy cathy and i worked out how to produce engenu like pages on the spot
7369247 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
7369248 so how did you help jane doe in her time of need
7369249 i thought the hardware part was a husk while the juicy parts were tossed away with the spinout
7369250 the meat they clearcube had was their existing customer relationships in an ongoing business and an optimized hardware for blades
7369251 it was much less a loss than all of us anticipated
7369252 it was discount discount discount to make revenue then you turn around and youre not making any money
7369253 kabarkanlah kepada orang orang munafik bahawa mereka akan mendapat siksaan yang pedih
7369254 perumpamaan orang orang yang mengambil pelindung pelindung selain allah adalah seperti labah labah yang membuat rumahnya dan sesungguhnya rumah yang paling lemah adalah rumah labah labah kalau mereka mengetahui
7369255 kita akan bekerjasama sepenuhnya dengan amerika dalam kempen menentang keganasan
7369256 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah nescaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
7369257 its easy to see that as disrespect and some hillary loyalists are going to resent it
7369258 but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7369259 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7369260 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7369261 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7369262 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7369263 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7369264 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7369265 we are blessed by the fact that our friend and neighbour is also our number one supplier of foreign oil
7369266 the amount of energy that you have to use to get that oil out of the ground is such that it actually creates a much greater impact on climate change as well as using much more energy than even traditional petroleum
7369267 if american mayors want to send their money to unstable undemocratic countries in the middle east instead of to canada that will be their call if they want to pay a premium for iranian saudi iraqi oil that will be their call
7369268 we have gathered today to get back our land money cannot compensate our loss
7369269 it was an important area and a lot of glasgows religious history is shaped by happenings there
7369270 the fringe frenzy has been cancelled for this year with the issues which we have experienced in 2008 we have deemed this the most pertinent route to take
7369271 in my opinion old men who want to marry girls at the age of their granddaughters are mentally sick and need psychological treatment
7369272 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
7369273 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
7369274 as most of the cases take place in remote villages where there is poverty and illiteracy we need to launch a campaign to make people aware of the social and moral implications of such marriages
7369275 the mother should not hesitate to inform the police if the father insists on marrying his child to an old man
7369276 fathers like these consider their daughters to be slaves selling them to the highest bidder
7369277 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
7369278 if i do win it will certainly signal a new direction a new era for the liberal democrats
7369279 thats where i believe we have to be as a party in the future
7369280 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your advertisement house
7369281 their projected rates of expansion are so fast we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
7369282 you have to consider the environmental impact in a broader context
7369283 there is significant economic benefit from the development of oilsands the oilsands represent a very secure reliable long term source of supply
7369284 they say no no were going to do research and really clean up our act you cant give these guys permission to go ahead on the promise that something is going to happen in the future
7369285 it would be the equivalent of several hundred exxon valdez oil spills
7369286 it took off and reported a technical problem and tried to return to the airport
7369287 the united states is our great friend they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7369288 it is deeply regrettable that any party should be trying to make political capital in these circumstances out of what are routine ministerial visits
7369289 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7369290 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7369291 he lists five women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day
7369292 he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on television well excuse me but jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight look at the today programme have i got news for you newsnight
7369293 it seems to me that tv is a fantastic place for middle class white males
7369294 they are very much judged to be the people imbued with a sort of gravitas that women are still struggling to achieve
7369295 the day that they find a direct causal link between bleach and brain power i will admit you can link blonde women together its not just blondes brunettes that present news for gods sake were not cattle
7369296 please help me the british people tell mr blair to take the troops out of iraq and not bring them here to baghdad
7369297 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi al qaeda in iraq network
7369298 we are working to get it at a much better standard across the board but overwhelmingly its been positive
7369299 im getting good reports about people being able to go back to villages and home countries and provide a better home for their children
7369300 those calls have been coming in and at this point we have some teams coming in that will be doing a more detailed assessment where they will be going into these homes and looking at what type of damage theyve had
7369301 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7369302 this is the rainy season for florida so must likely they are going to see rain
7369303 the water had no where to go it went into the rivers and now its going to take a lot of time for that water to run through the system
7369304 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster
7369305 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7369306 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7369307 the event went pretty well we got a lot of rain had some trees and stuff down but everything was handled in a good time frame and no injuries which we are very proud of
7369308 keep in mind the rains that were toward the north of us and the system that was moving to the north of us all of this water has to come down at some point so hopefully our drain system and the ground will disperse that water before the upstream waters get here
7369309 se tiene que buscar punto de equilibrio entre el estado y las comunidades nativas

7369319 we have been reshaping the cryptek organization to take full advantage of new business opportunities and are very pleased to add an experienced industry executive of garys caliber
7369320 gary brings exactly the right blend of balanced experience dynamic leadership and personal drive to guide the critical operations of the company as we move forward on our strategic growth path
7369321 i think even more so now is when people should take a critical look at is this person going to end up hurting my firm more than helping it
7369322 we all must come to the realization that there is such a thing as bad work
7369323 i would rather sit out and read a book than work and im not getting paid
7369324 if youre losing per unit you dont make it up in volume
7369325 each firm has its own definition of what is the cream and what is the milk and i think people will cull out the more anemic stuff but its very easy to carve yourself out of a lucrative market if youre not too careful
7369326 its just we cant afford to work for your category of client anymore
7369327 you come out of law school with a very altruistic approach to how youre going to practice law and at some point you realize that you cant be all things to all people
7369328 it looks like you just threw them in a box
7369329 if you wake up at 3 oclock in the morning sweating because you know you have a meeting with mr and ms problem client is it really worth it
7369330 if youre talking to the client a lot that you dont think is necessary sort of hand holding it gets to be very expensive for the client and thats not a good thing for you as the attorney
7369331 either theyre paying more than they should or youre undercutting what you should be getting someones not going to be happy
7369332 you have to do it face to face and you have to be prepared to write off whatever your bill is at that point

7369349 we have said it from the start that the opposition pact is fragile and its only aim is to topple barisan nasional
7369350 it is just an electoral pact and not a solid union which could serve as an alternative to bn
7369351 malaysia is a country which upholds its constitution so whatever policy is drawn up must be in line with the constitution
7369352 the federal constitution has stipulated islam as the countrys official religion while the other races are free to practise their own religions
7369353 his stand today is different from that when he was in umno
7369354 now he is so obsessed with becoming the prime minister that he is prepared to conspire with dap even if it could have a negative impact on the countrys politics
7369355 i hope the authorities especially the police are prepared to face this kind of situation which could heighten tensions if not stopped
7369356 the campaign period until tomorrow is a critical time for the bn machinery which needs to work hard until the last moment despite the attempts at disruption
7369357 he anwar claimed that the swearing on the quran by mohd saiful azlan bukhari was wrong then he should show the people and his supporters how the swearing should be performed if he is not afraid of the truth
7369358 indians played a major role in the last general election hindraf played a major role but these heroes of hindraf were not recognised they should be honoured
7369359 we dont expect victory but 15 per cent of the votes is like total rejection we must send a strong signal to the party that it has to be racially representative
7369360 in fact hindraf came about with the controversy in late 2005 over mount everest climber m moorthys conversion to islam when it first happened who was the first to take up the case
7369361 it was dap lawyers not p uthayakumar another detained hindraf leader and gang
7369362 the secretary general of the party has repeatedly urged the release of the hindraf detainees under the internal security act it is just that the party polls are highly competitive thats all
7369363 with the two hindraf cec candidates in detention of course it was impossible for them to go to the branches and canvass for votes at the end of the day popularity matters
7369364 people would not sit with me or talk to me but they would talk about me
7369365 there were times when i thought why dont i just die
7369366 if they my co workers did not come to me to talk i would go up to them and initiate conversation
7369367 in the last 12 years there have been many new drugs that are better cheaper and less toxic resulting in less side effects
7369368 the new medication stops the hiv aids virus from multiplying
7369369 with the medication a persons immune system will return to normal levels and he does not succumb to infections that people with a weakened immune system are at risk of
7369370 i couldnt walk i was so weak i had to be spoon fed my family who took care of me gave up hope they were waiting for me to die
7369371 i wanted be honest with my friends i wanted them to hear about my condition from me and not a different source
7369372 it has happened so frequently that i am almost immune to it now i think its their choice you can only tell people so much about hiv aids but at the end of the day you cannot force them not to discriminate
7369373 if it was just me alone it would be different i live with my mother and wife i dont want the neighbours to know about it and start discriminating against them because of me
7369374 i was taught to think positive the centre taught me how to live again
7369375 go out and do all the bad things since you are going to die anyway
7369376 not in this hospital sungai buloh but the patients who are referred here from elsewhere tell me about their experiences
7369377 the nursing staff were rude to him and other hiv aids patients sometimes they did not even want to change his iv fluid packet and i had to do it
7369378 i can tell you so many stories of discrimination they the nurses did not hide the fact that they would wear two pairs of gloves when they needed to give him her husband an injection
7369379 they never cleaned him properly or even the ward they werent bothered at all
7369380 sometimes i had to refer my hiv positive patients to one of them and i would get a aiya no need to refer to me lah give the case to someone else
7369381 if you as a doctor or nurse are going to discriminate against hiv aids patients how do you expect regular people not to discriminate
7369382 some have been refused surgery on the basis of their status
7369383 the fraudsters know that men are usually weak when it comes to women
7369384 at times these sexual acts are recorded and it may be used as a form of extorting the victims later if necessary
7369385 these factors show that it is human nature to desire maximum pleasure with minimum pain
7369386 i am here to help the positive community and empower them and tell them they are not alone
7369387 we are human beings we hold jobs and we are productive
7369388 hiv aids is not about people who go to prostitutes or drug addicts its also about housewives and children it is in households
7369389 people say im a victim because i contracted it from my husband but to a prostitute they say oh she deserves it
7369390 when i told them of my condition they were fully supportive and are there for me
7369391 twenty thousand people doctors scientists volunteers ngos and media representatives were there to discuss one topic hiv aids it opened up my mind
7369392 it is an advocacy group to fight for the rights of those living with hiv aids in the country and to give them hope
7369393 it has taken a long time for them to come forward and make their status known to the public for many of them it is not just the fear that they may be ostracised or lose their jobs but also that members of their families may suffer the same fate
7369394 the network aims to let people realise that they do not have to live with their disease alone and that there is a lot of support for them
7369395 we will need all their support we will form links with other agencies ngos and networks overseas
7369396 the stigma and discrimination result in those who may even know that they are hiv positive to not disclose their status to others and by doing that put their partners at risk
7369397 because of stigma and discrimination prevention programmes cannot be carried out on a scale large enough to make them effective
7369398 people are afraid to even get tested and if positive to get treatment
7369399 we encourage them to at least tell their family just in case they the hiv positive persons fall sick and the family knows what to do
7369400 it is a tremendous decision for me i personally believe there is no future in a race based political system we want the people to feel they have stakes in this land
7369401 i feel strongly for what the dap stands for and not because it is an opposition party dap is a consistent party that has remained steadfast in its beliefs
7369402 it is highly inappropriate for certain quarters to say that all this was a set up or a political ploy
7369403 the investigation papers were opened after aca received reports from the public on alleged graft by the duo and this occurred several months ago
7369404 tsushima is an island at the mercy of relations between the two countries
7369405 we have a history of exchanges for 2 000 years
7369406 weve gone through hardships from time to time but unless we get rid of the island we cant help but live together
7369407 whenever japan attempted to make dokdo a subject of international dispute weve reacted meekly we need to react strongly this time
7369408 but the number of korean visitors has been slightly declining since last month im afraid its because of takeshima
7369409 south korea is close to us in one sense but far from us in the other sense
7369410 historically tsushima has played a role of mediator even at great risk to itself
7369411 i think we should differentiate the relationship between two countries and the relationship between individuals
7369412 i think the koreans and the japanese should get along well because we are neighbours
7369413 parents are so worried about their unmarried offspring that they feel they have to do something
7369414 our son doesnt know were here but we hope hell be pleased
7369415 in our blessed and mostly peaceful society were not as familiar with courage as we once were we ascribe the virtue to all manner of endeavors that only really require skill fortitude and a little daring the qualities pat tillman showed on the football field pats best service to his country was to remind us all what courage really looks like and that the purpose of all good courage is love
7369416 pat tillman understood his obligations no better than his comrades in arms perhaps but better than many of his contemporaries he must have known that such debts are not a burden but that their recompense earns us our happiness so he volunteered to take his place in the ranks and defend his country in a time of peril
7369417 i will remember that his family and his country lost a good man but i will also remember that while many of us may be blessed to live a longer life than he did few of us will ever live a better one and i will celebrate and encourage my children to celebrate the brief brave and happy life of pat tillman a most honorable man
7369418 this applies especially to dap sarawak and other places as well exhaust all avenues of expression before going out and holding press conferences
7369419 we have to be selective they must be genuine in wanting to fight for the party
7369420 they should also be equipped with audible announcement facilities for the blind and clear signage for the deaf
7369421 we want facilities that are accessible not only for us but also for the elderly
7369422 we only want the decision makers to make the right decision that would make our lives easier
7369423 it is only after the second screening that a patient diagnosed with breast cancer would be referred to hospital for treatment
7369424 we will start the pilot project in malacca some time next year
7369425 we chose the state for the pilot run due to its small population and size although breast cancer has long been recognised as the main killer among women awareness of the importance of going for mammograms is still low
7369426 its not easy to win the gold medal weve worked very hard
7369427 its the most glorious day for rhythmic gymnastics in china
7369428 i knew the russian and belarussian teams are at a higher level but we have our style
7369429 we used peking opera music which creates a nice atmosphere for the spectators they understand our background
7369430 i feel this can be part of our growing pain
7369431 we are still a little baby but we are not asking for mercy
7369432 with your blessings we will overcome all the difficulties were going to show what the true taekwondo is down the road
7369433 if this is truly what taekwondo is about then maybe taekwondo shouldnt be in the olympics maybe they should fix it and then let it come back
7369434 there is a feeling that we wont survive the next vote we must present a pristine environment
7369435 the transparency of the refereeing and judging system is like never before
7369436 it was a good strech out for the boys it was not a full game only 15 min quarter but we learnt couple of things which we could fix before the international cup also we would like to thank the box hill north to give us a bit of run before the cup
7369437 it sure hasnt sunk in yet this was such a hard fought battle
7369438 a gold medal in the olympics is a huge victory for us
7369439 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys got a good taste of whats important in life we were crushed by that
7369440 you cant put it in words what he has done here
7369441 his level of achievement is phenomenal and i dont think it will ever be seen again
7369442 this is the best performance since china began competing in the olympics
7369443 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7369444 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7369445 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7369446 to the athletes tonight yesterday you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport
7369447 the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7369448 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad
7369449 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7369450 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7369451 they are well coached theyve got good athletes and they beat us
7369452 its unlikely that we will see another olympics of this scope and stature again
7369453 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
7369454 the stadium will be a very different concept to beijing
7369455 were talking about leaving a 25 000 seater all purpose stadium
7369456 the largest urban park created in europe for more than 150 years
7369457 a huge amount of our investment in the olympic park is for legacy we are cleaning up the land burying overhead power lines upgrading roads and railways and installing new energy infrastructure
7369458 a site of this scale and quality within a few minutes of a great city centre must be almost unprecedented
7369459 any time you play united is always special they are a special team
7369460 we have a good record against them and i have not lost to them at home in two spells as manager
7369461 we will not be taking anything for granted because they have players like wayne rooney and carlos tevez who on their day are among the best in the world
7369462 we played them in the community shield and chelsea last weekend and in all honesty there is not much to choose between the two teams they will be the sides to beat again
7369463 a couple of years ago i did think about coming out of retirement
7369464 i spoke to steve mcclaren a couple of times about it when he became the new coach and considered it quite strongly for a while
7369465 when steve was appointed he rang and asked me to return just the fact the england manager had rung and asked me to come back and play for my country meant a lot to me
7369466 in the end i came to the conclusion i had made the right decision in the first place and did not want to go back
7369467 i will carry on as long as i can as long as i feel i am still contributing to united i want to carry on if i feel i can still be of worth i will carry on if not i will go
7369468 i am sure the manager will say something as well if he turns round to me and says i am not doing enough any more then fair enough that will be it
7369469 fabio is meant to lead but the only place weve gone so far is round in circles
7369470 it is time for the real capello to stand up and start dictating to the players and the public exactly what he wants then hell find people will get behind him
7369471 it means picking vibrant wide players rather than starting with david beckham when he cant get forward as he used to it means banging steven gerrard and frank lampards heads together and getting them to play as a unit because they can
7369472 the weeks of dithering about who should be england captain summed it up for me im sure the intention was to give everyone a fair chance but it made him look weak and indecisive
7369473 im so glad and happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7369474 it was not a nice weekend but it is not the first time
7369475 we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7369476 my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised
7369477 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for all the supporters who came here this weekend to support me
7369478 weve had quite a strong weekend nice new circuit got some good points heikki kovalainen and the team got some good points it was just overall a solid weekend for us
7369479 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7369480 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7369481 it was agreed pakistan would retain the right to host the event next year but that if at a certain time any members still had reservations then the iccs board would have the right to relocate the event
7369482 that he carried a letter from macarthur thanking him for fighting communists in japan during the immediate postwar era but the other part was true as well i had police records and other documents that demonstrated that we were all going to have a meeting machii his son his mother his secretary to discuss the matter if my safety could be guaranteed but in the middle of negotiations about how and when and where to meet his wife became ill that delayed things then machii died so that was the end of that
7369483 the rumor that yakuza money still sleeps inside tsk will keep everyone away
7369484 they know that the price will mysteriously rise once the negotiations start
7369485 when people come here they usually know what they want perfume isnt like bags people dont have a lot of different perfume when they like it they will stick to it
7369486 new customers may not understand creed at first but we try to educate them people dont go crazy the first time they try our perfume but we give them time to try and 70 per cent return because the scent just got better
7369487 like food for the body natural ingredients are the best to be used in fragrances we devote our budget not to advertising but to source the best ingredients
7369488 we try to be the best in what we do if we are food wed like to be gourmet thats why we dont want too many customers my father olivier doesnt care about turnovers we are not focused on marketing we just make perfume and try to do it differently
7369489 what makes me sad is that some people think perfume is an easy way to make money of course if you use synthetic ingredients make 100 000 bottles in cheap glass and sell them everywhere you can
7369490 but that gives the wrong impression to customers they think creed is cheating them by making big money when we put all our money in the expensive ingredients compare a little car and a ferrari both are cars but inside theres a whole world of difference
7369491 the description is often more a marketing tool than anything else some people say creeds fragrances are not powerful enough that is where we are different fragrances with synthetic ingredients depend on top notes with natural ingredients the back notes are important
7369492 creeds fragrances build gradually its not powerful in the beginning but it gets better whats the point of having a fragrance that is strong for the first 10 minutes and then fades
7369493 there are many fragrances which i like and many which i dont but i try everything like thierry muglers angel not because i like it but because i want to know why its such a hit but generally i think perfumes should be round it mustnt have a peak that hurts the nose it should be a round bouquet
7369494 love in white is light soft and romantic i imagine it for a wedding or for a soft gentle woman love in black is stronger with more aggressive notes some women like mens fragrance and this is another choice it uses violet leaves and flowers something creed uses in its mens fragrances its the perfume for the working women
7369495 a gente se acovardou demais jogou sem vontade pelo menos o resultado deu moral
7369496 through fff 2008 we provide a platform for malaysians to push the boundaries of our democratic space and openly express and discuss their opinions
7369497 two months ago three other wi members and i participated in a mardi course to learn how to increase our kuih production and improve packaging techniques my packaging is still modest but i want to make my products more marketable by improving them
7369498 occasionally our members are sent to wis headquarters to learn new skills such as embroidery or handicraft making when they come back they teach these skills to women in villages here
7369499 i was 20 when i accompanied the previous raja perempuan of perlis to meet women in the villages i would carry my periuk cooking pot into the kampung to do cooking demonstrations and teach them about nutrition
7369500 it is such an honour to be picked when i consider i was competing among women who were such high achievers i didnt think i stood a chance
7369501 i didnt even know about the nomination i was flattered and honoured because its not that often your boss thinks highly of you
7369502 judging this contest was a humbling experience for me these women are a dynamic mix of brains compassion energy and glamour it reflects how far theyve come and how far they can go
7369503 the bank has given me a new position as the ceo of standard chartered bank in london
7369504 im disappointed they are not doing well on long oil we cannot win like this its sad to concede defeat as they have another three games to go tomorrow today
7369505 all of my charges failed to post a 200 pin average today yesterday other nations also did not have a good outing but they adapted fast i dont know maybe something is wrong with the oiling machine
7369506 however we cant do anything about it i need to re modify the bowlers balls for long oil to improve its reaction
7369507 the bowlers however have been reminded to try their best tomorrow today in the trios second block they will need to make the necessary adjustments before going for the broke in the team event
7369508 our challenge in the afc cup will be tougher without the foreigners but we will try our best
7369509 our target was to qualify for the quarter finals and we have achieve that anything else will be a bonus
7369510 what we have achieved is something great and its only possible if the formula is right support of the management is also important and players salaries must be paid on time
7369511 there must be clear job descriptions for everyone involved with the team
7369512 we are playing catch up now because we have lost this game but we have to cope and bounce back in the next game on wednesday
7369513 we need a top class performance then because today saturday was simply not good enough
7369514 its a disappointment fulham started stronger than us and they were sharper especially in the first half they didnt create many chances if you look at the whole game but they took advantage from a corner
7369515 we tried to come back but we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes we didnt keep calm in and around the box
7369516 we lacked a bit more quality in our passing than normal and if you look at how much possession we had that shows that technical quality is important as well
7369517 fulham have a good midfield and we werent at our best today the passing was not as good as it could be either and that applied to every area
7369518 we couldnt afford a mistake in a game like this if we had gone to half time 0 0 i believe we would have won the game
7369519 india cannot afford to be left behind in addressing climate change both in reducing emissions and in evolving resilience
7369520 we as the future generations of india want to see india as an environmental leader and not a laggard
7369521 you sense a tougher environment a more restricted environment a more pessimistic environment its a moment of turmoil i think
7369522 the government seems confused about how to deal with the difficulties and they have been making some mistakes in running the economy
7369523 nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it
7369524 was of the belief that these sexual interactions would be a positive experience for her daughter and that richards would receive sexual gratification
7369525 what why would i want this i dont have smelly feet
7369526 i started in the industry at the age of 13 due to my drive for music i knew what i wanted to do even then
7369527 i met madonna at the hospital i was hospitalised and both mark kamins new york club deejay and madonna visited me they were enthusiastic and passionate about putting their music out there
7369528 madonna was one of the hardest working people in the industry at that time and she still is
7369529 live music is expensive these days but buying a ticket to madonnas concert is worth every penny she is a great performer
7369530 the ramones literally were my extended family they came in and out of my house just like theirs we were close
7369531 after hearing rave reviews about their performance at cbgb a club in new york i immediately signed the band to my label my wife linda even managed them that was how close we were
7369532 the deaths of johnny dee dee and joey were a great loss dee dee had his battle with drugs and joey fell sick for awhile but i would never guess that johnny would die soon after he was one of those men who should have lived for years and years
7369533 the ramones introduced me to talking heads i was blown away the first time i heard them playing they proved that song composition is essential to break into the music scene
7369534 there are a lot of unsigned talents out there amazing talents i love glas vegas and megan smith is incredible i am not sure if you guys have heard about them on this side of the world
7369535 they almost have the same vibes and enthusiasm for work i love that attitude in an artiste
7369536 we have not been doing well in the past 10 years sales are a concern among music labels they have dropped drastically
7369537 the internet has been contributing to such a phenomenon and we are worried of the outcome the new generation has grown accustomed to free downloading
7369538 this will only make the coming generations refuse to pay for music
7369539 the new media do have their highs it helps a lot of singers to put their music out there the role of internet should be used more for its positive side rather than the negative
7369540 a great song can come from any part of the world and not necessarily from the united states or the united kingdom this region is showing signs of progress when it comes to music
7369541 even when you engage in fusion your roots have to be grounded classical music is my forte
7369542 i first collaborated with samuel a decade ago when he composed music for my shows its great to collaborate once again for a good cause
7369543 in the early days when we used to make our way to the villages or estates there were hardly any proper roads when we couldnt travel by bus we cycled and when we couldnt cycle we walked
7369544 the majority of our members may refer to themselves as housewives yet they are women with the ability to earn their own income thats the magic wi has worked
7369545 and when women have money that money goes to the whole family which is why we take the goal of making women including rural women financially independent very seriously
7369546 the means for women to improve their lives and be their own bosses is there but they have to come forward and capitalise on these opportunities
7369547 il ny a que les imb ciles qui ne changent pas davis

7369549 no withdrawal has been mentioned today the russians are keeping all their previous illegal checkpoints
7369550 wording a job description without any informaiton is what they do best
7369551 most people dont realize that what they truly want in a partner contradicts who they are themselves at the core they are one thing and desire another
7369552 the beginning of successful online dating starts with a profile that is unique because it projects the strength of who you are because it shows your most authentic self and because you are honestly communicating who you are really looking for in a partner
7369553 i look at dozens if not hundreds of photos a day and i am amazed at the choices people make when they upload their photos to the internet they dont realize that their main photo is leaving a first impression
7369554 we have already introduced the scheme in the uae and jordan the kingdom which has the largest concentration of sri lankan housemaids in the region will be the third country to launch the program
7369555 such an arrangement will ease problems affecting employees employers and the two governments in case of the eventuality of circumstances such as the repatriation of bodies disabilities emergency medical expenses and legal assistance
7369556 the insurance cover would also include return air tickets if a sponsor failed to meet a workers costs of return travel
7369557 the system is aimed at safeguarding the interests of employers who incur financial losses when their maids do not fulfill contractual obligations or run away
7369558 we lived in the late sixties and early seventies my dad was with an oil services company so it seemed natural that i would come back to the middle east after i finished school
7369559 the intention is to teach you a language and then put you into any area where the language is spoken
7369560 they didnt know that i had a grounding in arabic and i had wanted to learn mandarin as my mother was born and brought up in china and is fluent in it
7369561 from then on anytime something came up in the middle east they would say youre going or who wants to go and i would say i do
7369562 they started doing funny things that none of us understood
7369563 a couple of councils started up and crashed and burned mainly in the free zones
7369564 im not bad mouthing anybody so dont misunderstand me but for a variety of reasons they just did not work out
7369565 i am the american face of the luxury marketing association which is american
7369566 i am not a marketer its not my thing she brings those skills that i didnt have
7369567 it is a by invitation only to join professional association of brand managers and brand marketing managers of brands that market products and services to hnwis its specialty marketing for the luxury sector we help those brands that are members have the opportunity to get together with people who are like minded who have the same jobs basically within the luxury sector but not necessarily competitors how do those brands learn how to work together better in order to get more the people with more money thats what its all about
7369568 every property developer here says they are luxury a brand every hotel says theyre luxury even though they could be two star and they say theyre luxury its to cull out the true luxury from the wannabes
7369569 we want to see what you have done in a marketing role that benefits the membership nothing proprietary no competitive intelligence
7369570 american express which hosted the inaugural event in june for example did this research into which geographical are their members spent more than others that knowledge has value for the membership
7369571 you can throw a bunch of seeds out or you can plant them carefully and help them bloom we help them bloom forcefully
7369572 i expect to have 10 chapters in my region 200 brands as chapters so i expect to have 2000 members by 2010
7369573 whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7369574 this working class kid from scranton and wilmington has always been a friend to the underdog and all who seek a safer and more prosperous america to live their dreams and raise their families
7369575 i was feeling like if i shot 10 under today i could win the golf tournament
7369576 if i get to 13 under that is tough at the end of the day
7369577 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
7369578 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
7369579 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007
7369580 says the belgium of his wealthy eco tourists congos paths have definitely become unbeaten
7369581 youre free but your shadow is chaos and it will always be there by your side
7369582 reflected my flat mate when we discussed the movie anarchy and freedom still cohabitate in congo definitely
7369583 its the sound of the police you hou its the sound that i miss you hou

7369594 the senate action now sets the stage for the final passage of what will be one of the most important laws enacted by this congress
7369595 the d c circuits reversal stands reality on its head
7369596 the d c circuits decision in the murphy case is the first time that any court has construed the tax code to imply an excise tax on the privilege of utilizing the legal system to vindicate a federal statutory right
7369597 however congress did not pass a special tax demanding payment from people who use the legal system to prevent retaliation against or to vindicate civil rights it was error for the d c circuit to imply such a tax
7369598 in 1997 the was formed with the motto stop it fix it and find out who was harmed
7369599 the fbi and justice department have strongly resisted efforts by the to determine the names of those defendants who were treated unfairly as a result of bad forensic science
7369600 this has severely prejudiced people who have been hurt by the fbi labs misconduct
7369601 without this reporting by the washington post and 60 minutes the fbi and justice department would continue to delay release of the bullet lead case files and notification of defendants and the courts about these problems
7369602 the last thing the justice department should do is what has been done to aggressively stop parties from discovery of those citizens harmed
7369603 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
7369604 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
7369605 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
7369606 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
7369607 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
7369608 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
7369609 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
7369610 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
7369611 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
7369612 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed

7369614 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
7369615 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
7369616 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
7369617 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
7369618 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
