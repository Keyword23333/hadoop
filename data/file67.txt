670000 these unique performances herald a series of special musical events throughout the year to mark the universitys centenary im delighted to be working alongside andrew lawrence king and the rest of the team to bring cutting edge baroque performance to the heart of our city in the cathedral
670001 our research indicates that 21st century hostel staff have a greater need then ever before to be trained to support homeless people with drug alcohol mental health and other social problems
670002 since 1990 a great deal of investment has ensured that old fashioned dormitory hostels are a thing of the past new modern hostel facilities and multi function day centres provide a desperately needed safety net for homeless and vulnerably housed people across our cities further investment is needed however to equip hostel staff with the necessary skills to support some of societys most vulnerable people
670003 there are several reasons why experts believed that language was necessary for other intellectual functions the theory was that in order to process these concepts the brain has turned them into language in order to interpret them so for example the number 2 would need to be turned into the word two for the brain to understand it
670004 mathematics and language were thought to be particularly closely linked because maths has a grammar to it that is similar to that used in language
670005 the research demonstrates that in adult brains the language and mathematical functions are separate however it may be the case that in childhood we need language in order to build these separate systems
670006 there are around 40 million people in the world living with hiv aids and while those in the west find it relatively easy to treat and keep their symptoms largely under control the real epidemic is happening in the developing world the events enabled us to draw attention to these facts and to encourage openness about hiv and aids
670007 the events at the university of sheffield were mirrored across the city and south yorkshire the university s arts tower was covered in a giant red ribbon and schools colleges hospitals and churches united to mark world aids day the response from the students was fantastic we managed to raise a significant amount of money and are delighted to be able to give that back to hiv aids support groups in the community
670008 this research grant will allow my team in sheffield together with teams at glasgow nottingham and manchester universities to pioneer faster smaller and more efficient methods of manipulating and building molecular structures
670009 the development of snomipede technology represents the coming together of nanotechnology molecular and cell biology microsystems engineering and synthetic and surface chemistry
670010 the implications of the snomipede will also be far reaching in the world of medical research the new technology can potentially be used in the fields of tissue engineering and protein research these applications will enable researchers to develop a better understanding of disease human tissue and human genes
670011 in america the evercare programme was originally delivered in nursing homes and included extra nursing care to look after patients when they fell ill thus reducing the need for hospital admissions in the uk this is not the case
670012 the evercare programme ensures that valuable care reaches some of the most vulnerable members of society but it seems unlikely that it will lead to a vast reduction in emergency admissions
670013 as part of our centenary year a number of staff alumni and students from the university will be taking part in a tall ship challenge in march after arranging the challenge we felt that this was something which would benefit students from local schools and colleges the students will experience all aspects of an onboard lifestyle including an opportunity to climb to the top of the tallest mast
670014 although national student volunteering week is a great opportunity for students to help out in the local community it is important to remember that student volunteers from the university of sheffield spend around 700 hours per week supporting local organisations and charities throughout the year
670015 our current student volunteers show a high level of commitment and enthusiasm and we are delighted to have seen an increase in the number of students interested in volunteering it s exciting proof that more young people are making an active contribution to their local community

670017 the university is delighted to welcome sir mike as one of the guest speakers during our centenary year
670018 we are honoured to celebrate 100 years of teaching and research with such high profile guest lectures and hope to continue our success in the future
670019 given the apparent resurgence of war as an instrument of great power politics the views of britains leading soldier will be of profound interest to all concerned with the conduct of global politics
670020 these three concerts will give the audience the opportunity to hear first hand the experimental combination of technology with music which helped to kick start the electronic music scene in the uk
670021 for existing fans of the electroacoustic sound sound junction iii is a fantastic opportunity to see some of the genre s most exciting exponents in action

670023 this is the second time we have run the project which was written alongside the national curriculum this means that the pupils can use what they have learnt back in the classroom we were able to relate microbiology to real life situations opening science up to everyone
670024 this project has been a fantastic opportunity for the students they have gained valuable experience in both science and higher education to be invited to the royal society s exhibition is great recognition of all the work that the students have put in we have thoroughly enjoyed working with the university and hope to continue our partnership in the future
670025 the poem fought its way through many drafts and many trips back to the museum
670026 our vision is to develop graduates who gain a wide range of transferable capabilities applicable to their future employment and to lifelong learning our graduates will be passionate about their subject and the experience of learning and will be able to transfer these skills into the workplace
670027 this cetl will enable us to develop specific enterprise zones in all three universities which will act as a focal point for students and staff interested in starting their own business or selling a business idea
670028 our work to encourage enterprise has already yielded success and this funding will allow us to further develop the programme over the next five years
670029 these are prestigious awards and our success demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our students have the best possible experience at university and leave here with the knowledge and skills to succeed in whatever they choose for the future
670030 engaging children at a young age is a key part of encouraging them to consider higher education and careers in skilled professions in the future we hope that the young people of arbourthorne have fun learning some of the skills used in healthcare jobs and hopefully this experience will inspire them to become the doctors and nurses of the future
670031 i m delighted to be able to go out into the community with other students and talk to young people about careers in healthcare it s great to be able to play a part in encouraging young people s ambitions
670032 parkinson s disease is a brain disorder that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die or become impaired these cells produce dopamine and a lack of dopamine is a characteristic of the condition dopamine is responsible for allowing smooth coordinated function of the body s muscle and movement and parkinson s sufferers will usually suffer tremors stiffness difficulty with balance and slowness of movement
670033 we will be using the tropical zebrafish in our research as they are genetically very similar to humans
670034 previous studies have shown that some toxins when given in high enough doses cause parkinson s symptoms
670035 once we understand how the different factors causing parkinson s work together we can get closer to influencing the underlying disease processes at its source rather than just treating the symptoms as a clinician i see and treat many patients with parkinson s and to be given a grant that may allow me to develop new ways of treating the condition is extremely exciting
670036 this project is a good example of how we can use the zebrafish as a model system to uncover the genetic and cellular defects that lie at the heart of many debilitating human diseases the interdisciplinary team in the centre for developmental and biomedical genetics is using similar approaches to examine root causes and early interventions for a number of conditions including muscular dystrophy and various neurodegenerative disorders
670037 the consortium is an exemplar of successful university collaboration in the uk it adds value to its members and has a role in helping to inform and deliver the regional economic strategy i m delighted to have the opportunity to drive its future it s in great shape already with a talented and dedicated team and continuing commitment and support from the vice chancellors at the universities of leeds sheffield and york i m looking forward to building on its strengths and anticipate even greater achievements in the future
670038 this is an important strategic role for all three universities requiring vision a clear sense of direction and strong leadership julian has these qualities in abundance and we are delighted that he has accepted this position
670039 the white rose consortium has been an extremely successful and innovative organisation in its 8 year history it has proved to be an invaluable asset to all three universities and i look forward to working with julian to take it forward to further success future
670040 its a philosophical exercise in what identity is and why we should care about that
670041 south asia cannot progress unless there is stability and security throughout the region it is in recognition of this reality that we have ensured the signature at this summit of the convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters we have condemned all forms of terrorist violence and emphasized that our states should firmly cooperate especially through the exchange of information against terrorism and organized crime

670043 we will be relating microbiology to real life situations and using laboratory experiments to bring the subject to life one of the more topical issues we will be talking about is superbugs such as mrsa and how they become resistant to antibiotics
670044 our aim is to raise the achievement of our students by giving them opportunity to learn about microbiology in one of the uk s leading research centres previous visits have had a lasting impact on the students with many of them seriously considering the opportunities that higher education offers i believe this work backs up our strong commitment to science teaching at chaucer
670045 i am delighted to support this initiative and to use our facilities apart of this programme to encourage students to learn about these fascinating areas of biological research
670046 this is an exciting project that will give the pupils chance to work alongside professional scientists i hope more this experience will inspire more schoolchildren to pursue a career in science and engineering
670047 to prevent this social insects have developed several methods of worker policing the most common of which is when eggs laid by non queens are detected and killed by other workers this method has been observed in more than 15 species of bee ant and wasp
670048 workers also police their societies by preventing crimes from being committed in the first place
670049 this paper shows that policing is a common feature of all social life not just humans it helps to resolve the conflicts thrown up when the needs of the individual and society differ
670050 the proposed fund raising that we have announced today is designed to provide us with the investment capital needed to commercialise successfully some of the world class ip being generated at the university of sheffield biofusions experienced management team is already working closely with the university to generate value from its ip in the medical life science sectors and the spin off companies that have already been created we are confident that the capital that we intend to raise in conjunction with our aim listing will enable us to accelerate the value creation from our long term agreement with the university thereby allowing us to generate considerable value for shareholders

670053 multidisciplinary research has crucial advantages firstly it brings multiple perspectives to bear to achieve faster understanding of emerging areas of science and engineering secondly by transferring concepts and skills between disciplines it fosters the sort of creative environment that can breed major breakthroughs and thirdly it allows much more productive communication between the people responsible for academic research and the people responsible for its industrial applications recognising the importance of multi disciplinary research to industrial applications the new campus will also offer facilities to accommodate hi tech businesses
670054 redeveloping this brownfield site is an ideal solution it means we can locate the new campus close to our main campus without incurring any environmental downside and the new facilities will position the university of sheffield right at the leading edge of multidisciplinary research practice worldwide

670056 getting here did not come without controversy as im sure it did with some of the guys sitting behind me
670057 but through it all im here with a greater appreciation for something not every player is able to achieve and for the people who stood up for me and spoke out on my behalf
670058 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him
670059 for four days senator john mccain and his allies have accused senator barack obama of snubbing wounded soldiers by canceling a visit to a military hospital because he could not take reporters with him despite no evidence that the charge is true

670061 no strings relationships have helped cure me of love addiction all my life ive been in long term monogamous relationships i had to break that pattern by not allowing myself to have a relationship for a year stopping myself from committing to men i havent been celibate ive had lots of dates and lots of sex but i havent been pushing to turn a date into a relationship this has been a huge thing for me

670065 we have also received information that suggests that the other driver may have been traveling upwards of 50 mph and that said driver may not have been looking forward at the time of the accident
670066 we have strong evidence that the other driver ran a red light the case is still under investigation

670070 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
670071 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
670072 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
670073 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
670074 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it

670088 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 so this is remarkable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
670089 we could have managed to do the race a little better and i was stuck behind alonso all the way to the second stop
670090 im a little bit lucky with other people going all over the place
670091 we have the speed in the race but if i cant get qualifying right then we will always end up like this
670092 weve had killings before but not like this not visitors
670093 dont feel no ill but i cant help you with this one
670094 its really rough right now what i think the government should do is search every house find every gun and if youre not working in the hotel business it should be the rule that you dont go there
670095 unless we really do something about all this i dont know if we can consider ourselves a safe place
670096 sending young people to prison means theyre recruited into hardened criminal gangs when they come out theyre not able to get a job and they become foot soldiers in the drugs trade
670097 crime is very high in antigua its those who get sent back after serving their time whoever deports them should have to look after them
670098 they dont always get involved in criminality some of them manage to get their lives back on track
670099 i was brought down here to build a police force
670100 if people have a problem they wait til carnival time and then they deal with it

670129 you know what john why dont you watch this very informative video that will answer some of your questions and ill take care of some business
670130 we look at the present through a rear view mirror we march backwards into the future
670131 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
670132 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will
670133 he then asked me to leave my belongings and follow him i recognized we were entering the shin bet israeli internal security service offices at allenby upon entering he motioned for me to sit in a chair within a closed corridor
670134 after what seemed to be one hour and thirty minutes both doors at the end of the corridor opened
670135 they were looking for something specific but i wouldnt know what until green eyes demanded where is the money mohammed
670136 what money i thought of course i had money on me i was traveling for a moment i was relieved thinking this was just a typical shakedown id lose the cash with me but that would be about it
670137 however my traveling money failed to suffice dissatisfied he pressed where is the money from the prize
670138 i realized he was after the award stipend for the martha gellhorn prize from the uk and i told him i did not have it with me id arranged for a bank transfer rather than carry it with me visibly irritated the intelligence agent continued to press for money
670139 the room filled with more intelligence officers bringing the total israeli personnel most well armed in the room to eight eight israelis and me
670140 dissatisfied that larger sums of money failed to materialize green eyes accused me of lying
670141 ok take off your clothes avi the intelligence officer ordered
670142 i asked why a simple pat down would have disclosed any money belts or weapons besides i had already gone through an x ray machine before entering the passport holding area
670143 removing all but my underwear i stood before avi in an increasingly belligerent tone he ordered take off everything
670144 i am not taking off my underwear i stated again he ordered me to remove my underwear
670145 at this point i informed him that an escort from the dutch embassy was currently waiting for me on the other side of the interrogation center and that i was under diplomatic transit
670146 he replied he knew that thus indicating he didnt care and again insisted i strip again i refused there was no reason for me to do so
670147 for a moment i flashed on the scene in the oscar winning film the pianist where the jewish man being humiliated by a nazi quoted shakespeare invoking his faith in place of written words doth a jew not have eyes
670148 avi smirked half chuckling as he informed me this is nothing compared to what you will see now
670149 with that the intelligence officer unholstered his weapon pressing it to my head and with his full body weight pinning me on my side he forcibly removed my underwear completely naked i stood before him as he proceeded to feel me up one side and down the other
670150 avi then proceeded to demand i do a concocted sort of dance ordering me to move to the right and the side
670151 without warning i began to vomit all over the room at the same time i felt my legs buckled from the strain of standing and i passed out i awoke on the floor to someone screaming repeating my name over and over
670152 as he screamed in my ears i felt his fingernails puncturing my skin gouging scraping and clawing at the tender flesh beneath my eyes
670153 realizing i was again conscious though barely the israeli broadened his assault scooping my head and digging his nails in near the auditory nerves between my head and ear drum
670154 i estimate i lay on the floor approximately one hour and twenty minutes and i continued to vomit for what seemed like a half hour
670155 all around me i heard israeli voices and then one placed his combat boot on my neck pressing into the hard floor
670156 in other words if i died or was permanently disabled as a result of israels actions israel could not be held accountable one would think i was in a third world dictatorship rather than the only democracy in the middle east one would think
670157 this is by no means an isolated incident but part of a long term strategy to demolish palestinian social economic and cultural life i am aware of the possibility that mohammed omer might be murdered by israeli snipers or bomb attack in the near future
670158 however omers allegation of being forced to strip naked appeared unusual
670159 while israeli security wont admit it it is a widely accepted secret that palestinians and arabs are routinely subjected to intense hours long questioning that can include strip searches
670160 they made me go to another office and strip naked
670161 this acknowledges receipt of your e mail we have no further comment at this time
670162 to separate rooms in the checkpoint and being forced to remove all clothes to become fully naked
670163 before any visitor gets in however he must go through a stringent security check at the israeli terminal
670164 then a female guard conducted a strip cavity search while two male guards observed
670165 while men have also reported forms of sexual torture in jail women prisoners are particularly vulnerable to this as a form of humiliation by their captors
670166 three israeli soldiers forced a palestinian man to strip naked at gunpoint and walk like a dog in a west bank city under curfew a reuters photographer snapped yasser sharaf 25 standing naked in a cold muddy street in nablus on sunday as two men were handing him clothes to put on and two israeli armoured vehicles were pulling away from the scene
670167 the men were then driven to a nearby yard ordered to strip naked and made to lie face down in the dirt
670168 a soldier inside the jeep ordered me to raise my hands and get out of the car and said take off your shirt
670169 awaiting a court martial on several charges including ordering the boy to strip naked holding a burning paper under his testicles threatening to ram a bottle into his anus and threatening to shoot him
670170 we were mostly older people sick and wounded we had nine handicapped people with us three were from the same family sons of abu ibrahim some of us were too old they were senile when they told them go left they would go right but they stripped them naked anyway i tried to help them as much as i could i was the only one who spoke hebrew close to us was a group of young men they were handcuffed naked and lying on their stomachs the israeli tanks would pass by them so fast only forty centimeters away from their heads
670171 other residents described how young men were stripped naked and then shot
670172 used systematic torture against palestinians and regularly lied about it
670173 humiliation and child abuse at israeli checkpoints strip searching children
670174 weekly report on israeli human rights violations in the occupied palestinian territory
670175 is this going to result in a kind of blessed censorship of a whole host of areas of medical care and research
670176 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
670177 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
670178 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases
670179 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
670180 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in
670181 we want to get the offense going and make everyone comfortable and we want to get the defense established
670182 i think its an effective tool having that ability to get the call in in real time
670183 it alleviates some of the time it takes to get a call but they do turn it off 15 seconds before the play clock expires
670184 im going to miss it no doubt about it said sorenstam who has won 10 majors in her 14 year career including this one in 2003 at royal lytham
670185 to finish with a birdie was special there didnt seem to be any doubt it was going in
670186 but it wasnt as easy as it looked i was a little bit nervous in the second set when she came back
670187 it is not bad for artists to have a little obsession
670188 show that there is a serious struggle of ideas going on for the future of europe
670189 not even monty python could have come up with this
670190 im afraid of getting a judge who doesnt have a sense of humor
670191 they thought i was too offensive too explicit and too strong on sensitive issues like religion

dignorer les appels de ceux qui souffrent aux tats unis les revenus r els des classes moyennes nont pas encore atteint leurs niveaux pr c dant la derni re r cession en 1991 quand george bush a t lu il a d cr t que les r ductions fiscales pour les riches constitueraient un rem de tous les maux de l conomie les b n fices de l conomie dynamis e par ces r ductions fiscales profiteraient tous une

de capital risque qui les financent ne furent pas ceux qui r colt rent le plus de fruits pendant l ge dor de la bulle immobili re ces vrais investissements sont occult s par les jeux qui ont absorb la plupart des acteurs des march s financiers le monde doit repenser les sources de la croissance si les fondations de la croissance conomique reposent dans les avanc es scientifiques et technologiques et pas dans la sp culation sur les march s immobiliers ou financiers alors le syst me fiscal doit tre r align pourquoi les sp culateurs qui tirent leurs revenus des casinos de wall street seraient ils moins tax s que ceux qui gagnent leur vie autrement les gains des capitaux devaient tre tax s au moins autant que les revenus ordinaires ces op rations obtiendraient dans tous les cas un b n fice

songer en mettre en place deux facteurs ont d clench la crise actuelle dune part la guerre en irak a contribu laugmentation des prix du p trole notamment par laggravation de linstabilit au moyen

670276 it might be good for the guys bring us back down to earth and make us work harder although the work ethic within the group has been great and we prepared well for the game
670277 it just reinforces how hard it is to win on the road and i think we need that heading to south africa next
670278 we have beaten them already and i guess they are a 15 point better team over there we got shown up by new zealand and that wont happen again
670279 to be honest most barriers in this game are self imposed
670280 it is what you think it is if you think winning away from home is tough then its tough
670281 the great thing is we are in the tri nations and it is wide open
670282 you have just seen a vivid example of how one week is no indicator of the next we will hang on to the things we believe in and of the limited amount of quality ball we got we actually showed some good signs we will look to that in our next opportunity
670283 it was a tough loss you want to win every test so the guys are disappointed to that end
670284 knowing there are still three more games to go we are only halfway through the competition you dont really have time to dwell on any losses
670285 we obviously had the best car for these track conditions
670286 i feel like montreal owes us yeah weve been in position to win and had the best car twice and couldnt close the deal theres always next year
670287 im pretty happy we didnt have a mark on our car we finished fifth we made a mistake and the rules are so new and we thought nascar was going to let us decide when to put dries on so we gambled on it drying out so we put a full dry set up on so we werent set up best for the rain but all in all it was a good day and the car was great i had a blast
670288 yeah its my kind of racing but you really need to be set up right and the tires as old as they are theyre a little hard so was zero grip out there all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning all in all it was a great day except we didnt win
670289 racing in the rain was a lot of fun im glad we didnt wreck im proud of my guys they did a good job having the car ready for the rain i just wished it wouldnt have started raining so hard and we could have raced a little longer i think we maybe would have been a tick better but that was good
670290 i kind of was looking forward to this because ive never raced in the rain but i dont think i will be from now on it was a lot of fun it got a little hairy there when it started raining so hard the car would hydroplane bad down the frontstretch and i mean a 140 or 150 miles an hour hydroplane is not very safe it made it hard to see there at the end it was raining so hard and everything was getting so wet the guys said there was an inch of water in the right side of the car laying on the floorboard in the car so the car started to fill with water and we were going to start having electrical problems well not us but probably everybody soon but it was fun it was a lot of fun im glad i made history today the first time we raced in the rain
670291 it was interesting certainly i dont have road course racing figured out on dry tracks must less wet tracks it was a learning experience i went as hard as i could that i knew 100 percent that i wouldnt run off course and i think that was our saving grace we werent fast by any means but we were pretty smart conservative on the pit stops and everything else we just did the best we could with what we had to work with it was a learning experience nascar did what they had to do to get this race in i credit them for trying we all learned a little bit and the next time we race in the rain it will probably go a lot easier
670292 all you can do is smile because in my opinion it was a pointless race we were running seventh when it was dry we had a great car an easy top 10 then it started raining and we were running in the top 15 then all of a sudden it just down poured and you cant quite literally see in front of you when i was going down the straightaway i had to get next to the wall and the only part that i could see i could barely see the wall i had to look at the wall and follow it down the straightaway it wasnt safe its sad that that happened the scott towels ford fusion was really fast we had an easy top 10 in the dry
670293 it was out of control out there i dont know if the tire was so old or not but it was just way too out of control for what were trying to do we made the right adjustments to where we could at least run competitively i wheel hopped it one time and got off the track which lost us about seven spots and then no one knew what theyre pit road speed needed to be because of the difference in the tires so we got nailed there on pit road exiting we couldnt see anything so we had to stop because we couldnt see out of the windshield just safety reasons then they threw the caution and we lost quite a bit of spots there at the end we were going to have a good day i thought i couldnt see it was a safety thing we had to pit under green and they threw the caution a lap later and it just bit us all in all the clorox fusion is in one piece after this the first time racing in the rain it was interesting
670294 were still only two thirds of the way through earnings season so people will be focused on that
670295 generally investors have felt relieved that the earnings have continued to be better than expected realizing of course that the bar had been set awfully low
670296 they dont want to give the impression that somehow they have lost their concern over inflation that would be fatal
670297 the risks of economic weakness and rising inflation remain relatively balanced
670298 the fed will maintain its accommodative stance for now while refinements to its enhanced liquidity facilities help ease financial strains
670299 they still see downside risks to the economy and the news from financial firms has not been good
670300 i think that they will sit right where they are
670301 i think the decline in oil prices has pulled some of the hawks fangs a bit and they wont be quite as eager as a group to raise interest rates now
670302 they didnt dissent last time why would they dissent now that oil is 20 a barrel cheaper
670303 we have certainly indicated to the raiders that if they terminate him and another club looked to sign him for 2009 we would not register him
670304 we would deregister him for 2009 as that is the only reasonable position in the circumstances
670305 all clubs recognise the inherent unfairness of players being picked up immediately after they have had serious behavioural issues leading to the termination of their contracts
670306 it is difficult to enforce if he goes overseas i dont think we have ever had one before where we have cared
670307 but in his case we would have to consider it
670308 in this case the raiders made it clear they would not wish to see him at another club in 2009
670309 as for 2010 we would need to be convinced that he has made some significant inroads into his problems
670310 kerrin will probably have about four rides for us at kembla
670311 hell then ride trackwork again thursday morning and have another four rides at gosford
670312 ill probably give him friday off but for rosehill next saturday the stable only has a light representation and at this stage we have about two rides for him
670313 kerrins got a big job ahead of him in the next few weeks
670314 hes got to get used to the different tracks the different tempo of our racing and he has to get to know the horses and the form
670315 shes probably got more natural ability than former group one winner regal cheer but now she has to prove that on raceday
670316 so mean i eat glass wash it down with gas
670317 thank you oblivion for taking the initative to post while i was going to post separately on the matter this post is as good as any
670318 thiss ours now ya wanna be in our clan thats fine otherwise well kill ya

670346 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
670347 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
670348 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
670349 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
670350 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

670359 if she werent my sister and she called me every morning i might say leave me alone
670360 if one of them were to call in sick the other says dont worry ill come in today
670361 people are so kind here and the pace of living is so much slower
670362 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
670363 he was crying out for help but none of us got our hands on the right thing soon enough
670364 he loved to give me whatever i wanted when he was doing good but there was a side to him that made me very afraid and i didnt feel safe with him
670365 of course police said they couldnt do anything because he wasnt a danger to himself or others
670366 and the hospitals people have rights you just cant detain them
670367 delusions that people were chasing him and trying to kill him he thought people were going to attack him and his family i think that is why he would always come and go so fast he thought we were in danger because of him
670368 i begged him to stay on his medication and see a doctor
670369 i told him i would pay for it if he would go to a doctor
670370 how can you help someone like that in five days
670371 it would have been ideal if they were able to get him to take his medication to stay in a facility until he was stabilized there are all kinds of things you can do with 20 20 hindsight if a person refuses to take his medications you are going to have a very difficult time
670372 the last week of my brothers life was spent in terror
670373 he said look pop they shot it full of holes
670374 he got his days mixed up out on the mountain
670375 he said they were out there with him on the hill shooting at him
670376 weve told them brian needs help and were afraid of whats going to happen
670377 we were fearful everything was not fine we feel like they didnt do anything to protect us
670378 he kissed me before he left he hugged john i gave him food because he was going back up on the mountain i packed him some sandwiches
670379 he was hard up for money so he sold a bunch he wasnt fit to have them the way he acted
670380 the weapons he possessed do not appear to be recently purchased
670381 he appears to have owned them for quite some time
670382 what about people who live with this disease worrying this could happen to them what about the police officers and how their lives are changed forever were thankful for the police and we thank god no one else was hurt
670383 he was a very good son he was an excellent student he loved the lord with all of his heart he read the bible every day he led a lot of people to the lord i feel he has a lot of trophies built up in heaven it was his illness that made him do as he done i believe my son is in heaven

670653 the only way we can defeat terrorism is if people in this country where terrorists exist learn to respect and love americans

670693 the church of jesus christ of latter day saints has consistently made plain that in matters of public policy it is not opposed to responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages by informed adults
670694 in the downtown redevelopment project currently being planned by the church a limited number of high quality restaurant tenants who will operate on land not owned by the church may apply for licenses to serve alcoholic beverages in accordance with existing state regulations
670695 set an example that we would like to see other stations follow
670696 i dont support the consumption of alcohol i was only doing my job etc etc
670697 christian standards should also apply to those who earn a living by selling or advertising products in the marketplace the magazine womens sports and fitness does not accept cigarette ads thus foregoing much needed revenue
670698 members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints should not be involved in employment or other activities upon which they cannot conscientiously ask the blessings of the lord
670699 what about standing for principle and virtue regardless of the consequences having faith that the lord will bless us for our righteous desires and unwavering commitment to the gospel
670700 and all saints who remember to keep and do these sayings walking in obedience to the commandments shall receive health in their navel and marrow to their bones
670701 if you keep not my commandments the love of the father shall not continue with you therefore you shall walk in darkness
670702 well i do it and my parents and their parents have done it so it cant be that bad
670703 when it is withdrawn amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man
670704 whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants it is the same
670705 i have a good relationship with god and he doesnt mind that i fornicate
670706 refrain from making judgments until we have an adequate knowledge of the facts
670707 most of us have made it clear that we dont judge kirby on a personal level
670708 some us of just think that what he did was selling his integrity and good name for money
670709 general smiths views on the powers and policy of the government of the united states
670710 abolish the practice in the army and navy of trying men by court martial for desertion if a soldier or marine runs away send him his wages with this instruction that his country will never trust him again he forfeited his honor make honor the standard for all men
670711 son do what you think is best you did sign a contract ill support you however i can please dont create a circus around our family by holding a press conference though
670712 the constitution doesnt give them that right so therefore people dont have that right
670713 it must be in the constitution to be a fundamental right
670714 perhaps what i would claim is that we have a right to be free from a mandatory draft or coerced service in the military
670715 necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers
670716 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight
670717 we warn that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals communities and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets
670718 well we dont really know gods will in this regard
670719 god is very mysterious the only thing we can understand about him is that he shares our opinions
670720 science gives questions that cant be answered religion gives answers that cant be questioned
670721 within the next year someone who will be financed by some group will challenge the non recognition of gay marriage in a federal court this challenge will drag on for years eventually ending up in the supreme court resulting in a ruling which based on the poorly written decision in lawrence v texas will more than likely come down on the side of same sex marriage once same sex marriage is declared a fundamental right under the griswold v conn right to privacy logic then and only then will challenges move on to private groups like the church
670722 older voters especially are more reticent about changing the constitution where younger folks are more in favor of allowing same sex marriage
670723 are people who grew up in the 60s and early 70s and they may be a little more tolerant to differences in lifestyles

670727 christian standards should also apply to those who earn a living by selling or advertising products in the marketplace
670728 sister oaks called my attention to a similar example in the world of advertising
670729 i am dismayed that a prominent womens sport tennis continues to take support from a cigarette company
670730 wouldnt it be wonderful if this same attitude of looking after the interests of others governed latter day saints who are making a profit from the sale or promotion of alcoholic beverages
670731 the consumption of alcohol is increasing among youth targeting young audiences advertisers portray beer and wine as joyful socially desirable and harmless producers are promoting new types of alcoholic beverages as competitors in the huge soft drink market grocery and convenience stores and gas stations stock alcoholic beverages side by side with soda pop can christians who are involved in this commerce be indifferent to the physical and moral effects of the alcohol from which they are making their profits
670732 members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints should not be involved in employment or other activities upon which they cannot conscientiously ask the blessings of the lord
670733 people think i endorse beer now which isnt the case i dont advocate anyone drinking
670734 i learned that joseph smith said the ends don t justify the means
670735 god has asked his saints today to refrain from drinking and advertising alcohol
670736 in consequence of evils and designs which do and will exist in the hearts of conspiring men in the last days
670737 god will instruct the prophets to say suv s should not be driven
670738 the priesthood is among us it is real it is powerful it is true the spirit of revelation is among us i want to give you my testimony that the lord will not permit any man to lead his church astray his are the powers of life and death it is his church not the church of any man
670739 do you think america will reach its tri centennial as a nation

670764 as a retired physician i can honestly say that unless you are in a serious accident your best chance of living to a ripe old age is to avoid doctors and hospitals and learn nutrition herbal medicine and other forms of natural medicine unless you are fortunate enough to have a naturopathic physician available almost all drugs are toxic and are designed only to treat symptoms and not to cure anyone vaccines are highly dangerous have never been adequately studied or proven to be effective and have a poor risk reward ratio most surgery is unnecessary and most textbooks of medicine are inaccurate and deceptive almost every disease is said to be idiopathic without known cause or genetic although this is untrue in short our main stream medical system is hopelessly inept and or corrupt the treatment of cancer and degenerative diseases is a national scandal the sooner you learn this the better off you will be

670838 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
670839 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
670840 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
670841 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
670842 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen

670849 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
670850 and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads
670851 here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus
670852 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
670853 if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words
670854 therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
670855 the current notion that christ and his apostles authoritatively substituted the first day for the seventh is absolutely without any authority in the new testament
670856 the scriptures nowhere call the first day of the week the sabbath there is no scriptural authority for so doing nor of course any scriptural obligation
670857 the day is now changed from the seventh to the first day but as we meet with no scriptural direction for the change we may conclude it was done by the authority of the church
670858 by the very act of changing the sabbath into sunday which protestants allow of because by keeping sunday they acknowledge the churchs power to ordain feasts and to command them under sin
670859 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name
670860 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
670861 and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god
670862 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world
670863 but in this homage to the papacy the united states will not be alone the influence of rome in the countries that once acknowledged her dominion is still far from being destroyed and prophecy foretells a restoration of her power i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast the infliction of the deadly wound points to the abolition of the papacy in 1798 after this says the prophet his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast paul states plainly that the man of sin will continue until the second advent to the very close of time he will carry forward his work of deception all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life in both the old and the new world the papacy will receive homage in the honor paid to the sunday institution that rests solely upon the authority of the roman church
670864 and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god
670865 and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle
670866 and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped
670867 the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels

671102 this trade marks the end of a special era in the life of their team they have a different aura now than they had a week ago and the reaction of folks all over their division to mannys unceremonious exit an exit subsidized with 7 million of those hard earned red sox dollars we should note told us all we needed to know it felt like mardi gras for the rest of the al east
671103 everyone knows hes totally nuts and he does the exact same thing every year asking for a trade sitting out a game and not legging out a ground ball then they try to trade him but dont and he gets jolly again and continues being the best righthanded hitter of his generation every single year this happens exactly the same management is supposed to be smarter than him and know that hes just a quirky fellow theyre not supposed to get in a pissing match with the best right handed hitter of his generation just to show that theyre in charge

671111 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
671112 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans
671113 at the moment they are being advised not to say anything because theyre still getting their head around it themselves its all been pretty crazy

671130 obviously education is my first love but i will be more than a one issue candidate im concerned and have experience in the plight of working families providing the best security for our citizens veteran affairs and in general making florida the kind of state we want to live in and one we want to leave for our children
671131 i intend to have a mobile office that will travel around the district and ill spread my staff throughout so we can better meet the needs of our citizens
671132 i think one problem we have in florida is the wide disparity of needs and wants throughout the state
671133 what is good for south florida may not be good for us in north florida district 12 is the same on a smaller scale so i think locally elected officials should decide what is best for their communities

671243 with that being said any fight between lindland and belfort at this time would not be for a wamma title wammas goal is to crown undisputed champions based on our objective rankings based on our rankings we could not sanction a lindland vs belfort fight as a wamma championship however the winner of the match up would certainly cement his place as part of the fighter elite and would be a likely contender for a wamma championship in the future

671247 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
671248 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn 1 and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
671249 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint then at my first pitstop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
671250 obviously it was a very difficult race for us we converted my strategy to a one stopper which was the right thing to do so thanks to the team for that after that though i was running heavy and struggling on the option tyres so had to fight for pace i then made contact with fisichella and lost a position fortunately i was able to regain it when he had to make his final stop that was all we could do today so we need to look into what happened and try to improve for the next race
671251 my first lap wasnt great i was in the wrong place and lost a few positions then during my first pit stop something went wrong with the fuel rig which cost me a couple of decisive seconds and put me behind fisichella my strategy was over then in terms of the heat i didnt have a problem with it weve definitely had worse races this year
671252 esto es un equipo que est bien preparado y tenemos la habilidad para obtener medallas
671253 he was by the corral panel and i decided to sit on his back and he did nothing absolutely nothing not a flinch or anything just sniffed my foot so i am going to finish off his training in the evenings when my son is busy playing with the neighbors boys in their yard since my mom doesnt have a bunch of kids runnng around lately as they stay with their parents or other relatives more now thanks monica we were all concerned about your child care plans and are so happy you chose to include all the details in your horses for sale ad hey pedophiles the kids will be playing in monicas neighbors yard tonight now i am wondering why the bunch of kids would not normally stay with their parents are the parents all meth heads what precisely is the problem here i am hoping once i saddled twister up tomorrow evening that he wont mind me in the saddle since i tried last year to get on in the saddle and he did not like it cause he doesnt like the stirrups banging against his sides unless he is being lunged or lead around dying to know what happened last year do you have video by the way a horse who does not like the stirrups banging against his sides will be the most upset when he is being longed and they are flying free not when he is being ridden and the riders leg foot are stabilizing the stirrup my dad has a friend who could finish his training for me but i would have to get him gelded and i dont want to geld twister especially with how sweet and gentle he is because knocking his nuts off would be so mean gosh he would never forgive you if you did that monica he would think you were punishing him for being so sweet and gentle family bred and raised by me had him every since he was foaled dam is a registered bay roan appaloosa mare that i trained myself everyone who sees him thinks he is a gelding theyre not smart enough to know what testicles look like either huh my 3 yr old son can play around him and ride on him with someone leading him and tell twister what to do and lead him around mother of the year i have a quiet three year old stallion myself and it would be a cold day in hell when i let a child lead him anywhere you have got to have an iq smaller than your shoe size if you think a toddler should be leading a stallion but hey i know someone who got a call recently from a woman who wanted a stallion that her 5 and 6 year old could go out in the pasture and hug the legs on maybe we can send that buyer to you and then call cps on both of you and save them some gas money doesnt know yet that he is a full stud honey a three year old stallion is like a 14 year old boy he has one thing on his mind he may be good tempered enough not to be screaming at mares and dragging you around but hes not standing there in the corner whacking his willy against his stomach because its hot and needs some air has had a bridle and saddle on him and kids on his back i am endlessly amazed at the number of people who think its a good idea to throw their toddler up on an unbroke horse to see what will happen see before i got my tubes tied people told me i should have kids and that no matter how much i disliked them its different when theyre your own based upon the things i read on the internet many parents want them to shut up and stop moving every bit as much as i would will be easy to finish your way he is the quietest stud in my area suitable for even a beginner horseperson could finish his training with barely any help awesome yes recommend that a beginner try to train your three year old stallion thats a great idea take him out alone or with others he doesnt care only had to get his feet trimmed once in his whole life so far cause everytime the farrier came he said the feet looked great whonk whonk whonk that was the sound of my head hitting the desk repeatedly he is my spoiled brat so i want the best home for him and would like updates or to visit him oh yeah because if your low quality three year old solid appy stallion isnt enough of an inducement visits from you where you blather about all the details of your financial troubles and tales of your poor parenting will definitely close the deal sign me up will probably throw color as he has roans and other light colored horses in his pedigree will mature about 15hh he is three years old how the hell tall is he now 50 says hes a hony for life would like to see him shown in wp he will make the perfect beginners horse once his training is finished he has been lunged and free lunged 100 safe and sound used to traffic kids dogs atvs chainsaws will walk over tarps and under the arbor loves his neck scratched and apples and carrots easy keeper loads like a perfect angel every time never had any problems with him ever used to minatures and loves to play used to all day turn out and only been stalled a few times as a yearling before our cribber ruined the stalls see below for ad on cribber he is a solid bay with one sock and a small white spot on his front leg hard to see unless you just bathed him and a star and snip if not sold i will keep him and geld him this fall and finish his training related to the grand finale skip a charge skipaway sue also was related to my moms reg aqha gelding sunsational music who passed away due to colic so which means twister is also distantly related to some doc bar bloodlines of course you cant verify any of this because hes not registered you deliberately bred a grade horse and kept him a stallion you suck if i didnt have to downsize right now i would keep him a stud and finish off his training with a friend of mines help and show and trail ride him yeah you sound like a serious show rider hey i could be wrong maybe you and old twister are going to clean up later this summer in the egg and spoon race my mustang mare kit is possibly bred to him for a 09 foal which if kit is in foal to him for next year i will be keeping her until the foal is weaned and keep the foal and do its training myself like i trained and worked with twister twister is a must see and work with him a little for yourself cause there isn t another 3yr old stud thats as quiet or as friendly with no bad manners or habits you could ever find i can find one by walking out to my barn and mine is good looking course i didnt buy him for 1000 either if you are in the breeding business and want to make good quiet foals he will be your stud for life cause as easy as his dam and he is to work with then his foals should be born friendly and family safe i could have his dam follow me down the road with nothing on her and she would follow my outstretched hand anywhere i went there are horses just like this on their way to mexico in double deckers right now how can you possibly be so ignorant that you dont know this update twister is officially a daddy now since the 4th of july bay filly w star other markings will show after she sheds out of her baby fur yep just you wait til she sheds out shell shed out with spots all over really its like how sorrel colts turn into palominos if you just wait long enough there are some folks on horsetopia wholl argue that all day dam nila moms mare is a black brown mare and filly looks almost like twister when he was born so twister should throw some color if bred to mares who throw color or will throw color great so hes got at least one grade shitter foal on the ground and another on the way already great rode a horse on july 13th 2008 and fell in love with him so i am going to ask the woman who has the gelding to find me one just about like that horse since he is already almost sold to someone else soon and costs 1 200 to find me a gelding that is well trained and has a perfect jog that i do not bounce around and sit perfectly on and click with that i will keep forever cause even though i iz a hors trayner i cant sit a goddamn trot mom wants me to downsize and i need to so i can afford car insurance and gas money along with my sons minis and one horse for me and save up money for a place of my own someday where i can afford to keep more then one horse for myself i just want to send this sentence to dave ramsey and see if his head explodes monica you seem to be an adult with a child of your own why does your mom still need to tell you that you need to have fewer horses so you can afford car insurance and gas money hoping to ride twister on short trail ride behind my house this week july13 july 19th to how well he does and be sure of how he will do on the trails since he doesnt spook at anything at home and trusts me he should do good for me on the trails no trades got on him 7 14 2008 did good learning side passes back up and turning does nothing wrong at all dis mounted and mounted him from both sides and he stoodstill perfectly

671257 mitzie isnt used to dogs following her when she has a kid being led around on her back and i just do not have the time to work with her if trading mini for mini if its broke to ride or drive is a plus or just to ride my 3yr old son helps me care for the minis so if trading the mini mare will be very spoiled but cannot come into the house since his grandparents forebode it when they put in new flooring lol
671258 i need the pasture space and since i keep my horses at my parents place they had said i need to get her a new good home asap as i have a part time job and too many horses and ponies to work with and have the time to work with jackie after she finishes her weight gain so i must downsize
671259 notes on them from the bank saying the money is in there
671260 i will trade you my fugly mini who cant be ridden around distractions of any kind and my bad parents wont let her come into the house lol for your kid safe lighter colored pony that wont kick the shit out of my dogs
671261 monica you seem to be an adult with a child of your own why does your mom still need to tell you that you need to have fewer horses so you can afford car insurance and gas money

671298 this is a new type of music mostly spearheaded by youngsters in urban centers hence the name urban grooves
671299 off course our elders in the music industry always try to do us down but the real factor is that our music is here to stay can you imagine museve making it in the few years to come
671300 closely resembles american rap hip hop rnb soul and other international music genres
671301 we grew being made to listen to guys like lionel ritchie dolly parton and all those american and european artists by our parents later on we chose to have our own taste in music and hence we started liking urban american music because we had been exposed to such foreign music from young age now that we are doing it using local languages people see it wrong urban grooves is here to stay
671302 my titles on my songs are all inspired by macheso i take his shona titles for his albums and songs and i put them into english with his full support
671303 on my new album macheso is going to be there as well in actual fact he is my mentor
671304 the moment you box an artist and label them a museve artist or urban groover then there is no room for diversity
671305 some of us have been boxed for sure but then there are same of us who opt to go out of the box and then come back
671306 i was always mature for my years because of the parental part of it
671307 i placed a stray cat inside of the box and next to the cat i placed an excerpt from the summer and winter annals
671308 i suppose there is no way of stopping you from telling me why you did that
671309 the cat in the box is either enlightened or unenlightened depending on whether or not it has absorbed the text however theres no way of knowing what state the cat is in unless an observer opens the box
671310 do you not want to know whether or not the cat is enlightened
671311 i can say with all honesty that i do not know
671312 only if you do not tell me whether or not the cat is enlightened
671313 how long do you suppose can a cat last without food or fresh air or water
671314 it is somewhat less abstract than a parable i am afraid
671315 perhaps this is a sign that you should give up science forever and go have and a good round of meditation
671316 i mean i think i should use rats instead of cats they are smaller require less oxygen
671317 i think you should go to sleep you have a big day of meditation ahead of you tomorrow
671318 maybe i should put in some of those little pellets
671319 i am a simple man and so i have a simple suggestion you should give your money to charity in accordance with the teachings of the buddha
671320 well you would give the money to the less fortunate
671321 but then i would cease to be in possession of the money
671322 i am afraid that is just how giving away money works your highness
671323 i must admit that all of this esoteric religious talk is going straight over my head
671324 i call upon the mid level functionary of the local communist party
671325 what do you think we should do with the money
671326 i must consult the infinitely wise teachings of chairman tang
671327 the book states that you must use the money to fund a violent overthrow of yourself your highness
671328 does anyone have any suggestions that do not involve me giving away the money
671329 it seems clear to me that the folk assembled here will never come to an agreement about what to do with the money what you should do therefore is hire men who are experts in the field of properly allocating funding
671330 you should expand the massive state bureaucracy even further and let it make the difficult decisions in the most efficient manner possible
671331 then it is settled how many more finance ministers do you think you need
671332 i would say ten to twelve finance ministers your majesty
671333 the money shall be used to hire eleven new finance ministers who will be charged with determining how to spend the money
671334 the people are lucky to have a ruler who consults them about the important issues now what did i do with that bowl of plums
671335 wah you are all grown up already even with a baby now
671336 yah lah you only think the worst of people lah so suspicious for what mad

671354 naah youre tankin in the polls and at your last event the only ones who showed up were two hari krishnas a wino and that lady with the hormone problem yvpac likes to spend their money on candidates who arent afraid to articulate their policy positions and have lived in the state they want to represent long enough to actually unpack their suitcase i guess theyve sorta lost their taste for faux cowboys in jeans and ivy league blazers and besides you cant drive the danged pick up anyway remember

671357 scott is still duping a few but people are getting to know him just like we are getting to know obama and steadily increasing his chances of never getting elected in nebraska ever
671358 is kleeb really the best candidate the nebraska democratic party could find if so it is becoming increasingly obvious that the party had best spend their money and lend their support to a different democratic candidate in a different race mike johanns has this race won
671359 a major event would need to happen for the seat to come into play
671360 republicans seem likely to retain the seat in nebraska where former u s agriculture secretary mike johanns who is also a former two term governor is running against democrat scott kleeb a rancher and part time college instructor who lost a house race in 2006
671361 hypocrisy can afford to be magnificent in its promises for never intending to go beyond promises it costs nothing

671379 i have not even begun to make my bacon yet
671380 oh master lu i did not see you come in
671381 i am attempting to apply the principles of science to my quest for enlightenment
671382 would it not be more efficient for you to apply the principles of meditation to your quest for enlightenment
671383 in the first i have a page from the annals of shandong monastery in the second a page from the chronicle of master huai
671384 why does that rat have a page from acolyte zhous diary
671385 he is my control now i will be timing these rats and seeing which one attains enlightenment first in that way i can know which text is more valuable
671386 in the time it took you to set up and carry out this experiment you probably could have read both of those texts
671387 either those old masters are not all they are cracked up to be or acolyte zhou is more profound than we thought
671388 in any case more experimentation is needed do you by any chance have a diary i could borrow
671389 you must come quickly there is trouble at the old mill

671392 then again whos going to burn what you can archive to hdd arrays
671393 as long as it is in keeping with the teachings of the buddha of course
671394 you have been at this monastery a long time now
671395 im really digging the place youve got that whole asian vibe going on
671396 are you not growing restless you have told me before that surfing is your life and yet here we have only the koi pond and the tranquil lake is this truly the environment for a surfer
671397 i dont know man ive been thinking of giving up surfing i mean im 27 years old its time for me to settle down somewhere you know somewhere cushy somewhere where i dont have to do any work somewhere where there are a bunch of monks to take care of me
671398 you are living your life in violation of the principles of buddhism and you shall reap the punsihments as a result
671399 you will never attain enlightenment that is the ultimate punishment
671400 but im not like trying to attain enlightenment you dig
671401 i mean it would be a huge bummer if i was a monk but im just a surfer what do i care if i attain enlightenment
671402 that man is insane and beyond reason there is no way we can ever evict him
671403 if youre here to try and get me to get out you should know
671404 if you get up and leave this monastery right now i will give you 100 w n
671405 ten of the little silver coins with the square holes
671406 i just explained to him that he was living his life in violation of the principles of buddhism and that he would never attain enlightenment
671407 and to think i was going to offer him 100 w n if he left
671408 oh ming your inexperience truly shows now come on let us go tell master lu of my phenomenal success
671409 for 100 more you could pick up an xbox 360 with tv and movie downloads direct to the console no pc required oh yeah you can do a bunch of other stuff too the second issue i have is that apple continues to lock us into their ecosystem a model that has worked well for them with audio but may not be as successful with video in the era of youtube and divx the itv has limited multimedia format support compared to products such as netgears new digital entertainer hd
671410 this thing sucks and im not just saying that because im a media center user it just doesnt do much of anything that cant already be done with other products that have been out for years why cache on the hdd is your network not fast enough with 802 11n to get that done no pvr functionality tops out at 720p other than mac support i dont think this offers anything new sure its really the first device to play video purchased from itunes but thats about it
671411 you can add other plain quicktime movies into your itunes library though but this is still very limited
671412 if you want a more universal solution then the xbox 360
671413 there was a lot of hype that the codenamed apple itv would revolutionize the tv industry

671431 what is it zhou i am trying to focus on my bacon
671432 well it is just the buddha teaches compassion to all living things does he not how is bacon consistent with that teaching
671433 but it was alive it used to be a pig
671434 it was not alive when i got it from the butcher
671435 i will look for mention of bacon in the scriptures

671471 and although heather does not want bea spending any time around nancy she has been told by paul she has no say in it which did not go down well at all
671472 bea adores her dad and always talks about him but she has also formed a real bond with jamie who is great fun to be around
671473 heather is really cool about him spending time with her and a couple of times bea has called jamie daddy when theyve been laughing and joking together
671474 the news another man is playing such a big part in beas life at this impressionable age will hurt paul he has to accept bea will spend time with any partners of heathers choice
671475 but its hard for him to accept because he has no control over who heather dates hes just feeling like any dad would in this situation slightly displaced
671476 heathers told anyone who will listen how smitten she is with jamie so paul will have to get used to jamie being around for a long time yet
671477 this might be just the move she needs and obviously shell be able to visit him more easily too
671478 i have travelled a great distance to be here i wish to study under you and learn the ways of the buddha so that i may attain enlightenment
671479 an acolyte must posess a great deal of dedication and persistence what evidence do you have of these qualities
671480 i have walked over 400 li so that i may study the teachings of the buddha
671481 i have been to the monasteries of master ji master qufu and even master zuo and all three have rejected me out of hand and yet i have not given up hope instead i have come to you so that i may attain enlightenment any way that i can
671482 am i to understand that you visited every other monastery in the kingdom before you came to me
671483 well not um that is i was er saving the best for last yes that is it i was saving the best monastery in the kingdom for last for some reason
671484 ah very good then you have shown great prudence now let me see your curriculum vitae and we will see what we have got
671485 23 years experience as a peasant that is good desire for spiritual betterment that is also good
671486 but we do not allow females to become acolytes monastery policy i am afraid
671487 do not women have just as much buddha nature as men
671488 i would have to look it up in the scriptures
671489 but i believe that the answer is no they do not have as much buddha nature as men
671490 do not despair i can refer you to a local nunnery you wont come any closer to enlightenment there but there will still be plenty of fasting and repentence
671491 i did not wish to have to resort to this
671492 master lu i am a man and i wish to study at your monestary
671493 well then if you are a man then that changes everything
671494 i agree now what did you say your name was again
671495 that is a very feminine sounding name is it not
671496 i must have it confused with a different feminine sounding name very well then let me show you to your chambers
671497 you are one of my best and brightest students i need your help resolving an ethical issue which has been plaguing me as of late
671498 and both come upon a plank floating upon the waves they are both seasoned sailors well versed in the intricacies of ship design so they know that the waterlogged plank can only support the weight of one sailor now one of the sailors let us call him the sailor is a marginally better swimmer than the other sailor whom we shall refer to as the other sailor as such he arrives at the plank first
671499 despite knowing full well that the plank cannot support his weight the other sailor attempts to climb on board anyway the sailor concerned for his own life pushes the other sailor away causing him to drown a while later rescue boats arrive and the sailor is brought back to shore
671500 this would appear to be one of the seven canonical sailors dilemmas perhaps we should consult the writings of master shang
671501 i have not gotten to the juicy bit yet let us say that once he gets back to shore the sailor is overcome with guilt and tells his story to the authorities i ask you this would it be correct for the authorities to convict him of murder or would they instead have to release him on the basis of self defense
671502 so the emperor could convict the sailor of anything he liked at any time for any reason
671503 that is precisely what i thought the emperor will be pleased to hear this
671504 theyre all worn and tattered why dont you go to your tailor
671505 my tailor zhiyi the tailor recently attained enlightenment and now he has closed down his shop
671506 i am sympathetic to your situation my favourite blacksmith the town blacksmith recently attained enlightenment and has since ceased to practice his craft
671507 youre becoming a monk its not like you have any metal that needs the attention of a smith
671508 but its nice to at least know someone whos a good blacksmith you know just in case
671509 i get the feeling that more people are attaining enlightenment out in the streets of the village than within the walls of this monastery
671510 that is silly and not true enlightenment can only be attained through careful study under a properly licensed authority in a properly licensed monastery now who wants to contemplate oh lets say this patch of weeds
671511 how good to see you again what brings you to the monastery
671512 i am searching for the fabled golden ox has he been here recently
671513 but why do you seek him certainly you dont believe the childrens tales of the powers that the golden ox bestows upon those who can capture him
671514 it is a long tale my old friend but the upshot of it is that he owes me a substantial sum of money
671515 i see now that youre here though perhaps wei and po would do well by instruction from a visiting master
671516 i say yes the dog is a conscious being and all conscious beings in the world have the capacity to exhibit wisdom in their actions meaning they must also have the capacity for wisdom in their thoughts and thus the buddha nature
671517 because dogs are scavengers and as such are unable to break free of their worldly possessions so limited they cannot have the buddha nature
671518 no while your answer was correct you did not show your work properly for shame furthermore i did not ask you about the dog
671519 i asked you about scruffy who is a traveling musician i once met
671520 so master yan i spoke to master zi the other day as he passed through this area
671521 if i recall correctly master zi is not a single man but a conscious collective of plants spanning much of the region surrounding mount hua you could not possibly have spoken to all of him
671522 well it is a common error in any case i must leave before the ox eludes me further
671523 if you do not mind me asking does master yan not seem completely mad to you
671524 to the truly wise enlightenment and madness are quite indistinguishable
671525 do you mean to tell me that i have studied and meditated for some fifteen years now so that i may one day become like master yan
671526 john stop john john stop this now damn it john please just stop
671527 i i i cant mom i just cant shes shes mom shes gone
671528 i know i know its okay john everythings going to be okay
671529 but we need to consider the possibility that derek is somehow involved with camerons disappearance
671530 why would he hurt cameron his bitter feud with her ended weeks ago when he discovered it was you not cameron who tortured him in 2027
671531 that wasnt me remember it was kevin behind the wheel back then im in charge now besides thats not what i was referring to derek though over his sordid past still considers john and camerons relationship as wrong and i believe that he will do anything to see it end
671532 but you said so yourself cameron is still alive wherever she is
671533 true but that doesnt mean he hasnt chained her up in a shipping crate or something she could be half way to greenland by now
671534 well either way well have to wait until he gets home before we ask him
671535 no just leave things as they are the last thing this family needs is everyone at each others throats
671536 well you know where to find me if you change your mind
671537 i know that ever since the merge ive been a different person
671538 no thats an understatement i can no longer feel certain feelings remorse regret its like when kevin was erased when he imprinted a part of himself onto me he took my conscience with him cameron was is everything to me and now shes gone and i damn it
671539 i cant feel anything ive shed not one single tear felt not one moment of sorrow just pain and anger im not even sure if i can still love her as a sister i mean
671540 because i dont know i guess i just needed to vent you know we need to find her we will find her for johns sake and mine
671541 so youre not going to cart me off to the gas chamber
671542 no youre doing good work these machines need to be stopped in the here and now i have no interest in the future what will come will come nothing can change that all i can hope to do is save as many lives as i can in this day and age go return to the connors and give them my best
671543 what have you done to her where is she you evil twisted
671544 wheres who who do you think cameron what did you do with her let go of me
671545 ill be calm ill be very calm once he tells me exactly where i can find my cam
671546 she is not just a machine shes so much more than that
671547 please tell me what you did to her give me that much at least
671548 john i swear to you i have nothing to do with any of this i dont know where she is or what has happened to her
671549 but you must youre the only one who else would hurt her
671550 i recently had an encounter with one of these so called terminators but it let me live for reasons i have yet to understand
671551 he captured me thats where ive been all this time he told me he had a run in with a machine but it spared him sound like someone we know
671552 cameron maybe maybe she caught him spying on us at the beach and went to find out what he was up to once they were alone he couldve shocked her into standby and yes it all makes sense now he did it that bastard took cameron
671553 to me the crucial thing about kers is that its inconceivable that in 50 years time when you put the brakes on in your car the energy will just burn off in heat that wont happen
671554 weve seen it so often in areas and those devices will be crucial for the roads because if a kers system is really light and can absorb all the energy with super capacitors or flywheels whatever its going to be thats really for the road and if we advance it by several years then thats extremely useful and that alone can justify formula one because it will make such a huge contribution to the motor industry
671555 if you imagine you could have a super efficient kers system five to 10 years sooner than you would otherwise get it then multiply it by the number of cars in the world then formula one costs will be a drop in the ocean
671556 that the ad hoc committee concluded that poliner gave substandard care in half of the cases reviewed and considering the seriousness of the diagnostic error with patient 36 defendants were fully warranted in concluding that failing to impose further temporary restrictions may result in an imminent danger
671557 i did the test at the earliest possible time to get an idea but it might say no now im not sure it could be is it or isnt it
671558 no matter how faint the line is if there is a line the test result is positive

671563 lately i have really loved creating hybrid digital albums they are a quick fun project that lets me get my hands dirty and i love the end result i love how simple and fun they are
671564 nick jonas is my role model i think its cool how he can tell the world about his diabetes my dad had cancer and diabetes and he passed away last year its amazing how he can get through this with the help of his family
671565 it got a bit too far maybe it is such an issue at the moment in spain it gets a bit over the top
671566 a couple of our players they made the comment that there was only talk about him and not about the current team and stars and everybodys waiting for the next rumour without anything concrete
671567 there are certain doubts but i guess the obvious ones
671568 of course it can be of help if an umpire makes a mistake in giving someone out lbw when he the batsman has nicked it and this is shown but again there are areas which really helps the umpire but there are other area where it takes a longer time to assess a review of a decision
671569 we are expecting to recieve mohammad asifs report but we have not heard anything from the ipl after being appointed as a tribunal member
671570 however i have collected the datas from the wada 2003 and 2007 codes and i think the tribunal will start functioning after the sample b procedure is completed
671571 i used to work from the days when sunil was playing for bombay cricket association bca then mca now and india in fact the first sports medicine clinic in india was set up by me along with dr arun samsi

671573 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
671574 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity
671575 each can give their best in the true olympic spirit
671576 to go back into my past and at the same time walk toward the future
671577 im really pleased for our first time out that we got this win against a very good team
671578 we did know coming in that latvia was going to be a very good opponent having watched them beat russia last night and having seen them play in the olympic qualifier
671579 we can play better and we tend to play better as we go but we certainly got all we could handle from latvia
671580 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
671581 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
671582 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
671583 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
671584 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
671585 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
671586 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
671587 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
671588 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
671589 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
671590 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
671591 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
671592 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
671593 first i want to say that john mccain is all male
671594 on the first day of the season serie a and b teams will take the field 30 minutes late as a sign of solidarity for the released players
671595 untuk apa hafal kitab suci kalau tidak pernah melakukan apa yang ada dalam kitab suci
671596 our goal will be the semi final though it will be tough
671597 baseball is not the only olympic sport not using its best athletes it is the same with tennis while football uses youth players
671598 the sport is still considered a typical american sport but in korea and central america it is a major sport
671599 seeing how big it is it is madness that it is no longer olympic
671600 for the major league it hardly matters but for the minor countries it will be lethal
671601 with chicago as a serious candidate for the 2016 olympics it wont be smart to organise the games in the united states without baseball
671602 those guys are talented and theyve worked pretty hard this year
671603 i honestly think bolt can run 9 6 i think asafa can run 9 6 and a healthy tyson can run 9 6
671604 probably 19 7 or lower for first place and well see after that im definitely going to run 19 its just a matter of 19 what
671605 i definitely cant consider someone who has run a 9 74 a sleeper
671606 theyre doing everything they can to increase our comfort level
671607 theyre making sure we have absolutely nothing to worry about
671608 im one of those people who tells it like it is good bad and ugly
671609 i like to show both sides of things for the most part my life is lovely and all smiles and happiness in my blogs but occasionally an athlete has a bad day and you want to write about that too because you want to show all sides of that
671610 ive pretty much got them ready i just want to make sure theyre within the parameters of what you can do when youre blogging here
671611 it was pretty much youre your own man or own woman and if you decide to go out and do something you have to live by the consequences
671612 so do what you want to do and if its bad just deal with it
671613 i was out walking i said hey tyson how you doing he said hey wallace and that was it
671614 i texted him and asked him if he was doing well he said yes im doing great and that was pretty much the end of the conversation
671615 three south koreans two nepali one dutch one serb one norwegian and one pakistani have been killed
671616 it is the worst tragedy on k2 since 1986 when 12 climbers were killed due to exposure
671617 we welcome the statement he made about looking into the causes and sources of the kabul bombing
671618 i do remember its a new government there are enormous challenges
671619 both prime ministers said we need to overcome these problems and move forward
671620 stressed that across the board in pakistan all political parties want improved relations
671621 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
671622 clearly theres been a number of incidents recently and its important that we go in and double check and make sure that all the standards are being maintained
671623 there are several sites and applications currently experimenting with our new apis before we release them publicly
671624 sites and developers will be able to hook into what disqus offers without compromising the more custom aspects of the project
671625 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
671626 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
671627 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
671628 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
671629 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
671630 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
671631 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
671632 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
671633 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
671634 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
671635 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
671636 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
671637 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
671638 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
671639 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
671640 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
671641 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
671642 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
671643 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
671644 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
671645 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
671646 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
671647 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
671648 that two weeks has got to be looked at from the point of view that they did take a four or five day break to go and consult
671649 we would like to see the speedy conclusion of the talks and successful outcome so that we can focus in the future our attention around our economy
671650 i am confident talks with chelsea will lead to a positive resolve about my future
671651 chelsea want to speak and i am open to talk
671652 things have not changed but i am a blues player
671653 money is not the main factor and if chelsea show they want me it is possible to accept a proposition
671654 its fantastic an incredible feeling winning here in finland means so much to me
671655 i desperately wanted to win this rally because its been one of the hardest
671656 i wanted to win here but it was still a fantastic event
671657 the championship fight is not over but of course all the rallies coming up are more important now its not over yet
671658 in terms of my offence it is just taking shots when they are there we wanted to move the ball and if the opportunity presents itself we wanted to be aggressive and shoot the ball
671659 we went to a small line up for a few minutes where lebron and carmelo were our bigs no one was a centre
671660 the wider irish community in melbourne for their tireless efforts during the past two weeks

671662 we have now collected the pieces of nine dead women and still there are other parts scattered
671663 a minibus full of seriously injured women was rushed to hospital and i think the death toll will be more than this only two women who sell tea along the road survived
671664 the government will be working as normal and we have no worries about those who resigned
671665 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
671666 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
671667 you really dont remember do you you had an episode it was rough but youre recovering now youll be right as rain before you know it and well hear no more nonsense about superheroes

671774 were watching it but thats the way it looks so far
671775 airlines sell their tickets months in advance so what people see now when tickets are sold is what demand is like after the peak december travel season once they see those numbers airlines with make decisions about what flights to keep
671776 thats a competitive factor and airlines play that very close to their chest
671777 if planes go from being 75 percent full to 85 percent full it will mean that airlines will have more control over pricing
671778 airlines have also started charging for bags some have started charging for pillows and blankets theyre trying to find revenue that isnt in the regular ticket price because when you sell a ticket months in advance you dont know how much that flight is actually going to cost months from now
671779 we expect to keep most destinations but with fewer flights

671790 kwun tong says congrats on being same age as me now
671791 more impoverished today than americans were in the 19th century the greatest dishonor you can do is to forget photographs are monuments
671792 but before war photographs pass into history they are news and records of events that are still raw for everyone involved soldiers families and journalists the experiences of the times in recent years with searing pictures of injury and in one case imminent death suggest how emotional complicated and unpredictable the issues can be
671793 painful as these issues are i think the times has an obligation to pursue stories and photographs that report the entire experience of war including death
671794 death and carnage are not the whole story of war there is also heroism and frustration success and setback camaraderie and on occasion atrocity but death and carnage are part of the story and to launder them out of our account of the war would be a disservice
671795 i knew the wind had gone up so i went for it
671796 but i just settled in on the descent at gate 1 and it all felt comfortable so i thought id just go for it you tend to perform better when you are pushing it because your concentration goes up it might be a bit foolish going for a mad dash
671797 its a fair call rolling a bit late into the gate but not by much ive seen guys not being penalized for that i like the way the judging is getting stricter
671798 i would have liked to have had another go at it i think i could have improved my time for sure i took it a bit easy on the first run
671799 the wind was strong and that caused everyone some problems at the half cuban at the start finish gate a lot of guys got penalties for descending too high through the gate we recognised it we knew what the problem was we just handled it better
671800 i went out and just tried to get something up there on the board
671801 i know i can shave at least a second off my time its going to be really tough to beat paul and if hannes arch flies clean its gonna be tough to beat him without the six second penalty he got hes smokin im pretty happy with my time all in all i really wanted to get a chance to get out there again and see how fast i could go i went conservative on that round
671802 weve cleared the first hurdle the plane is going well ive spent quite a bit of time practicing thats helped a bit im a bit more up to date with the plane than in the last few races i feel more comfortable in it i do like the course but its not quite what we expected i thought it would be like porto he won but its not there are some big turns at the beginning it looks straight but it isnt
671803 i was worried about the wind at the beginning and so i didnt push it and i made a safe flight
671804 the second run would have been more risky but the first one i didnt want to take any risks i could add one second to the time but that is the limit of the plane
671805 im kind of relieved i got off to a very bad start to the week with a bad set up i pretty much lost the first day of practice i put a lot of effort into a new setup but it turned out to be a waste of time i was meandering off the right path after detroit i was fortunate today to make it into the super eights ive got another day to think about it hopefully ill do better tomorrow
671806 we are totally pleased to be in the super eights especially as i think i took it relatively slowly so i can take two seconds off the time
671807 i finished the track and said that was too easy which of course it shouldnt have been i backed off too much but it was a very clean run
671808 the penalties are part of the game so it wasnt a really good run
671809 the wind was tough but to be fair it was tough on everyone the big thing for me was that the quadro was turned a bit in the wind so the track was not the same as in training and that distracted me im happy i qualified in the top eight
671810 i was definitely getting more comfortable in the plane and to be honest im really p ed off i was stupid and made a misjudgment and got a penalty without that i would have been sixth i think thats quite a good position i was really looking forward to the second qualifying to be able to catch up and maybe rise at least one place
671811 im definitely getting more comfortable in the plane i would think that the other people are seeing that they should be worried because the plane can perform
671812 the time was not really good unfortunately we only flew once its sad tomorrow i will do my best to win the one point competition i didnt see any dutch fans when i was flying i only saw some pylons sometimes up close the wind was really strong i made a mistake on the turn focussing too much on the trajectory of the half cuban i knew the wind was there but it was even stronger than expected at least we were able to fly for the public
671813 unfortunately there was no second round but then it is understandable given these weather conditions

671875 debemos recordar que el a o pasado f lix se agenci la medalla de plata en el campeonato del mundo de atletismo y de ah en adelante ha mantenido un tren de entrenamientos y competencias bien dosificado con el prop sito de llegar en ptimas condiciones a pek n
671876 voy a estos juegos ol mpicos con la mente puesta en que debo hacer algo grande para mi pa s creo en mi preparaci n en el apoyo de mis compa eros y la fe en que dios me dar el aliento necesario para alcanzar mi prop sito de triunfo
671877 estoy seguro que ser n los mejores juegos ol mpicos de la historia por la infraestructura los estadios y el gran trabajo que han realizado las autoridades chinas
671878 confiamos en que sea una fiesta deportiva extraordinaria que se celebre en paz con armon a y el esp ritu ol mpico salga fortalecido
671879 todos viajan con gran ilusi n de superarse bajar marcas y ser part cipes de la mayor fiesta deportiva en el mundo
671880 debemos ser realistas y las posibilidades de medallas son muy pocas pero la ilusi n est
671881 sin lugar a dudas esta delegaci n es la que mejor preparaci n ha tenido a la que m s presupuesto le ha destinado el gobierno y en la cual hay deportes como el boxeo las pesas el taekwondo el tiro con arco y el ciclismo que tiene deportistas con suficiente trayectoria y resultados para aspirar a quedar entre los mejores del mundo
671882 la planeaci n y los estimativos que se hacen sobre el papel dan para pensar que podemos tener la mejor figuraci n de todos los tiempos
671883 porque curiosamente ella ha ganado en otras pruebas y no en la que es su especialidad que es la persecuci n individual
671884 ahora hay que esperar que tanto los boxeadores como los levantadores de pesas y en general toda la delegaci n est en d a de las competencias en su mejor d a en su mejor hora porque todo lo que ha estado a nuestro alcance se ha hecho
671885 que los recursos econ micos lleguen y lo que es mejor a tiempo
671886 tambi n estamos optimistas con lo que pueda hacer gladys mora en taekwondo que en los ol mpicos de grecia fue cuarta y a la que se le escap por muy poquito la medalla de bronce
671887 en atenas tuvimos 54 atletas y ahora para pek n tenemos 68 y esperamos que ellos puedan conseguir no solo mejorar su rendimiento individual sino el colectivo pues la ubicaci n de cada uno de ellos en las diferentes pruebas nos dar n puntos que a la postre ser n muy importantes para saber en qu posici n quedamos como pa s
671888 camarader a y ganas de dejar el nombre de colombia muy en alto
671889 tenemos un ramillete interesante de posibilidades y tambi n confiamos en que los clasificados est n a la altura de las exigencias hay motivos para ser optimistas expres botero
671890 esto es un equipo que est bien preparado y tenemos la habilidad para obtener medallas
671891 quiero hacer un buen trabajo para incluirme en el medallero y ganarme una medalla de oro que es el sue o de todo atleta ser a grandioso y esperemos en dios que lo pueda alcanzar
671892 sabemos que tendr n una competencia fuerte por el calibre de los atletas pero los boxeadores est n con mucho deseo y esperando el momento para competir
671893 he trabajado sin cesar estos cuatro a os para no repetir los mismos errores de atenas como me he preparado durante largo tiempo este a o regresar sin falta con la medalla de oro
671894 cuando alguien te levanta la mano es porque dios te da la victoria
671895 pero de mi lado estaba dios es una promesa que me he apropiado y adem s considero que ser boxeador es un don de dios y si me lo ha dado debo aprovecharlo
671896 le dije a mi manejador que era preferible perder esa pelea que una carrera no quise arriesgarme m s
671897 creo que hay posibilidades podr amos estar mejor sin embargo hay mucho talento mucho coraje mucha decisi n de los muchachos que estoy seguro nos van a dar triunfos

671900 el impacto sobre el p blico brit nico y su respaldo ser enorme
671901 la delegaci n ucraniana estar integrada por 254 deportistas un r cord en la historia de nuestro pa s desde la independencia 1991
671902 los atletas ucranianos lograr n buenos resultados en pek n pero en el medallero perder n varias posiciones en relaci n a atenas debido a la dura competencia
671903 el numero ha sido muy bueno por duplicar y m s lo ofrecido hace cuatro a os con atletas que se ubican entre los primeros del mundo que hacen pensar ciertamente en medallas es una delegaci n con muchos m ritos competitivos y un trabajo intenso con miras a los juegos ol mpicos
671904 creo firmemente que podemos superar con creces nuestra actuaci n de atenas estamos representados por un grupo de atletas que completar n un ciclo ol mpico con mucha historia y que intentar n demostrar el nivel que los destacan en las diferentes disciplinas
671905 de verdad que es un poco aventurado predecir una cosecha de medallas pues estar n los mejores atletas del mundo que tratar n de adjudicarse las cerca de 600 medallas pero aspiramos que los nuestros tengan el mejor desempe o individual que afronten con responsabilidad seriedad y sacrificio el evento
671906 la anterior fue en atenas en el a o 2004 con 17 deportistas pero en los tres ltimos juegos ol mpicos los sistemas de clasificaci n han sido m s estrictos por lo que haber conseguido la clasificaci n de 25 atletas es mucho m s meritorio
671907 va a ser muy duro habr 40 grados de calor humedad y contaminaci n medioambiental pero intentaremos demostrar que rusia es una de las principales potencias ol mpicas

671961 it took all day to make the trip from seoul to kunsan some 130 miles it was dark when we arrived at the japanese air base near kunsan where the third battalion was billeted in wooden barracks
671962 very long and constructed of wood the interior walls were made of paper tin plywood a long narrow central hallway ran the length of the barracks some 250 or 300 feet there were small rooms on both sides of the hallway housing offices and sleeping quarters of the men six or eight to a room they were unheated and veritable fire traps
671963 apparently the japanese military were hardy souls who could live in that climate without heating the barracks
671964 i was back into the routine of an infantry rifle company close order drill long marches calisthenics training and guard duty it was rice harvesting time in that part of korea i spent many cold nights pulling guard duty in the fields we would be trucked out to the rice paddies for four hour stints of standing or sitting by piles of harvested grain i was apppalled when i saw soldiers burning the rice to keep themselves warm
671965 when we were not occupied with military duties we spent time looking around the place there were hangers and japanese airplanes to look at also a complete machine shop and maintenance stores
671966 one building which must have been officers quarters had a mini swimming pool in it which turned out to be a communal bath tub the yellow sea was within walking distance and we often walked down to the shore the tides in this part of the world are enormous sometimes running as high as 30 heet when it was at low tide we could stand on the beach and look out over miles and miles of mud flats with the ocean barely discernible on the horizon we could also catch a ride to town which was a congested smelly place of mud houses with thatched roofs the shops were full of junk that we werent interested in buying hair pomades for instance there seemed to be hundreds of jars of the stuff in every other shop they were also overstocked with incense and equipment to burn it some soldiers bought some but got a lot of complaints when they tried burning it in the barracks we were forbidden to eat or drink any of the native foods because they didnt have much and needed what little they did have to keep from starving and their standards of public health were much lower and the prevalence of communicable intestinal diseases principally typhoid fever and cholera was very high this was because they used human excrement as fertilizer on their farms
671967 actually kunsan was a fairly large city of some 40 000 people at that time it was koreas sixth largest port and could accommodate ships of 4000 tons however a ship drawing more than eight feet of water could reach the harbor only at high tide kunsan was being used to ship out the japanese and bring in the repatriated koreans i heard some mdics talking once about how they had to meet the incoming ships mostly lcis and lsts and spray delousing powder on the koreans before they were allowed to board trains for their home towns
671968 division sent us an explosives expert who was to supervise the job of reducing the dump an engineer lt in charge of repair of a nearby bridge said that the last he saw of the expert just before the explosion he was standing on top of a pile of explosives directing the korean firemen in their attempt to put out a fire in the rice stubble inside the dump
671969 division said it was ok to use the japs to dispose the ammo at sea they did it without incident gave me no trouble followed all the rules i laid down to the letter i even took my guards off their compound
671970 the regimental headquarters had moved from kunsan to chonju on november 24 with the regiment spread out over cholla pukto province it affforded a more central location chonju population 47 230 was the provincial capital and like kunsan was a crowded mass of houses and unpaved roads the only significant industrieds were a hemp textile mill and a large tobacco factry and warehouse
671971 it was at ime of transition for the regiment confusion abounded because the regiment had suffered a massive decrease of 715 men in novemenber 70 officers and 645 enlisted men apparently a fourth of the regiment had arrived in korea served a few weeks andthen gone home on points they were the oldest and most experienced soldiers left after had gone in september everyone was new on the job and i dont remember getting much direction

672092 sometime this rain although it can be a blessing for the fire hazard it also can be a curse because it gives folks a false sense of security while we did get some rain we are still at a high hazard and with just a little bit of sunny weather we can bounce back quickly from that moisture so we need people to remember we are still at a high hazard and there still is potential for fires to spread out there

672124 the presidency has noted todays sunday front page article of the sunday times headlined mbeki took r30 million and gave some to african national congress president jacob zuma
672125 the report which purports to be a result of six months investigation is but a hotchpotch recycling of allegations that have from time to time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
672126 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
672127 the sunday times or anyone who has evidence that the president or anyone else received bribe s in the procurement process should as we have emphasised before approach the law enforcement agencies
672128 no evidence was found of any improper or unlawful conduct by the government
672129 the irregularities and improprieties referred to in our report point to the conduct of certain officials of the government departments involved and cannot in our view be attributed to the president or the ministers involved in their capacity as members of the ministers committee or cabinet
672130 there are therefore no grounds to suggest that the governments contracting position is flawed
672131 by the way the mystique attached to this information starts to ring hollow given that information about these competitors is easily available on the internet
672132 in other words what is meant to be a six month investigation by the sunday times turns out to be peddling of information among competing companies including in its own words a number of arms dealers who were involved in bidding for the south african contracts
672133 grotesque allegation that zuma acted as mbekis front man during the arms deal negotiations particularly in the context of the court process currently under way
672134 whereas the article acknowledges that it is based on allegations the papers editorial the arms deal truth must out once and for all openly attaches truth to the allegations the unstated premise of the editorial is that the allegations are truthful because the sunday times says so rational south africans will surely find this logic flawed
672135 by readily regurgitating known and spurious allegations supposedly after six months of a laborious investigation while at the same time concealing easy to find information which casts doubt on the credibility of its article the paper appears to be pursuing an agenda that it only can explain
672136 the danger exists that journalism which plays an important role in any democracy may ultimately become a rumour industry in which any and every allegation finds its way in the pages of newspapers thus stripping the profession of the legitimacy that it must enjoy in pursuit of its role
672137 if the president facilitated a r2 million bribe for jacob zuma and r28 million for the anc it would show that the anc is rotten to the core
672138 president mbeki must now explain himself to the nation in a televised address without delay we have the right to hear his side of the story he has the right to tell his side of the story but we want the whole truth and nothing but the truth
672139 whether he admits or denies the allegation the president must appoint a judicial commission of inquiry headed by a judge of impeccable reputation and with full powers of subpoena to fully investigate every aspect of the arms deal
672140 but we are not surprised can we trust the anc leadership both mbeki and zuma mbeki and the anc have been asked many times to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry
672141 it explains why the newly elected lynch mob that controls the anc is reluctant to trust the judiciary because they are aware of these shady dealings and schemes

672149 the nec resolved that the president of the republic must be recalled and will further engage the nec of the anc on the possibility of calling an early general election
672150 the affected comrades must still be strongly reprimanded and the lifting of the suspensions must not be interpreted as an act of condoning their conduct but rather an opportunity for them to become part of the healing process and contribute in defending the unity and cohesion of the anc

672204 of course arguing that men and women have different gender specific responses to global warming or the looming oil crash is a broad generalization and one that could very well prove unfounded however theres no question that the majority of women writing about peak oil are considerably more focused on what we can do now to make life better not just what we may have to do at some point down the road even if nothing happens if the polar ice caps cease to melt the smog in beijing just disappears one day and endangered species begin multiplying in vast numbers it hardly means all that tomato canning and cycling to work was a waste of time better then to keep track of all the peak oil news but remind people like savinar and kunstler that we need to be acting not just reacting
672205 not that long ago the daily newspaper was an indispensable coiner of social currency and it gave its readers piles of the stuff in each edition the phrase which comes from sociology is often used to describe the information we acquire and then trade or give away to start maintain and nurture relationships with our fellow humans
672206 for as long as anybody can remember the newspaper has been the primary info hub through which people interacted
672207 what is facebook but the federal reserve bank of social currency and its all social currency you can use like cocktail chatter a facebook posting be it a link a list a photo or travel plans conveys the message
672208 the social networking that takes place via instant messaging microblogging or e mail further steals from newspapers the mindshare they once owned you no longer need to rely on a paper for the social currency that a weather report movie listings classified ads shopping bargains sports info stock listings television listings gossip or entertainment news provide

672301 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
672302 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
672303 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes

672325 is the 2005 latour worth 1 950 as working stiffs we cant imagine spending 1 950 on any bottle of wine
672326 a lot of the tactics they used were designed to isolate him from his support the fbi just continued to push his buttons
672327 and you could leave usamriid with nothing more than a couple of vials bear in mind they werent exactly doing body searches of scientists back then
672328 i dont think theres anyone there who would have the foggiest idea how to do it you would need to have the opportunity the capability and the motivation and he didnt possess any of those
672329 as well as we knew each other and the way the labs were run someone would discover what was going on
672330 especially since dry spores were not something that we prepared or worked with
672331 i cant imagine him being involved in a scheme to make money or to make a profit especially one that would put people at risk or even die
672332 thats not the bruce we knew he was sweet friendly i mean he was into grass recycling
672333 as far back as the year 2000 ivins has actually attempted to murder several other people including through poisoning
672334 he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
672335 because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
672336 this is unusual for snakes but seems to be a feature of small animals

672358 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
672359 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
672360 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
672361 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
672362 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
672363 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
672364 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
672365 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
672366 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain
672367 i had tried my local gym but my daughter hated their day care and it was a nightmare now she likes the floor exercises and plays while were in a circle around them sweating
672368 being a war veteran is the reason why im a successful fighter combat is a more complex environment than fighting mentally the reason i win fights is because i can simplify a fight and not overcomplicate it i dont walk into that cage full of fear ive been through war already it makes fighting much much easier im not scared of getting beat im not scared of getting hurt im not going to lose legs im not going to lose any limbs im not going to have to call one of my guys parents and let them know that their son is dead its obviously much easier thats why its a sport war is obviously very real at the end of a fight the worst thing getting hurt is my pride nobody is going to die
672369 they said they might not have lived if it hadnt been for the screening
672370 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
672371 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
672372 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
672373 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
672374 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
672375 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
672376 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
672377 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
672378 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
672379 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
672380 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
672381 dari barang bukti makanan yang kita temukan di lapangan kita aka periksa asal makanan tersebut

672384 well do what we can but thats not our primary mission
672385 its an important part of what we do but we are a health sciences university and our primary mission is to create and transfer knowledge
672386 utmb like other health care institutions regionally statewide and across the nation is also seeing a reduction in the number of inpatients admitted to its hospitals
672387 and like individuals families and communities nationwide we too are feeling the pinch of a sluggish economy and skyrocketing fuel costs
672388 what i thought my only job as a dad was to take care of you not give you love
672389 i change the channel they shouldnt hear bisexual lesbian lyrics
672390 i change the channel they dont need to hear sexual lyrics
672391 well but its promoting infidelity i dont agree with the free sexual experimentation glorified in the song
672392 the first history of the shadowy think tank that reshaped the modern world
672393 if a subject could not be measured ranged or classified it was of little consequence in systems analysis for it was not rational numbers were all the human factor was a mere adjunct to the empirical
672394 in spite of the collective brilliance of rand there would be one area of science that would forever elude it one whose absence would time and again expose the organization to peril the knowledge of the human psyche
672395 for a place where thinking the unthinkable was supposed to be the common coin strangely enough there was virtually no internal rand debate on the nature of the soviet union or on the validity of existing american policies to contain it randites took their cues from the militarys top echelons
672396 arguably rands greatest known which is to say declassified contribution to american national security the development of the icbm as a weapon of war
672397 personified the imperial ethos of the mandarins who made america the center of power and culture in the postwar western world
672398 wohlstetters triumphs with the basing study and fail safe not only earned him the respect and admiration of fellow analysts at rand but also gained him entry to the top strata of government that very few military analysts enjoyed his work had pointed out a fatal deficiency in the nations war plans and he had saved the air force several billion dollars in potential losses
672399 for its obsession with vietnam at the expense of the current soviet threat
672400 in washington circles came about at the instigation of albert wohlstetter who met chalabi in paul wolfowitzs office
672401 rand found itself bound by the power of the purse wielded by its patron whether it be the air force or the office of the secretary of defense
672402 i can only make money if someone else looses money
672403 were closest to tiki island in terms of being a canal community in demographics houses lifestyle and everything is way over their payroll especially our police chief
672404 our chief of police makes quite a bit more than theirs it looks unusual to me
672405 when talking about budget cuts its a charade of insiders giving smoke and mirrors
672406 we spent 31 2 hours at a meeting and never discussed anything of significance its business as usual at bayou vista ive requested that the council take a hard look at our budget
672407 i have to plead ignorance because i raised my hand to approve it
672408 our accountants sent us a letter last year saying we do a very good job with the budget
672409 i think we run a very tight budget i think weve got some good people and we want to pay them appropriately
672410 their chief makes less but they provide uniforms and he has a lot more benefits
672411 im afraid mr janek wants to pay them 11 an hour and have nothing but turnover and confusion in our city
672412 tiki island doesnt have a daily collection of swimming pool passes nor do they have a recreation center thats rented out the clerk takes care of those duties
672413 weve got some really good people who are being treated unfairly and i take offense to that
672414 thats been a goal from the beginning its just a matter of getting the money
672415 its going to take a hell of a lot of money
672416 i just finished my second month of the get you in shape boot camp and it was absolutely fantastic total in the last 2 months
672417 are the colors i choose wont you let me go down in my dreams

672422 anak muda dengarlah pahitnya kehidupan adalah layaknya segenggam garam tak lebih dan tak kurang jumlah dan rasa pahit itu adalah sama dan memang akan tetap sama
672423 tapi kepahitan yang kita rasakan akan sangat tergantung dari wadah yang kita miliki kepahitan itu akan didasarkan dari perasaan tempat kita meletakkan segalanya itu semua akan tergantung pada hati kita jadi saat kamu merasakan kepahitan dan kegagalan dalam hidup hanya ada satu hal yang bisa kamu lakukan lapangkanlah dadamu menerima semuanya luaskanlah hatimu untuk menampung setiap kepahitan itu
672424 hatimu adalah wadah itu perasaanmu adalah tempat itu kalbumu adalah tempat kamu menampung segalanya jadi jangan jadikan hatimu itu seperti gelas buatlah laksana telaga yang mampu meredam setiap kepahitan itu dan merubahnya menjadi kesegaran dan kebahagiaan
672425 capability to strike land targets thousands of miles from its shores
672426 we are seeing very quickly that this is what people want
672427 immediately after putting the psms payment option provided by txtnation via menable on the billing page of just one site we received transaction requests that averaged 40 every 5 to 10 minutes the best part is that we achieved this reaction without any advertising or marketing at all we simply put a link on the bottom of our payment page and let the surfer pick the transaction method
672428 last month premium sms subsrcriptions to our website surpassed credit card and paypal
672429 it has made it much easier for us to sell in other parts of the world where credit cards are not as popular
672430 is it no dq if youre both outside of the ring
672431 youre even dumber than monsoon i thought gorilla was the stupidest guy alive
672432 ax does that thing where he does a lot of axehandles really really fast on his opponents back and then smash comes in and does clubbing forearms on his opponents back really really fast and then they do it together
672433 i was just keeping up with it so we could contain it and know where it was
672434 youve got to tell these city people that the next time someone is running up the street behind a bull to just stop and not get out of their car and try to wrangle it for us
672435 most of the traffic stopped and there were cars and people following it trying to keep the traffic away he headbutted the glass on this shop door and broke the glass because he could see his reflection
672436 i was just saying to the police that i wonder if this is covered by my insurance trying to claim damage caused by livestock its been an interesting day at work
672437 this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
672438 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
672439 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
672440 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
672441 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
672442 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
672443 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
672444 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defence
672445 when youre living on dialysis you learn to live with that
672446 this is a whole new experience its tough but its an important thing for people to know that no matter how tough it is its worth it
672447 with my new kidney i can pee through a cheerio at ten yards
672448 imagine what those people the athletes have gone through to be so ill that they would never think that they would ever get on a bicycle again
672449 and yet here they are competing in a bike race its a phenomenal thing
672450 it gives people like me hope that once this is over and done with the operation and recovery period you can go back to a normal life
672451 from my own point of view you would not have to get as sick as you get before you get that transplant
672452 i dont think anybody should be forced to donate thats why we call it the gift of life
672453 even if its one trip around the rink im going to do it
672454 theres about a three month period there that was very blurry to me where i had periods of being quite coherent and doing things and then i would lose it and take off on a bender for many days at a time
672455 i became very negative and i really didnt care about anything towards the end i just was this self absorbed negative individual
672456 look at the international superstar drunk as a skunk trying to smoke a cigar he just dumped his wife and the bank took his car hes an international superstar
672457 i really got out of the mode of trusting my instincts and i think a lot of that was because i was pretty messed up
672458 it got to the point where i dont think i was dealing correctly with reality and not judging not able to focus in on my instincts when it came to writing everything gets affected by that and sometimes in a positive way and unfortunately most of the time in a negative way
672459 our tour rider was huge a huge huge rider of alcohol
672460 were talking like two large bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka and a bottle of schnapps and a bottle of scotch and 48 beer and anything else that you may want in there and you know if youre really smart about it then you can do things in moderation and have no problem with it but im not like that
672461 im the luckiest guy in the world right now because theres a good chance that i would not be here and not able to do what im doing
672462 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
672463 its a job ive loved i put my heart and soul into it but its also the easiest because my mind just told me to pack it in i just felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this will prolong my career
672464 and last but not least i want to thank my family
672465 my mum and dad have been also i spoke to my dad this morning and he said you can walk away a proud lad because youve given it everything and thats all he asked me to do so i really want to thank them
672466 i havent been me at home i want to be me again there is no point carrying on when you know it is time to go im going to take a little break from the game and i wont be playing at the oval this is a big decision and i need a few weeks to go away and get away from the game and finish the season with yorkshire im back in the ranks of all the other players and i need to score runs to get back in the team
672467 it was a pure coincidence and thats being totally honest with you
672468 i decided on thursday and talked to my wife i knew it was time to go the job takes mental energy away from you
672469 this is my life now and i was eager to get back to it and i couldnt be happier
672470 next year you and i and everybody else will be freer and have more space to say what we believe to be the truth
672471 you dont have to wrangle somebody into a comedy club you can literally watch it wherever you are and thats it
672472 people are becoming instant celebrities literally overnight because of it because on the internet once somebody knows about it the whole world can know about it in 10 minutes
672473 when i started covering comedy it was very straightforward you did standup or sketch and it was live and that was that
672474 the idea now is to create something online that gains value from being well known and subscribed to and then sell it or make it into a tv show
672475 absolutely nothing changed when we went over to the comedy network
672476 we kept our own studio we filmed what we wanted we didnt have to compromise anything that was the whole point of it
672477 i think thats going to happen more you cannot ask somebody to change what has already been a success which is what the internet has allowed people to do
672478 lets say we did 10 live shows and just for fun 2 000 people came to see us
672479 we put out a video and in some cases its already up to 25 000 people and its not just toronto its everywhere
672480 sometimes some websites wont pick videos up because what will beat it out is somebody getting kicked in the nuts or two old men fighting on a driveway

672490 it wont be perfect this first preseason game but we have several to get up to speed
672491 the preseason games you dont put a lot of stock in

672642 typical behaviors parents see in toddlers are pushing hitting and difficulty sharing toys
672643 children at this age are very territorial further their natural inborn aggressive impulses have not yet been socialized so when they are angry they strike out
672644 bullying is not an issue for toddlers the toddler years are full of exploration and testing the toddler is especially egocentric and therefore is not intentionally subjugating others for self gratification or gain
672645 toddlers are in the stage of discovering their autonomy if they do not experience clear boundaries and limit setting by their parents their natural toddler tendencies to strike out will develop into true bullying
672646 if the toddler finds out that the chosen behavior of bullying works he will continue to use it as long as it gets him what he wants usually control over another person
672647 bullies are often stuck in a negative role when bullies are scolded labeled and punished it proves to them that they really are mean people and deserve to suffer discouraged and angry they get revenge on their favorite victim for getting them in trouble nonviolent alternatives give them a way out
672648 encourage children to show theyre sorry by taking responsibility for any harm they caused they can get ice look at the wound say theyre sorry or do nothing and live with whatever self imposed guilt they might have
672649 sorry is a word people can say insincerely to erase their responsibility and guilt
672650 punishment is not usually effective it is more concerned with stopping a behavior than looking at other choices
672651 it is not okay to push hit bite kick spit threaten and follow up with something like i know that you are upset or frustrated right now but the choices you are making are not okay
672652 my preferred response to handling abusive toddler behavior is to restrain the child
672653 parents can simply hold their childs hands and say in this house no one hits
672654 she has essentially taken external controls and internalized them for the moment
672655 we went through a good six months of this procedure before she stopped hitting
672656 the child needs to understand that his poor choice is directly related to the consequence of losing something
672657 when children do not bond with a caregiver they cannot soothe or govern themselves and act out rage from early unmet needs by trying to rule everyone and everything around them
672658 young children arent getting what they need to help them safely handle anger and aggression and the preschool years are a crucial time for those life lessons
672659 kids get the message that these heroes and their ways of problem solving are ok
672660 these years provide a window of opportunity for building social skills in children
672661 hitting is not ok you need to stop that now
672662 id like to figure out some ways that would help our kids play better together
672663 nicky knocked over my blocks today and my teacher didnt even notice
672664 i can see it upsets you when somebody knocks down your blocks
672665 im sorry this happened i know this is a problem for andy and were working on it
672666 you must have felt bad when this happened im sorry
672667 do you think jamie and alex might want to try to play nicely again if its all right with you lets give them another chance to be friends
672668 i can see youre both sad its not ok to hit or to hurt well have to leave if you cant stop what would you like to do
672669 were sorry this happened would you like to play again
672670 lets put away the toys you dont want lucy to touch if she sees them and cant play with them it might hurt her feelings

672706 from i was growing up ive been listening to showtime riddim his music mi learn a lot from him hes the only producer where you can listen to like five or six songs on a riddim
672707 i was trying to get dat same type of vibes i didnt duplicate it i just used most of the same type of sounds like the ones he used in the original one like most of the stops and phrases in the rhythm
672708 dem doing it already and you cant feel any way bout it people in the industry and people listening will know them but i dont want to identify anybody

672710 martial arts was one of my favourites from the get go so i thought it was only fair to remix it i wanted to do something to remind me of how hot i was as a producer
672711 back in those days when we were starting out it was a struggle its not like nowadays when it seem like any and everybody can just get into a studio and start record those days everybody wanted to record but the producers back then demanded only high quality stuff you couldnt go there with anything that needed too much work you had to spend time rehearsing on your own day and night we would have to get together and rehearse before we even approached a producer
672712 many hours man even though we were well prepared because we were well rehearsed we had to just work hard and be patient hoping that at some point we would make it
672713 it was a real struggle for several years man times were hard and we were getting frustrated with the pace of things we really started to wonder if we should just give it up altogether it seemed like maybe this thing would not work out for us
672714 it was only when joe joe got a sample of the work that we finally got a chance to do something really big
672715 that is still the most popular album weve done especially in europe the people scoop it up like hot bread even today anywhere we go we have to do songs from that album because that is what the people want to hear more than anything else
672716 its just more music and more of spreading the message that is what we do its not just a job and we dont just do it for the money this is our life
672717 things are different now and many of the people here are listening to things that have a different sound new generation but the jamaican people love the diamonds and we are sure that we can have another number one in jamaica so that a new generation of people here can get to know who we are we can do it without changing our sound we can and will do it with a roots reggae song is just a matter of time

672748 there has been a spectacular advance but we are still very short of the mark
672749 one of the tasks of the conference is to address the fact that there are three million people who now get the drugs but another nine million who do not
672750 no its perfectly natural what you means is that its not normal i e only a small minority of people are gay the same as only minorities are left handed ginger insomniacs or particularly good at football maths music etc being gay is no less natural than any of these things
672751 in our increasing materialistic world we are driven by a seemingly insatiable desire for power and possessions yet in this vain striving we wander ever further from inner peace and mental happiness despite our pleasant material surroundings many people today experience dissatisfaction fear anxiety and a sense of insecurity there seems to be something lacking within our hearts

672762 there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory
672763 at the end i tried to put pressure on massa and hoped something would happen and it worked out that way
672764 a return to the old concept of satisfying the customers needs is of paramount importance to us

672768 a truck packed with central security personnel arrived and arrested 14 of the 30 demonstrators while the rest managed to flee
672769 they were beaten by plain clothes security personnel and taken to al raml police station where they were referred to the prosecution which accused them of assembling hampering traffic and attempting to topple the regime
672770 they told investigators that they did not advocate destructive ideas let alone toppling the regime they said they would not even incite people to stage a civil disobedience
672771 more drama than a couple of divas cat scratching each other at a broadway
672772 its crucial that we dont get spooked by one or two bad sets of figures
672773 yes the economy is slowing yes we need to take the steam out of inflation but people talking recession are getting way ahead of the facts
672774 the rapid decline in wealth is another series that can be added to the already long list of indicators that are behaving as if the economy is on the edge of or in recession
672775 all of the circumstances have been proved by the prosecution and lead to the irresistible conclusion that the accused subjected the foreigner to gang rape and killed her after robbing her of valuables
672776 i believe that we can learn much by looking at a variety of cultures worldwide more specifically at some traditional indigenous cultures and their experimental ways of learning
672777 this is one of those policies we will be working our way through
672778 plenty of people have been hurt by shutting the whole show down we need a better balance and thats why we want it looked at again
672779 our policy on scrub being pulled is not going to have any effect on greenhouse gases
672780 they have to be careful they are not seen as a country party which is not interested inthe concerns of non rural voters
672781 the reduction in land clearing has been the critical factor in allowing us to get close to the kyoto target on emissions
672782 if that is reversed it has the potential to blow apart our strategy to reduce emissions further
672783 while the recent credit crunch has obviously had a significant impact on the local money market there is limited evidence to suggest the costs of funding are still increasing
672784 the major banks have not only survived but strengthened thanks to the credit crisis becoming the market price setter for the first time since they relinquished that position to the specialist home loan lenders more than a decade ago
672785 they britain were only one medal behind us on our benchmarking last year and it would be too much for my pride for them to go ahead of us
672786 part of australias global standing lies in the fact that we have such an enormously competitive nation on the international field of sporting endeavour and the olympics and in other elite sports as well
672787 getting the best coaches and retaining them and direct athlete assistance
672788 i think they should be rewarded with a base amount of money and then they can earn something better than that i certainly think that between 75 000 and 100 000 would be appropriate for people of their ilk
672789 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperature and other weather conditions
672790 from those records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
672791 this is a two step process in giving professional pay for teachers
672792 first we need to ensure as a country that we have a competitive professional salary to attract teachers in the numbers required to ensure a qualified teacher in front of every single classroom no matter where it is in the country
672793 beyond that i restate our preparedness to negotiate a framework that further recognises and rewards demonstrated teaching skills knowledge and practice
672794 i like the idea of having a set of standards that are a way of recognising things when still in the classroom
672795 anything that gives you a roadmap for your professional development is definitely going to be helpful
672796 better ways to reward quality teaching certainly need to be developed and any reward system needs to be based on transparent standards for assessing teachers
672797 we need to find ways of valuing teachers who are teachers of excellence because we want to keep the best teachers in front of classrooms
672798 we had 70 000 people trying to buy tickets this year and each of them wanted to buy at least two so you can see the demand is there
672799 we want to make it slightly bigger without losing the feel of the festival
672800 its far better to set some ambitious goals even if from time to time you fall short i commend andrew for his ambition
672801 ive canvassed particularly the leaders and in many cases the owners of those companies and what ive found myself pushing against is an open door
672802 ive been talking up hill and down dale for many years about the scourge of welfare and the deep need for our people to engage in the opportunities of australias incredible economy
672803 it was a complete hit to the solar plexus when andrew proposed not a few thousand real jobs in a timeframe but 50 000 guaranteed real jobs
672804 me i just stopped looking for love in the past year ive gotten played three times in a row so i just quit i believe that if love is destined for me it will come for me i dont know when and i dont expect it to be soon you shouldnt dwell on it too much depression doesnt become anyone
672805 hmm well remind me if the time ever comes to not give you up so i can avoid being an idiot

672810 dulu istilah istilah asing itu sering dipakai pada saat tidak diperlukan istilah itu sengaja dipilih pemakainya justru karena banyak yang tidak paham supaya tampak keren atau hebat mirip istilah arab yang sekarang mulai bertebaran dan naik pamornya di indonesia atau istilah sansekerta di zaman orde baru
672811 begitu luasnya bahasa arab jadi bacaan sehari hari hingga mata uang yang dikeluarkan pemerintah kolonial bagian belakangnya tertulis dalam bahasa arab melayu ini terjadi bukan hanya di indonesia tapi juga di negeri negeri jajahan inggris seperti singapura dan malaya kini malaysia kala itu hampir seluruh masyarakat buta huruf latin tapi melek huruf arab

672826 theyve done a great job theyve put themselves in contention we wanted to try to help them the best we can i was a little disappointed we werent able to do anything beyond arthur rhodes
672827 when you trade for someone from outside the organization you never know exactly how somebody is going to integrate into your programs and your clubhouse etc
672828 its like a cleansing breath just to have that constant cloud ramirez out of our clubhouse
672829 look were in first place on july 31 and we control our own destiny and i feel we have the talent on hand to continue to do what weve done for the first two thirds of the season
672830 not exactly the way you want to draw it up but things happen for a reason
672831 people that want to say things like that all im going to say is that in japanese professional baseball they dont use metal bats
672832 you cant blame suzuki for where he was born and where he played
672833 just like me you cant blame me for the nfl not wanting me to play quarterback
672834 their asking price was too high for what we had to offer
672835 mls is a very good league and i think i came away with that impression
672836 were impressed by the huge untapped manpower base in davao this will be very attractive to many bpo companies in us and europe planning to locate and expand their operations here
672837 there are many schools colleges universities and training centers in davao today producing thousands of qualified graduates for the bpo industry
672838 this has not even taken into account the manpower pool at the nearby provinces towns and small cities like tagum panabo digos bansalan mati compostela etc which are also producing thousands of qualified graduates yearly
672839 but theres still a lot of room to further improve and modernize these facilities and services
672840 to act together with plans and programs to boost the overall image of davao

672848 traditionally we have had low attrition rates but we are also aware of how to make our employees grow along with the company the career planning programme is aimed toward achieving that objective
672849 in this initiative all our employees will have to undergo an assessment by experts who would help them identify their weak points
672850 the senior employees will be assessed on the basis of their vision and leadership abilities the young people will be assessed as per their functional capabilities
672851 empowerment is the key and we have been able to empower our employees even at the lowest levels
672852 buoyed by industrial demand silver prices are rising significantly in line with gold in fact volatility in white metal have been much higher than gold this year both in global as well as domestic market
672853 the size and depth of the market is a prime force behind the rise of prices
672854 batting first would have been ideal though i dont think toss alone was crucial though it was not easy to chase down 307 i thought we could have achieved it its always important to get a good start when you chase which is something we did not get that is probably where we lost the game
672855 we felt that in these kind of conditions usually slow medium guys are effective ishant is an exceptional bowler and with his height he creates a bit of bounce on these kind of wickets so that is something that india enjoys
672856 we too need to make a smart choice i think we will have a chat with the selectors we have got a few options in our squad as well
672857 market is likely to be volatile with a positive bias the volatility in the us market and the softening crude oil prices will impact the sentiments in the domestic market as well
672858 market is likely to remain sideways as there is no major trigger this week and investors will take stock of the situation with the quarterly results season ending last week
672859 it appears that obama received a temporary boost from his trip to europe and the middle east
672860 that boost has now faded but the overall dynamics of the race have not obama is still in the lead as he has been since clinching the democratic nomination
672861 the weight of the coin would be 8 gram and diameter would be 28 millimetres
672862 it will consist of a residential area an eco tourism park and of course the race track
672863 weve had killings before but not like this not visitors
672864 dont feel no ill but i cant help you with this one
672865 its really rough right now what i think the government should do is search every house find every gun and if youre not working in the hotel business it should be the rule that you dont go there
672866 unless we really do something about all this i dont know if we can consider ourselves a safe place
672867 sending young people to prison means theyre recruited into hardened criminal gangs when they come out theyre not able to get a job and they become foot soldiers in the drugs trade
672868 crime is very high in antigua its those who get sent back after serving their time whoever deports them should have to look after them
672869 they dont always get involved in criminality some of them manage to get their lives back on track
672870 i was brought down here to build a police force
672871 if people have a problem they wait til carnival time and then they deal with it
672872 what is really happening here is a gang war its if you do something to a friend of mine were all going to come and get you
672873 whosoever did that believe me theyre going to come to judgment because god is not sleeping
672874 he brings veteran experience and big league credentials to our staff and will play an important role down the stretch
672875 the new estimates confirm that a vast majority of new infections in the u s occur in gay and bisexual men and that blacks are significantly more heavily impacted than other racial ethnic categories however the data fail to clearly link the two perpetuating a longstanding damaging polarization
672876 we need cdc to clearly show the hiv incidence numbers in gay men and other msm of color
672877 a substantial number of black people infected every year are gay or bisexual and a substantial proportion of gay and bisexual men infected are black in fact the heaviest impact is at the nexus of the two being both black and a man who has sex with men yet this population is significantly marginalized even stigmatized within both larger populations of which it is an integral part a national aids strategy must tackle this fundamental challenge
672878 the rising incidence in our communities is a direct result of years of policies and programs that demonize and ignore the sexual health needs of gay men especially african american and latino gay men who bear the brunt of the epidemic in the united states gay men of all colors face significant health disparities that directly impact the incidence and prevalence of hiv in their lives
672879 we must prioritize a holistic asset based gay mens health agenda that goes well beyond a navel to knee focus we must also address their physical mental emotional and spiritual health needs that when neglected foster conditions in which hiv thrives
672880 if this socially conservative country with far fewer resources than its wealthy neighbor to the north can ambitiously confront homophobia with government sponsorship and funding why cant the united states
672881 cdc talks of the need to develop more and better prevention messages including more prevention interventions for black gay men and gay men of all races but such strategies will never be sufficiently effective or taken up by those most at risk until and unless homophobia is directly confronted
672882 instead politicians of both parties and the department of health and human services have caved into pressure from right wing politicians squelching not only sexuality research but anti homophobia and pro sexual diversity messages in hiv prevention and general health promotion alike will our next administration buck this trend or will it be more of the business as usual thats decimating my community
672883 look at the picture on the cover theres a child a girl in a red dress theres a bird a crow in blue white sky and then there are a few things you cannot see
672884 el terror que no terminar a por otros veintiocho a os si acaso termin alguna vez comenz hasta donde lo s o puedo decirlo con un barco hecho de una hoja de diario que flotaba por una alcantarilla hinchada de lluvia
672885 that quality of a thing that makes it more desirable useful
672886 their asking price was too high for what we had to offer
672887 mls is a very good league and i think i came away with that impression
672888 im the first one to admit when i struggle and against pachuca i struggled
672889 going back to san jose when this team scores first we have a really good record
672890 the goal was one of those that changes the game
672891 its been a little bit of both momentum and player additions
672892 that first half against atlante a 4 0 win in superliga group stage action was a springboard for good play for us
672893 theres definite momentum knowing we can beat a team of that caliber coming back into league play
672894 ive looked at a number of other specimens sat in a few other wagner auctions but this is the one that makes collecting worth while
672895 since i was 8 years old ive hoped and dreamed that one day id be able to get one
672896 the mystique and allure of the t206 wagner card continues to grow
672897 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
672898 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
672899 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
672900 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
672901 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
672902 it would repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
672903 like all compromises it also includes steps that i havent always supported
672904 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
672905 represents a good faith effort at a new bipartisan beginning
672906 do you think you are better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago if you arent better off can you afford another four years
672907 he was the driver and the bomb blast went right under the vehicle which put him and the two other soldiers in a very difficult position
672908 with our economy the way it is he thought that this would be a good way to gain some experience for his future career
672909 i just never want to relive that when people say the word gut wrenching they dont always know what that feels like but this was absolutely gut wrenching
672910 alex is very determined hes coming around doing well and were looking at this as taking more of a marathon approach not a run when it comes to healing
672911 the doctors have been really good here and our goal is to walk out of here
672912 its just devastating to hear about something like this he is just a great kid very quiet and respectful but he was always so hardworking and everyone likes him
672913 i ran into some of the kids from the team yesterday at another fundraiser and its great to see the community pitching in like this to help him
672914 ive actually been living in kind of a cocoon here with alex so i knew it was going on but not all the details that was actually some very dear friends of ours who handled it
672915 but its wonderful its a little overwhelming but its great all of the support has been so wonderful and alex is so grateful
672916 im enormously proud of this young man his entire life i have been
672917 he was always my hero even before he went away to war and now hes even more of a hero
672918 japans secret war japans race against time to build its own atomic bomb
672919 i heard several days later from dr nishinas secretary that a domei reporter who was a friend of dr nishina delivered the truman document on the instructions of domei president inosuke furuno on the morning of aug 7 1945
672920 sixteen hours ago an american airplane dropped one bomb and destroyed its hiroshimas usefulness as a key military base to the enemy
672921 its always been a mystery how dr yoshio nishina knew that hiroshima had been hit with an a bomb before even going there it is possible that a domei reporter gave the copy of trumans statement to nishina the fact that the document was stored in nishinas office serves as irrefutable evidence
672922 this is the first time ive heard about this and its a major discovery
672923 i felt the war was over the moment i heard from dr nishina that he believed the bomb dropped on hiroshima was an a bomb

672977 were happy to be the underdogs and after all melbourne are well and truly the best team in the competition
672978 they melbourne can put three to four tries on you pretty quickly so our defence will have to work overtime
672979 last time we beat them we only scored 13 points 13 12 at brookvale in 2007 so to win i think well have to keep them to two tries and that will be hard theyve got guys who can beat you one on one centres who jump for bombs and some nice cross field kick plays

672984 it is totally different to his other first up runs that were over 1100 and 1200m
672985 this horse is very competitive and if i put him in a 1400m it wouldnt be in his best interests
672986 i started him in a 1000m race in the autumn and he jumped out and could have led them he wanted to run hes just a competitor
672987 i didnt want to put him in the liston and for him to jump out and work too hard and knock himself around theres a long way to go

672996 i played the best summer season in my life so im very happy for that
672997 today he played unbelievable in the first set in the second set i felt well and in some moments i felt i was playing better than him finally he beat me i just congratulate him because hes playing well
672998 it might be good for the guys bring us back to earth and make us work harder
672999 it reinforces how hard it is to win on the road we need that heading to south africa next
673000 we got shown up by new zealand and that wont happen again
673001 if you think winning away from home is tough then its tough
673002 the great thing is we are in the tri nations and it is wide open
673003 you have just seen a vivid example of how one week is no indicator of the next
673004 we will hang on to the things we believe in and of the limited amount of quality ball we got we actually showed good signs
673005 you want to win every test match so the guys are disappointed but knowing there are still three games to go we are only halfway through the competition you dont really have time to dwell on any losses
673006 its probably like a draw in football you might say its a bit hollow but ill take it
673007 we beat them from 21 so weve proved car speed is not an issue
673008 i dont think the engineers went to bed before 1am all weekend
673009 youve got to keep it on the track at the end of the day
673010 ive got a lot of respect for the other contenders

673012 like jamie said anytime you are on the podium in this category is good
673013 yeah it was there i didnt give her brazen hussey a peach of a ride and its good to get rid of that bit of pressure
673014 you do feel it you are taking up a big job its a three year contract and you want to get it right from the start
673015 when you ride horses like royal asscher you expect them to win she got blocked a little bit but still had her chance lee was really good
673016 you have to stand up and be counted everyone has a job to do and if you dont do it you are going to be in trouble
673017 i thought ive probably got another five years left at my best ive done all the hard yards and if i dont do something like this now ill never do it
673018 if i can ride well maybe they have to think twice about who they put on
673019 hell work for me because hes a team player he was a team player with hayes
673020 if they feel like we can get a half an hour out of him then well do that
673021 weve been playing so well without him but we play even better with him
673022 hes pretty keen to get out on the park so well see what happens
673023 obviously we won and were through to the final but were also playing well
673024 the boys set themselves the challenge of making the final and the way were playing is really good and the atmosphere and attitude in the group is first class
673025 i can confirm nine dead and three missing nazir sabir a celebrated pakistani climber and chief of nazir sabir expeditions said

673095 praise him with the timbrel and the dance praise him upon the loud cymbals
673096 in the jewish tradition the name actually partakes of the essence of god thus knowledge of the name is a vehicle to god a conveyor of divine energy an interface between the infinite and the finite it is curious that a tradition that places such a strong emphasis on the one god possesses such a large number of names for the divine each name however actually represents a different quality or aspect of god

673100 one common consent in chanting forth the praises of god
673101 lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me
673102 the continuous interior prayer of jesus is a constant uninterrupted calling upon the divine name of jesus with the lips in the spirit in the heart one who accustoms himself to this appeal experiences so deep a consolation and so great a need to offer the prayer always that he can no longer live without it hesychasm a technique of mantra meditation that was employed by christians as far back as the third century after christ
673103 the method was the simple chanting of the jesus prayer which runs like this lord jesus christ son of god have mercy upon me i personally have found great comfort in this mantra
673104 although it was recently popularized by the new age movement the jesus prayer has a long and venerable tradition in the
673105 when we call on god and we should learn how to do this at every moment even in the midst of our day to day work we should be conscious of him and then our prayer will have deeper effects deeper meaning

673141 and when it comes to california it doesnt get any higher than the sierra
673142 when i started doing climate change research in the sierra nevada around 1990 it seemed like an abstraction
673143 over the last five years the canary in the coal mine died
673144 its almost a shock to find out how many things are changing and how rapidly they are changing
673145 its doing this not in tens of thousands of years but in decades
673146 we are going into new territory that has not been seen in a long long time
673147 despite their imposing grandeur and apparent fortitude mountains contain highly sensitive environments that support delicately balanced physical and natural systems a warming of only a few degrees has major implications
673148 its like throwing a switch you get water or you get ice
673149 this winter there were a number of storms in yosemite valley where it was just kind of spitting snow but it never really got cold enough to snow
673150 a few degrees makes a fair amount of difference when sap starts rising plants begin to grow and insects become active
673151 it could very well be that giant sequoias become relics that survive for centuries where they are as they gradually die off and are not replaced
673152 there is going to be a great deal of nail biting there are going to be constant surprises for everyone
673153 resorts would be forced to rely entirely on snowmaking or move their operations
673154 when i was a kid i used to spend close to nine months a year in my ski boots
673155 you can only go up so far before you run out of mountain
673156 its just a single pine thats the insidious part sometimes you dont notice it because its a tree here and a tree there but there used to be a lot more there and today there are very few
673157 the less snow you have the more severe the fire becomes
673158 if the snow melts earlier the fuels are available for a longer period of time
673159 what a great experience what a jumble of fascination great ice pool
673160 there used to be a massive tongue of ice here
673161 the key thing is all the ice loss is occurring about the same time all these caves are being influenced by a common factor which is more than likely global climate change
673162 on the whole sierra nevada glaciers have retreated roughly 50 percent from a century ago
673163 if those rates continue we will probably be without glaciers in something like 50 years
673164 floats as a pale ship on a sea of desolate granite
673165 the east lobe is almost invisible you see a thin flake of ice like the stuff in a refrigerator that doesnt defrost
673166 the west lobe is more healthy but it has shriveled and shrunken the way a pumpkin does four weeks after halloween
673167 it wont be long until the lyell glacier is no more two or three more decades maybe
673168 i set out to trace the ancient ice current back to its farthest recesses
673169 a small but well characterized glacier swooping down from the somber precipices of black mountain
673170 this campaign was always going to be closer than many people thought it would be
673171 poor obama seems to have thought it wouldnt be close at all
673172 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president or mr universe
673173 not like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
673174 if anyone thinks that picking a woman will simply placate hillary clintons supporters i think thats very patronizing

673185 there is information overload now before you walked into a store and could have bought one of two strollers now the options are astronomical
673186 it is bad enough if parents feel like they cant make a decision without consulting a book nobody is willing to trust intuition judgment doing it the way their parents did it it makes child rearing into a nightmare instead of a source of joy which is too bad
673187 when i had questions i literally called her every day i know it sounds stupid but i called about which car seats to get what stroller to get for twins
673188 i can just whip out my laptop and tell them the best strollers based on their lifestyle
673189 a baby should be able to drink the milk whether its warm or cold or you can always boil the bottles in hot water

673215 african culture has always lacked a developed sense common humanity
673216 changes have been made to crew structures at these bases in order to provide additional support to our top priority operations in iraq and afghanistan
673217 this will not affect normal search and rescue capability and our support to civil authorities during recent flooding shows our ability to respond flexibly to extraordinary requirements
673218 operations are always our priority we have to focus our resources on the front line

673228 i totally agree that i did not handle the breakup in the best of ways
673229 but its not like i had a ring on her finger and left her at the altar or i had sex with her mom or her sister im not trying to minimize what i did im just saying that there are things in this world that are way worse its not like i shot her in her leg or something
673230 a person can be a really good honorable person and someone who doesnt like them can completely malign their character on sites like this with virtually no recourse
673231 men and women have equal time on the site as far as being able to say what they want and get both sides of the story out
673232 in a dating situation the man probably has one point of view of what caused the breakdown of the relationship and the woman has a completely different version of events
673233 dumping it out briefly can be helpful sort of a catharsis but it cant linger and it cant just be pure bashing the guy it has to be some degree of taking a look at what she did or did not do that contributed to it not working thats the balance
673234 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
673235 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
673236 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
673237 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
673238 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
673239 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
673240 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
673241 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
673242 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two

673272 there is hope and many disputed issues have been removed and there are guarantees for all parties
673273 conditions will take away with one hand what has been given with the other
673274 would literally take away with one hand what has been given with the other
673275 the nsg guidelines apply to non nuclear weapons states nnws so our preference is for the nsg to simply say that these guidelines do not apply to india if they are unwilling to say that at a minimum the requirement of full scope safeguards and other prescriptive elements in the guidelines that are intended for nnws must be waived for india
673276 if you read the nsg guidelines as a whole right at the top it says these prescriptions are for non nuclear weapon states there is an enunciation of the requirement that countries must accept full scope safeguards there is language about what happens if one of these states tests there is restrictive language on enrichment and reprocessing enr equipment and so on
673277 of course we are very clear that there cannot be any linkage with nuclear tests
673278 but just as in the 123 agreement with the u s there cannot be any explicit linkage to nuclear testing as a condition in the nsg
673279 i am not interested in labels like the npt definition of a nuclear weapon state because we are what we are
673280 but certainly we dont want the other label to be attached to us either
673281 are any of these elements present in those agreements so our view is that all these things in the nsg are extraneous tomorrow if the political situation changes all these things can create difficulties
673282 my granddaughter said the explosion occurred when someone turned the lights on
673283 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
673284 five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion we felt the flames rise up around us
673285 the impact of the rising fuel prices on the local economy is extremely serious
673286 the entire government must make all out efforts to overcome the difficult situation
673287 to create a society where the people can live with peace of mind

673291 he was a very nice polite guy we wouldve had no reason to let him go before all this happened
673292 that was unusual for him not to call back and then when he didnt show up for work on tuesday we got worried
673293 he was a little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
673294 tim spent his life traveling and meeting new people and always saw the good in everyone he had the most infectious giggle you could hear him laughing a mile away
673295 it didnt matter what kind of a day you were having because when you heard him laugh you couldnt help but join in
673296 all the time ive known tim hes never been the type of guy to get into a fight with he always kept to himself when theres strangers around
673297 however it seems that a number of the groups have voted for a ban on gay bishops and church blessings for homosexual couples as part of a long term plan to preserve at least the core of the communion
673298 bullies always come back for more and the one thing that i think the archbishop is blind to is the fact that nothing short of total victory will satisfy these guys
673299 an expert may have gone but he has left behind thanks be to god experts whom he trained
673300 the pakistan government wants to show that we want to bring terror in our region to an end and that we want to work with the united states for that purpose
673301 but we also believe that there is more that the united states can do as well and that we have asked it to do
673302 they have agreed to take certain measures but it would not be appropriate to make them public so that the results could be achieved
673303 but we are discussing and have agreed to take certain actions to strengthen relations between the two countries and to fight the war against terrorism more successfully so our mutual objectives could be achieved
673304 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
673305 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
673306 at first i thought clay was wearing khakis i thought there was no way that would be possible but as he got closer and closer i realized he was definitely wearing khakis khakis with pleats and one of those polo shirts with the giant logo the size of your hand i told myself that maybe he was making some kind of weird meta statement about how much first dates resemble job interviews so i just kissed his cheek and we went inside
673307 pastor of undisclosed denomination with the misleadingly suggestive name of minister lester lester runs a soup kitchen uptown and was acquainted with one of the victims its one of those bridge scenes that cop shows are littered with full of enough exposition to move the story forward but with just enough suspicion to keep it interesting
673308 the games had to happen every four years on the full moon closest to the summer solstice now lets think about that this machine related the lunar cycle to the solar cycle two cycles that have no natural connection it had to figure out solstices full moons etc in relationship to one another with nothing but rods and gears and it does it beautifully
673309 points to the use of numbers as a central doctrinal conflict in literary scholarship northrup frye argued that while the critic should understand the natural sciences
673310 if literary darwinism manages to improve the way to understand and explain literary form then it will be a great step forward but if it eludes form or just doesnt see it then it will mean exactly nothing
673311 we gain a much more intimate understanding both of the poem and of the opinions it provokes
673312 not without fears that my efforts may prove of assistance to young poets and others desiring to increase their sales a set of formulas for nation wide appeal seems to be a just possible outcome
673313 in culture as in biology there are many questions but only one answer
673314 i freaked and i remembered what had happened in other cases
673315 the issue has been the footwear that people have been wearing
673316 i dont have any specific information but we have seen some indications that it is happening all over the world in malls and other airports and other buildings
673317 two thirds of the way down i heard pop pop snap what i realized was andrews toes breaking
673318 they are very safe for people to get on them but if you are wearing crocs stand in the center of the stair
673319 the fact that a small foot can get caught under that escalator skirt is a problem

673338 the disparity in the numbers is indeed hard to reconcile as photojournalists we always strive to be fair we have tried to be balanced but it seems that in a large operation such as ours we need to monitor the use of political images even more closely

673369 after the remarkable progress in the security situation the ministry e mailed the doctors who have fled the country in the past to ask them to return back to develop the health sector in the country
673370 we agree that the return of the fathers of medicine is important to this great country
673371 they represent a significant population of senior physicians and surgeons and their return is vital to iraqs success as a regional health care leader

673373 in an industry where 93 of the workforce holds college degrees the average salary in publishing remains relatively meager compared to other professions especially for women

673407 i have lived on pine grove for 18 years and the reason i moved here was because it is a lovely tree lined street
673408 this issue came up a few years ago and the council took the time to talk to us about the plans and they listened to our views
673409 we accept that some of the trees need pruning and some need chopping down because they are diseased or dying but we told the council they should replace them with new trees to preserve the character of the street there are no plans to do that
673410 this time we have been given a letter on thursday telling us that they are going to start removing the trees on monday that gave us only one working day to speak to people on the street and contact the council
673411 the footpaths can be uneven but we accept that because we are living on a nice tree lined street
673412 i could not believe it when i was given the letter on thursday the engineer i spoke to claimed that most of the residents support the scheme but most of the people i have spoken to are opposed to it
673413 following reports carried out by two arboriculturists one salford city council and one independent employed by residents it has been determined that a proportion of the trees are in a dangerously poor condition and require removal there were also some trees that would become unstable when the roots were pruned

673424 in europe the view that america is part of what has gone wrong in our world rather than a force to help make it right has become all too common in america there are voices that deride and deny the importance of europes role in our security and our future both views miss the truth

673430 the americans have conspired in a cover up of monumental and possibly even criminal proportions
673431 they hid photos of bare human footprints on the moon for 20 years and managed to keep the human skeleton secret even longer the implications of what they found up there are staggering
673432 but the americans apparently feel that nobody else in the world is privileged enough to share the information
673433 like the footprints on the moon these photos were taken by a remote camera aboard the lunar lander and were given to me by an american source who is beyond reproach
673434 i am also in the possession of classified documents and letters that describe the footprints as being fresh and the skeleton unquestionably human the question that must be answered is how the footprints and skeleton go to the moon the obvious implication is that extraterrestrial lifeforms were involved but well never know unless the americans release the information they have
673435 the abundance of refractory elements like titanium in the surface areas is so pronounced that several geologists proposed the refractory compounds were brought to the moons surface in great quantity in some unknown way they dont know how but that it was done cannot be questioned
673436 are broad disk shaped objects that could be possibly some kind of artificial construction for huge circular disks are not likely to be beneath each huge maria centered like in the middle of each by coincidence or accident
673437 if the astronomical data are reduced it is found that the data require that the interior of the moon is more like a hollow than a homogeneous sphere
673438 the lunar orbiter experiments vastly improved our knowledge of the moons gravitational field indicating the frightening possibility that the moon might be hollow
673439 its too big to have been captured by the earth the chances of such a capture having been effected and the moon then having taken up nearly circular orbit around our earth are too small to make such an eventuality credible
673440 there is no astronomical reason why the moon and the sun should fit so well it is the sheerest of coincidences and only the earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion
673441 it looks artificial its almost incredible that such a thing could have been formed in the first instance or if it was formed could have lasted during the ages in which the moon has been in existence

673517 the problem with the abu taha family started before he went to australia
673518 he went there because he wanted a better life for his family and he spent quite a while there trying to make that happen after 1 1 2 years the judge said to either deport him or release him from the camp there
673519 in the end he chose to come home despite knowing the risks he faced
673520 this is because his death is yet to be avenged
673521 this is a tribal culture and revenge is a very real option
673522 we really regret that he was sent back to gaza after he sought shelter with australia

673530 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
673531 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
673532 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

673599 i was really surprised to see all the posts on here about max being weird or not realistic or having a confusing sexuality max is transgender which relates to his identity in other words he sees himself as a man not a woman his sexuality on the other hand is clearly fluid maybe if you must put it in a box he is bisexual but do we really need to box up sexuality i think he is totally realistic the most believable and authentic of all the l word characters as he is clearly queer the other characters dont remotely resemble any lesbians i have met as to switching from women to men it is so common for ftm transgender people to start their journey as lesbians dating women and then date men when they become men its not so weird a masculine woman probably first feels more at home in the lesbian community as having more in common with lesbians than with straight women and would feel more comfortable dating women as this would allow her more flexibility in her gender role and sexuality she would probably not date men at that point because in a heterosexual relationship with a straight man he would be relating to her totally as a woman when she feels she is a man and that would probably feel totally weird and wrong however after transition being in a gay relationship with a man who is relating to the ftm as a man is completely different i hope this makes sense because i really feel he has been misunderstood

673804 batting first would have been ideal though i dont think toss alone was crucial though it was not easy to chase down 307 i thought we could have achieved it its always important to get a good start when you chase which is something we did not get that is probably where we lost the game
673805 we felt that in these kind of conditions usually slow medium guys are effective ishant is an exceptional bowler and with his height he creates a bit of bounce on these kind of wickets so that is something that india enjoys he added
673806 we too need to make a smart choice i think we will have a chat with the selectors we have got a few options in our squad as well
673807 im very happy for ajantha mendis as he got 10 wickets in his second test i think he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well
673808 overall the bowling unit fought very well throughout the match and created opportunities for us and kept the indians under control what was disappointing is how we batted today it was important to keep wickets in hand when we are chasing down which we did not
673809 anyway it was a disappointing test match but it was not a bad one we played good cricket for two and half days or three days and then lost it in the last two sessions of the fourth day
673810 we have interrogated over 200 people in connection with this case we hope to solve the case soon as suspects have been identified and their interrogation is complete he could be one among the hostel inmates

673846 but when i went out on stage to get it and i saw the members of the orchestra standing and applauding i really started to lose it i was choking up and i thought youre not going to cry not now somehow i managed to keep it together but all my life ive wanted the respect of people like that and when i saw those musicians standing up i found it meant far more to me than i ever thought it would
673847 they were all there on the stage it was an amazing thing to hear

673880 were still trying to figure out two things what caused her death and where the blood came from this is a very challenging one
673881 the medical people we talked to said that the woman may have had a pin sized hole in an artery that opened up and the blood spilled out
673882 they said it was feasible that the hole then healed itself

673899 im thrilled to have won this rally and im especially pleased with the way we won it from start to finish the scrap reminded me of the thrilling clashes we had last year with marcus gr nholm it was a very close run thing throughout and we were never able to relax the decision to keep the lead at the end of the opening day involved a certain amount of risk because we didnt know exactly how much road sweeping we would have to do it meant pushing hard all the way but the tactic finally paid off

673910 can i come after class tomorrow afternoon and get some extra tutoring
673911 yes i will help you tomorrow stefanie but dont waste my time be ready when you get here to do some serious studying

673914 a theory of quantum gravity may not be possible unless it is not based upon the equivalence principle or if quantum mechanics can change its mass dependence
673915 how do the electrons know when to stop when they reach the ground state i e who dont they carry on spiralling into the nucleus radiating more and more energy as maxwells light model suggests
673916 another more minor example is his discussion of grand unification he correctly notes that unification works better with supersymmetry than without it to drive home the point he presents non supersymmetric grand unification in the maximally unflattering light run 1 2 up to the point where they unify then run 3 down to the z mass where it is 7 orders of magnitude off the na ve reader might be forgiven for wondering why anyone ever thought of non supersymmetric grand unification in the first place
673917 anyway its quite clear that terry tao is not talking about a classical ensemble of laras because the various laras are interacting with each other its exactly the same as an electron behaving as though there were multiple slits between it and a screen interference results
673918 we review recent work on the possibility of a varying speed of light vsl
673919 one also has to bear in mind that there are incredibly stringent experimental bounds on the breaking of lorentz symmetry as magueijo refers to at the end of the abstract you linked to any theory where c changes in a meaningful way not as the result of an odd choice of units will break lorentz invariance and be subject to such constraints
673920 what we learned has important applications to the study of quantum fields in curved backgrounds
673921 this is precisely the situation when fields are quantized on curved backgrounds
673922 im afraid the supernova data is not in fact consistent with r t 2 3 indeed it was precisely the supernova data that first showed that the universe is no longer matter dominated and that the expansion is accelerating if your solution is equivalent to that of matter dominated frw as it looks you will find thousands of papers explaining why that simply does not fit the data it was just this mismatch that forced cosmologists to posit the existence of dark energy
673923 the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating
673924 it is certainly not the case that lorentz invariant quantum field theory by itself has a minimum size or violates lorentz invariance spontaneously
673925 and that is not what alverez gaume and v m are saying in the quote you give
673926 one other thing you might recall is that all smooth manifolds including all the solutions to the equations of general relativity that we can control are locally flat and therefore locally lorentz invariant
673927 i dont think it will be productive for either of us if you want to learn something take your favorite metric which can be a solution to gr with or without a non zero t mu nu you choose expand it around any non singular point and you will discover it is indeed locally flat locally flat doesnt mean flat everywhere it means flat spacetime is a good approximation to it close to any given point or if you are more geometrically inclined read about tangent spaces to manifolds or just think about using straight tangent lines to approximate a small part of a curvy line and youll get the idea
673928 if you kiss my ill let you save my life
673929 in other words everything is wrong biology chemistry mathematics and physics there arent any physicists who actually know or understand physics
673930 but when the space through which a photon moves becomes too small these rules fail the same situation exists with electrons when seen on a large scale they travel like particles on definite paths
673931 when youve learned physics then you should post the information but right now you do not have a clue
673932 the approximate ratios between the diameters of terrestrial impact craters and the causative incident asteroids
673933 the olympic games as an ideal of brotherhood and world community is passe
673934 the olympics is so obviously hypocritical that even the neanderthals watching tv know what theyre seeing cant be true
673935 as the passage of time has given us the opportunity to put their actions into the proper context
673936 their supporters can now feel vindicated while their detractors must eat their words
673937 this national recognition says we are no longer an invisible community
673938 it says we have a presence in this country and are contributing to its cultural and social fabric
673939 they have the statistics but they dont want them released because they are embarrassing
673940 most police divisions struggle to put two cars on the road each shift and those crews can have up to 30 jobs backed up on their call sign when they start duty
673941 i came across your profile and it sparkle my interest
673942 ich hatte einen schlechten start der mich auf platz 14 zur ckgeworfen hat nach kurve eins war heidfeld innen von mir ich wusste dass er sich verbremsen wird und so geschah es auch ich musste selbst meine linie ndern dadurch kam rubens an mir vorbei den ich aber nachher wieder berholen konnte
673943 zwischenzeitlich lief ich wieder auf heidfeld auf er war in den letzten beiden kurven immer sehr stark ich hatte keine chance zu berholen das problem war dass er eine ein stopp strategie hatte und somit nicht in die box fuhr
673944 nach einem guten start mit vier gewonnenen position war es kein sonderlich aufregendes rennen f r mich wir entschieden uns mit gebrauchten vorderreifen zu starten das war ein fehler denn das auto hatte auf dem ersten stint keine gute balance
673945 dann hat die tankanlage beim ersten stopp ein kleines feuer verursacht und es dauerte lange bis die zweite tankanlage bereit war danach war mein rennen im grunde schon vorbei
673946 die zahlreichen blauen flaggen die mir gezeigt wurden haben es unm glich gemacht noch boden gutzumachen ein rennen zum vergessen
673947 wir waren im qualifying nicht gut genug das hat uns im rennen benachteiligt
673948 wir fanden keine pace und es war schwierig mit den toyota und renault mitzuhalten gegen die wir in der wm k mpfen
673949 aber dann war nach dem ersten boxenstopp alles beim teufel
673950 ich hatte feuerl schschaum auf meinem visier und das problem wiederholte sich beim zweiten boxenstopp so dass ich dann schaum innen und au en auf meinem visier hatte
673951 zu diesem zeitpunkt hatten wir schon so viel zeit verloren dass ich den zus tzlichen stopp in kauf nahm
673952 ein schwieriges rennen trotz der entwicklungen f r 2009 werden aber wir in der sommerpause auch das aktuelle auto noch verbessern
673953 meine erste runde war nicht so toll ich war in der falschen position und habe einige pl tze verloren dann lief beim ersten stopp etwas mit der tankanlage schief was einige zeit gekostet hat und mich hinter giancarlo fisichella zur ckwarf damit war die strategie zerst rt
673954 in einem normalen rennen wird es schwierig besser als siebter zu werden
673955 wir haben wichtige punkte geholt aber es war sogar ein podium drin
673956 wir haben hart gek mpft und die pace war da das ist ermutigend f r den rest der saison
673957 leider habe ich einen kleinen fehler auf der ersten runde gemacht wodurch ich zwei pl tze verloren habe
673958 so ein gutes ergebnis in meinem ersten jahr zu holen ist fantastisch
673959 ich hatte einige probleme und kimi schloss zu mir auf
673960 aber ich wusste aus dem letzten jahr in der gp2 als ich selbst mit einem schnellen auto im mittelfeld fest hing dass es schwierig ist zu berholen
673961 this new platform will enable us to keep up with traffic growth while ensuring delicious is responsive and reliable

673967 we have a very good result on possession it doesnt matter if its a travel retail market or a domestic market if its hong kong china korea or the philippines the possession product line is selling really well right now because first of all it is our entry level price watch which is very simple and you can wear it daily this is actually the first jewelry collection since 1990 and the special thing about this collection is that you can rotate the ring and also the pendant you can play around with it
673968 we have different models with yellow gold white gold rose gold bezel with diamonds
673969 launched this year is the rose gold with diamond version and the rose gold with pink sapphire to diamond from very dark pink to very light and in the end you have a few diamonds around the watch face later on you will also have diamonds inside dial or a whole link of diamonds in a cuff and these are the high jewelry pieces
673970 its always good to have the small round watch but the trend nowadays everything is bigger it really depends if its daily use of course the possession product line would be good or if you are going to an event a cocktail party or something like that magic hour would be good because you show more diamonds magic hour has the oval shape here its the same as another line called casino popular in macau and las vegas which is also very exclusive so the oval shape is also a very popular watch in piaget
673971 we always say that piaget has two hearts one heart is the watchmaker and the other is the jeweler we have two manufacturers in a small town called la c te aux f es this is actually our very first factory and in geneva at our headquarters whats the difference the first only produces movements from the design of the movement to assembling and the second manufacturer is everything you do except the movement making the assembling polishing the design we call it from a z manufacturers theres none of the process that we outsource in the world there are only three brands that are doing a z manufactures and piaget is one of them so we are always proud because everything is our own it is also one way to explain why the pieces are high value
673972 the surplus would be lower than 2 5 billion because of portfolio investment outflows the review is ongoing and there would be a revision in the capital and financial account
673973 the course of action for the wto will become clearer when the dust settles but the collective feeling here in geneva is that we cant stay where we are
673974 it should come as no surprise that their voices and presence are strongly felt in the wto
673975 for the first time developing countries are closely involved at all stages of the negotiating process through the contributions of coalitions such as the g20 or the g33 both of which the philippines is a member
673976 all members need now to seriously reflect about if and when we can jump the obstacle of what was not possible last week
673977 as is the rule at the wto the negotiations took place in concentric circles from smaller to larger groups always ensuring wide representation of the different interests at stake through the entire process it is nevertheless clear that no deal can be concluded until everyone is on board
673978 there are two main school s of thought on this issue those who say that the safeguard should only be allowed to help developing countries cope with the effects of trade opening and who would therefore link safeguards to the commitments to trade opening resulting from this round on the other side there are those who believe that such instrument should be available to help developing countries cope with existing commitments these two views need to come closer to each other if we are to reach convergence
673979 the well known analogy in trade circles is that trade opening is like a bicycle it has to keep moving forward or else it falls down we need to keep our trade rules in tune with current needs and this necessitates revisiting these rules regularly as we are doing now over ten years after the previous uruguay round of trade talks
673980 the doha package has even become more important today with rising food prices and turbulence in the financial world last week we came very close to an agreement i personally believe there could be another chance and i think the members know now they should grab it soon
673981 we have achieved so much in the course of the last few days and it would be a complete waste of effort time and resources to abandon these broad convergences now
673982 economic gains that could substantially contribute to global prosperity and to our respective national development objectives
673983 we also made uncertain what could be new or clarified rules in the multilateral trading system
673984 genuine political will faithfulness to the development mandate given to us by trade ministers in hong kong and someone not from either side of the issue to take the leadership in formulating a balanced compromise text
673985 since the low income sector of the population buys more consumption goods on which taxes are collected the burden of indirect taxes rests more on them than the more affluent groups
673986 we hope that if not all at least majority of our representatives will be present tomorrow today for the voting of this crucial bill
673987 we cant afford to suspend the voting because we only have three session days to decide
673988 amending the act without the plebiscite approval is an intrusion of the local autonomy
673989 we should demand to know what the agreement contains because we are the representatives of the people we cannot decide on this bill without knowing first if what the agreement contains will be an advantage or disadvantage to our people
673990 this agreement is a confidential matter that should be handled with care and utmost secrecy to prevent leakages that may hamper the negotiation
673991 the administration should not even attempt to railroad this because it has given no clear and acceptable reasons for postponing the election what theyve said so far is that the postponement is crucial in finally concluding the peace talks with the milf the senate has yet to see anything that will justify this reason
673992 it would be impractical to elect leaders in armm at this point because the government and the rebels are nearing a deal there would be confusion in leadership
673993 the package is composed of two diesel plants bidders may be interested in just one of the two plants in which case the sale may have to be deferred
673994 with the successful sale of panay and bohol plants we would surely achieve the 70 privatization target since the sale would result to a little over 70 privatization level
673995 the outlook for the market remains bearish for the long and medium term
673996 short term view looks cautiously positive as the near term rally seems to be on shaky legs
673997 this is normally a bullish signal but the break seemed to lack in strength it is better to wait for the markets performance this week for a clearer picture
673998 we tracked down the performance of the said month for the last 16 years and it showed that 75 of the total number of years the market declined during the month of august
673999 the petitioner had been plundering the phc funds to the detriment of the company as an entity and all its shareholders
674000 this supervening event is the appointment of new government nominees for mother companies potc and philcomsat which resulted in the stockholders meeting for the companies as well as their subsidiary phc to reflect the change in the nominees
674001 these newly elected directors and officers of phc composed of the erlinda bildner group stands to be extremely injured if the bank is not prohibited from allowing the petitioners to withdraw the entire funds of the company
674002 we have some common goals and interests that makes it easier for us to talk together
674003 we are sensitive to the needs of our political colleagues on many topics we can all agree on some we will need to dialogue debate and find a common solution

674042 another more minor example is his discussion of grand unification he correctly notes that unification works better with supersymmetry than without it to drive home the point he presents non supersymmetric grand unification in the maximally unflattering light run 1 2 up to the point where they unify then run 3 down to the z mass where it is 7 orders of magnitude off the na ve reader might be forgiven for wondering why anyone ever thought of non supersymmetric grand unification in the first place
674043 we find that the electromagnetic coupling grows with energy this can be explained heuristically by remembering that the effect of the polarization of the vacuum amounts to the creation of a plethora of electron positron pairs around the location of the charge these virtual pairs behave as dipoles that as in a dielectric medium tend to screen this charge decreasing its value at long distances i e lower energies

674045 as time passes the weyl curvature increases and gravitational masses attract each other more strongly forming a less homogeneous universe with clumped masses and higher entropy encoded in the dense packing massive bodies so that early uniform universe may be explained by there being zero weyl curvature penrose talks about the weyl curvatures growth as freeing up gravitational degrees of freedom that may then be excited it is the excitation of these gravitaional degrees of freedom that is the real measure of entropy it is a nice picture but just what drives the weyl curvatures variance is a mystery to me

674063 a model consistent with string theory is proposed for so called paranormal phenomena such as extra sensory perception esp our mathematical skills are assumed to derive from a special mental vacuum state whose origin is explained on the basis of anthropic and biological arguments taking into account the need for the informational processes associated with such a state to be of a life supporting character esp is then explained in terms of shared thought bubbles generated by the participants out of the mental vacuum state the paper concludes with a critique of arguments sometimes made claiming to rule out the possible existence of paranormal phenomena

674071 the first book setting out the arguments against string theory has been published
674072 too speculative to ever be able to prove it is wrong let alone right
674073 string theory is an idea that tries to bring together theories of big science dealing with space stars black holes with theories of little science of the world of elementary particles such as quarks and leptons
674074 there are so many things that you can do with these extra six dimensions that you cannot extract a prediction from the theory

674080 the writer is visiting reader in science at aston university birmingham
674081 bitter emotions and obsolete understanding of high energy physics june 1 2006
674082 peter woit is the owner of a well known blog that provides high energy theoretical physics with the same service as william dembskis blog offers to evolutionary biology it is designed to misinterpret and obscure virtually every event in physics and transform it into poison and to invent his own fantasies to hurt science
674083 back in 1988 richard p feynman wrote about string theory before dying
674084 string theorists hate feynman and want to destroy the credibility of physics by turning it into a religion check out the 1 million templeton prize for religion which has been awarded to string theory advocates including davies and barrow string theorists will be bitterly disappointed to discover that the book as actually printed and published someone bitter has reviewed a two year old draft version of the book here on amazon has been proof read very carefully and does not contain any errors of fact
674085 string theory is usually presented without evidence but with excess hype as being the
674086 the actual major problems facing physics concern 1 dynamical predictive unification of gravity general relativity and the standard model string theory is merely consistent with a spin 2 graviton force boson and makes no predictions that can be checked 2 the quantitative masses and gravity strength these are all a related problem since gravity acts on mass rather than charge so the standard model doesnt describe any of this and 3 the actual mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking i
674087 lets spell it out string theory is so vague it is consistent with about 1 followed by 350 zeroes different ground states
674088 the emperor has no clothes and will crucify you for saying so
674089 as we will see the term superstring theory really refers not to a well defined theory but to unrealised hopes as a result this is a theory that makes no predictions this very lack of falsifiability is what has allowed the whole subject to flourish
674090 if robert matthews or anyone else thinks that physics at the planck scale is not governed by anything like string m theory they can try to publish their alternative answer in any scientific journal or the preprint server
674091 everyone knows that people like matthews or woit have no alternatives theyre orders of magnitude and decades of education from being able to do something like that
674092 in addition to the dimensionality issue the string theory approach is so far in almost all respects restricted to being merely a perturbation theory
674093 if you look closely at lubos motls blog you can see he is now saying even dr matthews is
674094 dr matthews has done possibly more to support science than any other journalist in the uk
674095 who is a senior physicist to dr motl someone deluded thats for sure people who hate feynmans objectivity so much as dr motl and try to mix gibberish with personal attacks while standing behind the cover of dr motl are very respectable imho
674096 or perhaps nobody warped is hiding behind dr motl and he is attacking british science reporters off his own back i think this is the case ed witten and lisa randall would never be so cowardly they have more integrity than that and dont behave this way
674097 even for m inertial m gravitational m appears in the denominator of the kinetic energy term and the numerator of the potential energy term of the hamiltonian
674098 m remains in the quantized equations of motion even for m gt gt m though m cancels out of the classical equations of motion in newtonian gravity one would expect m to cancel out when averaging over states with large quantum numbers that puts them effectively in the classical continuum
674099 string theory has the remarkable property of predicting quantum gravity
674100 to my knowledge my approach to the problem preventing the development of a theory of quantum gravity is original and differs from that of others
674101 paul c w davies quant ph 0403027 2004 discusses tunnelling anomalies although he finds that qm violates the wep weak equivalence principle of gr he does not seem to find an incompatibility between quantum mechanics and the sep strong equivalence principle m inertial m gravitational
674102 it always bothers me that according to the laws as we understand them today it takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations to figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space and no matter how tiny a region of time how can all that be going on in that tiny space why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what one tiny piece of space time is going to do so i have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement that in the end the machinery will be revealed and the laws will turn out to be simple like the chequer board with all its apparent complexities
674103 a tendentious malicious attack on scientists and through that on science itself
674104 a senior physicist has sent me a piece of text that he or she called tendentious malicious attack on scientists and through that on science itself
674105 i wrote a book which treats those with whom it disagrees with a great deal of respect and admiration
674106 the interactions between lee smolin and mainstream physicists are interesting
674107 a few months ago i had to promise lee that i would read the whole book before saying anything about it
674108 as far as i can say everything that tries to go beyond the existing popular books is completely crazy with one possible exception namely some of lees general ideas about the anthropic principle
674109 for example he dedicates dozens of pages to speculations about divergent amplitudes at finite orders of the perturbation theory amplitudes that have been proven to be finite
674110 more generally lee proposes a truly radical thesis that it is wrong for mathematics to play a crucial role in theoretical physics
674111 two decades ago or so lee was also disappointed by his peers who were excited by calculations in supergravity he also denies the difference between renormalizable field theories and the rest and so forth
674112 in the sociological part of this book smolin complains that no one takes him seriously and tries to paint the mainstream physics community as a group of evil people
674113 these proposals are clearly meant to transform the scientific community to a dogmatic non mathematical and irrational institution similar to the catholic church in the middle ages
674114 the main difference between religion and science is that science will never accept smolins ideas about the scientific method
674115 also science will never give up the principle that falsified conjectures must be abandoned a principle that strikingly contradicts smolins thoughts about the democracy of ideas
674116 the postmodern attack against sciences has had many forms and if you want to see how serious threats the very basic principles of science will probably have to face from within read this weird book that i rated by 2 stars because of its unquestionable ability to make you angry and make young science fans frustrated unless science is going to be destroyed it will continue to ignore smolins hints despite the alternating good years and bad years it will build on results that work and not on those that dont work hire people who know what theyre doing and not those who dont and allow them to reach their own conclusions also the role of mathematics and string theory is bound to increase regardless whether lee smolin will convince thousands of undemanding readers otherwise
674117 i complained to amazon about lubos motl smearing woits amp smolins anti string theory books as
674118 people like lubos who live in glass houses should not throw stones
674119 lubos was in reality fired last week or so from harvard physics department outwardly he
674120 these people are openly declaring that they are going to commit scientific misconduct that will be paid for by the united nations
674121 if they find an error in the summary they wont fix it
674122 instead they will adjust the technical report so that it looks consistent
674123 one of his inventions used for military defense of syracuse against the invading romans was the claw of archimedes
674124 these people are openly declaring that they are going to commit scientific misconduct that will be paid for by the united nations
674125 if they find an error in the summary they wont fix it
674126 instead they will adjust the technical report so that it looks consistent
674127 we have gone over this already you are not applying the equations correctly the conclusions are incorrect due to a misapplication of physical law see my comments above i am turning comments off for this
674128 you are not defending science you are defending misguided and incompetently performed calculations which i cannot abide
674129 you are using the expression for rest mass that means literally mass at rest in some reference frame but you know that the early universe was radiative all particles were moving randomly and very close to the speed of light so almost all their energy was in the momentum p part of the full expression e sqrt p c 2 m c 2 2 because of the randomness there was no reference frame in which p 0
674130 gt the gravitational potential energy e mmg r m 2 g ct most quantities which you put in this expression are ill or un defined
674131 in general relativity which you must and claim to use in this context energy does not stand alone as a separately conserved quantity its just one component of the 4 4 energy momentum tensor
674132 your m is supposed to be the rest mass of the universe which is neither at rest nor to the best of our knowledge finite so you have an infinity squared there
674133 your r c t looks like it could be the hubble radius up to some factor of order unity e
674134 defined as the effective distance the majority of the mass would be moving if the universe collapsed
674135 so you are equating an incorrect expression for an ill defined e with an undefined quantity containing a square of an ill defined presumably infinite m divided by 0
674136 general relativity fully contains special relativity to do serious cosmology you need to solve the equations of general relativity you are not doing that
674137 again ill defined but lets say you take the standard frw solutions of einsteins equations put yourself in the comoving frame and compute the gravitational potential of a test particle according to your prescription since the frw solutions are isotropic your result will 0 so now youre saying that taking the square of an ill defined presumably infinite m and dividing by 0 yields 0
674138 because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others defend lukewarmly in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them
674139 my way of looking at things was completely new and i could not deduce it from other known mathematical schemes but i knew what i had done was right
674140 it is fundamentally wrong that you dont have to take the exclusion principle into account
674141 one could not talk about the trajectory of an electron in the atom because it was something not observable
674142 the beat of a different drum the life and sciece of richard feynman
674143 at a fundamental level special relativity is based on kleinian geometry
674144 lee smolin is a textbook example of a crank and what it means
674145 in the paper he argues nothing less than that virtually all theories of physics are equivalent to each other
674146 how big a lunatic you have to be to read a paper about a completely randomly chosen primitive formula claimed to describe all physical theories in the world and to believe that the author who has already written dozens of articles of the same kind is a serious physicist
674147 the only small problem with his hypothesis that even lee smolin himself is able to see is that his theory doesnt seem to contain fermions
674148 well if his iq were 40 points above his current level so that he could compete with average graduate students and or if his scientific integrity were 1 000 times higher and i am not really sure which of these two conditions is more relevant to his case he might be able to see a slightly more extensive set of challenges faced by his
674149 it is trivial to see that the spectra of two theories e
674150 theories are determined by their dynamical laws technically by hamiltonians actions or s matrices the latter is
674151 i urge paul ginsparg to cancel the endorsements needed for the author of this crackpot paper and dozens of others to submit additional preprints to the hep th archive
674152 wrote a completely objective polite and innocent review of smolins book explaining why his opinions about physics are nonsensical
674153 paradox with a lot of these popular physics books particularly when they are written by members of the academy it is often difficult to distinguish between the real scholarship on the one hand and the prevailing academic herd orthodoxy on the other in which many assertions are simply accepted without the requirement of evidence much less proof
674154 climatologists estimate that implementing the kyoto protocol would by 2100 avoid only 0 14 degrees c of temperature rise that means projected man made greenhouse warming that might have been 3 degrees c by 2100 would instead be 2 86 degrees c
674155 since coming into effect february 16 2005 the kyoto protocol has cost the world about us 500 000 000 000 while the potential temperature saving by the year 2050 so far achieved by kyoto is 0

674157 ook help ik organisaties af en toe met het moeilijke zoeken naar geschikte kandidaten
674158 voor zowel een categorie als trainingspagina deze 4 vragen te beantwoorden
674159 theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something graham said in an appearance on
674160 to talk about your name the way you look and john mccain doesnt want to get elected on that so the idea hes not interjecting race quite frankly is not credible
674161 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist daschle said in his appearance on
674162 hes never said anything that that he was using race in this effort you cant quote him you cant find him saying that and where the mccain campaign couldnt get any traction on the issues they go after him personally they go after him as a person who really doesnt fit the political mold
674163 now without john doing one thing theyre suggesting that obama is a victim of john mccain to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
674164 why wont you go to a town hall stand in front of normal people and answer their questions the whole thing is very disturbing why wont you allow the american people to look under the hood and test your tires on your ideas but you say your opponent has no ideas
674165 sen obama did something no one has ever done that i know of go overseas and have a rally in front of 200 000 adoring fans and talk like youre the embodiment of america that he is in fact living off celebrity not ideas and one of the campaign issues is credibility
674166 all i can tell you is that thank god that senator obama wasnt making policy on iraq he doesnt understand to this day tom that if you lose in iraq its a big loss in the greater war if youd lost in iraq the biggest winner would have been iran the topic were talking about
674167 but heres what john mccain understands dont elevate the tyrant he would never sit down with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad without preconditions because that is the worst thing you could do barack obamas judgment on iran has been terrible he would empower the very forces were trying to control by elevating them in the worlds eye so theres a huge difference here
674168 well obama has been consistent from the very beginning on this
674169 we have offered counter offered john had suggested some ideas for town hall meetings
674170 at this point at this point were really down to convention time and weve got two months so you cant there really isnt a lot of time for additional debates now
674171 ap s uma boa largada onde eu ganhei quatro posi es na volta inicial infelizmente n o tive uma corrida muito empolgante
674172 na minha primeira parada tive azar com o problema na mangueira que resultou em um pequeno come o de inc ndio e um longo atraso pois precisamos reabastecer o carro com outra mangueira
674173 depois disso minha corrida efetivamente tinha acabado j que com o grande n mero de bandeiras que recebi para deixar os l deres passarem era imposs vel progredir
674174 infelizmente o momento n o bom a bola n o quer entrar est dif cil mas a gente guerreiro a gente trabalha e com certeza vai conseguir sair dessa situa o n o a primeira vez na minha carreira que isso acontece tenho certeza que o grupo que vai a curitiba vai voltar com um grande resultado pois merecedor
674175 eu fui pro sacrif cio terminei o jogo n o sentindo o mesmo local da contus o apesar de ter apresentado um incha o mas foi tanto tratamento nesses dias chegava ao clube s 8h30 e quando voltava pra casa s dez da noite j tinha um fisioterapeuta l em cada pra continuar o tratamento vou ter mais uma semana para me tratar pois levei o terceiro cart o
674176 estou feliz com o meu resultado marquei valiosos pontos o que promissor para o restante da temporada fiz uma boa largada mas infelizmente cometi um pequeno erro na primeira volta e perdi as duas coloca es que havia ganho
674177 isso mostra que n o podemos ter o menor erro continuo meu aprendizado e estou determinado a manter os meus progressos
674178 mas n o foi t o f cil como sugere o placar estava um tanto nervoso no segundo set quando ela tentou uma rea o
674179 apenas inacredit vel eu n o consegui acreditar quando vi o problema do massa e eu estava na segunda posi o eu fiquei sob press o do kimi e tive muitas dificuldades
674180 eu tinha um bom carro que estava perfeito at o ltimo trecho
674181 nao fizemos um trabalho suficiente na classifica o o que nos prejudicou na corrida
674182 tivemos problemas para encontrar ritmo e foi dif cil ficar com as toyota e as renault com quem estamos brigando no campeonato vamos esperar que isto seja s nesta pista e que possamos dar a volta por cima em val ncia
674183 eu peguei um pouco de tr nsito antes de minha ltima parada o que permitiu a nick heidfeld me passar sen o eu n o poderia ter conseguido mais nada hoje domingo
674184 o que eu poderia fazer quando tenho um pneu furado no ano passado eu perdi o campeonato assim
674185 acho que n s poder amos ter feito uma corrida um pouco melhor mas ficamos presos atr s de alonso fui um pouco lento at minha segunda parada por causa disso tive um bom carro e fui capaz de me aproximar do glock
674186 estivemos um pouco de sorte pelos incidentes t nhamos velocidade por m se n o conseguirmos melhorar na classifica o teremos os mesmos problemas se pudermos sair na frente seremos capazes de brigar por vit rias
674187 uma marca importante mas s vou poder comemorar se a gente sair com uma vit ria o atl tico est mordido pois levou uma goleada e far de tudo pela recupera o iremos nos desdobrar e entrar para vencer
674188 a gente j est acostumado a fazer aquela fun o o professor pede que a gente v ajudar na marca o a nica diferen a que quando a gente d um pique a gente est mais longe do gol mas importante ajudar os nossos companheiros

674198 that the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating theres a bit of the
674199 the problem is that funny things happen in general relativity which appear to violate special relativity nothing traveling faster than the speed of light and all that lets go back to hubbles observation that distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us and the more distant the galaxy the faster it appears to move away the constant of proportionality in that relationship is known as hubbles constant one seemingly paradoxical consequence of hubbles observation is that galaxies sufficiently far away will be receding from us at a velocity faster than the speed of light this distance is called the hubble radius and is commonly referred to as the horizon in analogy with a black hole horizon in terms of special relativity hubbles law appears to be a paradox but in general relativity we interpret the apparent recession as being due to space expanding the old raisins in a rising fruit loaf analogy the galaxies themselves are not moving through space at least not very much but the space itself is growing so they appear to be moving apart there is nothing in special or general relativity to prevent this apparent velocity from exceeding the speed of light

674201 scientists have thick skins they do not abandon a theory merely because facts contradict it they normally either invent some rescue hypothesis to explain what they then call a mere anomaly or if they cannot explain the anomaly they ignore it and direct their attention to other problems note that scientists talk about anomalies recalcitrant instances not refutations history of science of course is full of accounts of how crucial experiments allegedly killed theories but such accounts are fabricated long after the theory had been abandoned what really count are dramatic unexpected stunning predictions a few of them are enough to tilt the balance where theory lags behind the facts we are dealing with miserable degenerating research programmes now how do scientific revolutions come about if we have two rival research programmes and one is progressing while the other is degenerating scientists tend to join the progressive programme this is the rationale of scientific revolutions criticism is not a popperian quick kill by refutation important criticism is always constructive there is no refutation without a better theory kuhn is wrong in thinking that scientific revolutions are sudden irrational changes in vision the history of science refutes both popper and kuhn on close inspection both popperian crucial experiments and kuhnian revolutions turn out to be myths what normally happens is that progressive research programmes replace degenerating ones
674202 observed gravity attraction is caused by radiation pressure pushing nearby non receding masses together simply because they are shielding one another the shielding and hence gravity is due to the fact that nearby masses they are not receding from one another in order to be exchanging gauge boson exchange it is vital that the masses are receding from one another so that gauge boson radiation force results from newtons 3rd law i e the reaction force from the hubble force of recession in spacetime which is outward force of f ma dv dt c t hc having an equal reaction force in the direction opposite to the recession
674203 i worked out and published an idea that reproduces gr as low order limit but since it is crazy enough to regard the long range forces as somehow deriving from the same source it was blacklisted from arxiv cern however put it up right away without complaint
674204 nevertheless my own opinion is that some things in science just cant be ignored or you arent doing science which is not a series of wacky revolutions
674205 btw my work has three time dimensions and just as you say mixes up matter and space and motion this is not incompatible with gr and in fact seems to give it an even firmer basis on the level of gr matter and physical space are decoupled the way source and radiation are in elementary em
674206 if an theory doesnt match experiment modify the theory until it does thats the fundamental nature of science
674207 yep the old theory gets modified when new data comes this is the way science is done our knowledge of the universe evolves im surprised you think it surprising
674208 please explain why it does not flow into matter that is not conveniently placed and how it discriminates how would you explain the gravitational attraction between two large lead spheres suspended adjacently as occurs at london science museum
674209 on a completely different subject theres a new preprint by michael mcguigan which manages to cite both not even wrong the book and a lubos motl blog entry
674210 when faced with an inexplicable phenomena it is tempting even for good scientists to come up with a half baked explanation
674211 the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating theres a bit of the
674212 i checked lunsfords article but he said nothing about the severe problems raised by the new kinematics in particle physics unless the new time dimensions are compactified to small enough radius
674213 if everything in the universe depends on everything else in a fundamental way it might be imposs

674215 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
674216 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
674217 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
674218 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
674219 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
674220 this time he came out and threw strikes got ahead and had all his pitches working so he could throw any pitch at any time
674221 its all a numbers game theyve infused large amounts of resources behind their sports program
674222 theyve hired the worlds best coaches to come in and coach their coaches for future generations
674223 never has a society attached so much ambition so much desire for identity to the olympics as the chinese
674224 its going to be very hard for american athletes to hold back the tide most americans dont have a clue thats about to happen they think basketball star yao ming is some kind of anomaly and dont understand he is representative of the largest talent pool the drama is going to take a lot of americans enormously by surprise

674237 ultimately its all in the experimental demonstration if einsteins theory hadnt been confirmed by tests it would have been abandoned regardless of how pretty or ugly it may be
674238 since the leading edge of the universe is moving at nearly c one needs to bring relativity into the equations special relativity without boosts cant do it einsteins general relativity egr makes the problem much more difficult than your simple approach
674239 it is shown that when a burgers screw dislocation in a crystal moves with velocity v it suffers a longitudinal contraction by the factor 1 v
674240 the universe empirically looks similar in all directions around us hence the net unshielded gravity force equal to the total inward force
674241 illustration above exchange force gauge boson radiation force cancels out although there is compression equal to the contraction predicted by general relativity in symmetrical situations outside the cone area since the net force sideways is the same in each direction unless there is a shielding mass intervening shielding is caused simply by the fact that nearby matter is not significantly receding whereas distant matter is receding gravity is the net force introduced where a mass shadows you namely in the double cone areas shown above in all other directions the symmetry cancels out and produces no net force hence gravity can be quantitatively predicted using only well established facts of quantum field theory recession etc
674242 the anthropic explanation is a disappointing and controversial approach to an explanation of anything but it is the only remotely acceptable quantitative explanation of the size of the observed cosmological constant we have
674243 until you post a better explanation on this blog your comparisons may be viewed as fog sorry we want to know why the vacuum energy responsible for acceleration of the expansion of the universe is equal to exp 283 2 times m planck 2 at least qualitatively why it is so small
674244 we are all agreed that your theory is crazy the question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct my own feeling is that it is not crazy enough
674245 its certainly true that astrophysical observations of a cc pose a serious challenge to fundamental particle physics but unfortunately i dont think anyone has a promising idea about what to do about this
674246 as we know c has been changing according to gm tc 3
674247 an excellent example is how your papers on the problems in quantum gravity are ignored by string theorists that proves string theorists are respectable you see if they engaged in discussions with their critics they would look foolish it is curious that if witten refuses to discuss problems he escapes being deemed foolish but if outsiders do that then they are deemed foolish there is such a rigid view taken of the role of authority in science today that hypocrisy is taken for granted by all

674260 i was interjected into it because there was a tampering charge initially im not looking for things to interject myself to its an issue that needs to be addressed because of the competing interests you want to make sure its done properly and within our rules this is an issue that ultimately has to be decided between brett and the packers
674261 whats going on between brett and the organization is something that the players and coaches we cannot handle
674262 were not involved in it i think they did a good job from a responsibility standpoint dealing with it for about two days but the focus has been on improving
674263 primarily it starts with the fact does brett want to play football
674264 the second is do the packers want him to play for the packers those are the two principal points that have to be resolved and only two parties can make that determination not me

674300 one of my goals when i joined the tour was to win an event and i wasnt sure if it was going to happen since ill be stepping away after this season
674301 but the waves pumped this event this is what the dream tour should be like all the time im definitely stepping away from the asp tour at the end of this year but im not retiring im still planning on competing at pipeline and teahupoo and at venues that i can get into
674302 i was tripping out in the water when they kept announcing fred patacchia and i in the final you never hear that
674303 it was all business though this is only the second time ive ever made one on tour and i wasnt about to let it go i was trying my hardest out there
674304 my brother has won this event twice and all i could think about in the final is how i wanted that trophy
674305 the thing is sick it was a great event and were going to have a huge party tonight
674306 bruce irons and i are good friends but we were super competitive in that final
674307 both of us wanted to win and we were hassling and trash talking and everything i had one wave at the start but bruce got two bombs towards the end and i could tell he was really gunning for it
674308 it feels great to come back after a slow start to the year
674309 the waves were so good for this event and im bummed i didnt win but to have bruce irons there and since hes stepping away it feels good that we kept the title within hawaii
674310 if i had come out of that one barrel then i would have been in the final but ive had a great day and a 3rd place finish really helps me this year the next event is in my backyard lower trestles and im pretty confident out there ill be spending a lot of time preparing for that event but first i am going to enjoy this magical island and all the beautiful waves it has to offer
674311 this is the best result of my career and it takes the pressure off of me to get a 3rd at the halfway point this season
674312 i dont know what it will do to the ratings but it should help me and give me a better seed going into lower trestles i have a pretty busy summer i am doing all the asp wqs events in europe so it is a lot of surfing for me coming up

nature as befitting the pseudo scientific extra dimensional who cant predict anything checkable october 3rd 2006 at 8 14 pm dear crackpot peter you are a damn assh i will sue you for the lies those crackpot commenters telling on me on your crackpot blog i hope you will die soon the sooner the better so be prepared to hear from my lawyer best lubos note string theorist aaron bergman written a response to lubos motl in the form of an updated and greatly revised paper here he analyses the paranoia of string theorists on pages 21 et seq he starts by quoting motls claim superstring m theory is the language in which god wrote the world and remarks each time i looked at his signing off an old limerick which i read a long time ago came to my mind it originates from pre war multi cultural prague where after a performance of wagners tristan and isolde by a maestro named motl an art critic who obviously did not like the performance wrote instead of a scorcher for the next days vienna newspaper the following spooner unfortunately untranslatable without a complete loss of its lovely polemic charm gehns net zu motls tristan schauns net des trottels mist an schaffns lieber nen drittel most an und trinkns mit dem mittel trost an dont appear at this nincompoop muck get yourself a drink instead and remain in comfort after having participated in peter woits weblog and also occasionally followed links to other weblogs during march june 2006 i have to admit that my above conclusions about lubos motl were wrong he definitely represents something much more worrisome than an uninhibited name calling crackpot rat wiesel character who operates on the fringes of st and denigrates adversaries of string theory23 in such a way that this becomes an embarrassing liability to the string community if that would be true then at least the more prominent string theorists who still try to uphold standards of scientific ethic in their community would keep a certain distance and the whole affair would not even be worth mentioning in an essay like this but as supporting contributions of polchinski and others to motls weblog show this is definitely not the case my final conclusion is that the young and intelligent harvard professor lubos motl has decided to build his career on offering a cartering service for the string community he obviously is a quick scanner of the daily hep th server output and by torching papers which are outside the credo of string theorists i e lqg aqft he saves them time the downgrading of adversaries is something which has at least the tacit consent of the community it is evident that he is following a different road from that of using ones intellectual potential for the enrichment of knowledge about particle physics if one can build a tenure track career at a renown university by occasionally publishing a paper but mainly keeping a globalized community informed by giving short extracts of string compatible papers and playing the role of a lord of misuse to outsiders who have not yet gotten the message the transgression of the traditional scientific ethics24 for reasons of career building may become quite acceptable it would be interesting to see into what part of this essay the string theorists pitbull will dig his teeth risto raitios weblog discussion of schroers paper which points out aspects which are even more interesting for the present particle theorist to be successful it is not sufficient to propose an interesting idea via written publication and oral presentation but he also should try to build or find a community around this idea the best protection of a theoretical proposal against profound criticism and thus securing its longtime survival is to be able to create a community around it if such a situation can be maintained over a sufficiently long time it develops a life of its own because no member of the community wants to find himself in a situation where he has spend the most productive years on a failed project in such a situation intellectual honesty gives way to an ever increasing unwillingness and finally a loss of critical abilities as a result of self delusion i would like to argue that these developments have been looming in string theory for a long time and the recent anthropic manifesto 1 l susskind the cosmic landscape string theory and the illusion of intelligent design which apparently led to a schism within the string community is only the extreme tip of an iceberg since there has been ample criticism of this anthropic viewpoint even within the string theory community my critical essay will be directed to the metaphoric aspect by which string theory has deepened the post standard model crisis of particle physics since in my view the continuation of the present path could jeopardize the future research of fundamental physics for many generations the style of presentation will occasionally be somewhat polemic an age old problem of qft which resisted all attempts to solve it is the problem of existence of models i e whether there really exist a qft behind the lagrangian name and perturbative expressions since there are convincing arguments that perturbative series do not converge they are at best asymptotic expressions this is a very serious and for realistic models unsolved problems the problem that particle physics most successful theory of qed is also its mathematically most fragile has not gone away in this sense qft has a very precarious status very different from any other area of physics in particular from qm this is very annoying and in order to not to undermine the confidence of newcomers in qft the prescribed terminology is to simply use the word defined
674335 the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating
674336 it is interesting to note that when a philosopher of science attacked quantum field theory the response was immediate and vicious but when major figures from within physics like dirac and schwinger spoke the critics were silent

674338 the self inductance of a long straight conductor is infinite this is a recurrence of kirchhoffs first law that electric current cannot be sent from a to b it can only be sent from a to b and back to a
674339 it always bothers me that according to the laws as we understand them today it takes a computing machine an infinite number of logical operations to figure out what goes on in no matter how tiny a region of space and no matter how tiny a region of time how can all that be going on in that tiny space why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what one tiny piece of space time is going to do so i have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics will not require a mathematical statement that in the end the machinery will be revealed and the laws will turn out to be simple like the chequer board with all its apparent complexities
674340 the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating
674341 dark energy appears to be the dominant component of the physical universe yet there is no persuasive theoretical explanation for its existence or magnitude the acceleration of the universe is along with dark matter the observed phenomenon that most directly demonstrates that our theories of fundamental particles and gravity are either incorrect or incomplete most experts believe that nothing short of a revolution in our understanding of fundamental physics will be required to achieve a full understanding of the cosmic acceleration for these reasons the nature of dark energy ranks among the very most compelling of all outstanding problems in physical science these circumstances demand an ambitious observational program to determine the dark energy properties as well as possible
674342 zero point field and the energy density associated with it are tricky subjects it is clear that zpf becomes physically real or measurable when there is radiation reaction but what about when it is not measured in that sense when it does not contribute to the physical properties of a test particle its just an empty space the treatment is different because with radiation reaction i have to treat this energy as real contributing to the dynamics of the system otherwise without its manifestation as radiation reaction it cannot be seen as real because the energy density would be too high leading to numerous problems such as a cosmological constant many orders of magnitude lager than the value supported by observations

674344 nc i am pretty sure that the prediction of gravity is not likely to be contradicted by experiment

674361 the other issue is that when charged particles move in circular orbits they emit radiation and your model should likely include some provision for that as well
674362 lees seven promising options include one of causality and two of hidden variables it would be nice to have a convergence toward consensus which is vital to avoid a disintegration of the research education infrastructure without consensus its very hard to teach with interest at lower levels because it looks a bit like speculative gambling or the disintegration of central ideas it would be nice to see some things unified carefully like path integrals and some hidden variables this is not regression to determinism because you still have uncertainty you just have a cause for it like chaos due to wave interference caloric fluid heat theory eventually gave way to two separate mechanisms kinetic theory and radiation this was after prevost in 1792 suggested constant temperature is a dynamic system with emission in equilibrium with the reception of energy the electromagnetic field energy exchange process is not treated with causal mechanism in current qft perhaps if it was it would turn out to be the missing hidden variable needed
674363 one thing that i insist upon is that with the improvement of every theory previous results should be able to be replicated to better accuracy
674364 i dont know if the right thing is to worry about the public image or keep quiet
674365 there are some real things you can do with string theory
674366 at the same time these human beings hype abject string speculations which disagree with all existing observations over the number of dimensions superpartners etc when the current generation of very important lovable expert acronym is appropriate string theorists is wiped out by old age or something quicker perhaps alternative ideas can find their way on to arxiv org without instant deletion or ignorant abuse resulting to the authors perhaps god will kindly create an extra dimension with which to swallow up string theorists we can only hope and pray
674367 its mass as rivero and others have published recently on arxiv is such that when you multiply it by alpha and twice pi or some similar geometric factor alpha is the ratio of say shielded charge due to vacuum polarization to unshielded core electric charge you get the muon mass or something
674368 the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating
674369 work is product of force and the distance acted against the force in the direction of the force
674370 youll never believe what the correct theory is unfortunately i am unable to publish it
674371 the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new
674372 as to anons advice to me in comment 16 hereinabove
674373 the suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion and politics but it is not the path to knowledge it has no place in the endeavor of science
674374 i was in the us air force during the time of the vietnam war which war i opposed it was a time when many people had complicated mixed feelings about war and military service and i was no exception in that regard at that time many citizens were drafted into the us military and thus put involuntarily at risk of being killed by the adversary if i am in the air force what do i do if i carry out my duties adversaries and some innocents may die if i dont carry out my duties my draftee fellow citizens and some other innocents may die i carried out my duties
674375 the forces or interactions between matter particles are all supposed to be carried by particles
674376 each force is transmitted by its own distinctive type of force carrying particle
674377 hi my name is patricia schwarz and i am the creatrix of this web site
674378 string theory accounts for the existence of this dark matter
674379 in fact sr holding true on small scales or in the absense of gravitation is one of the cornerstones of general relativity
674380 my name is edward schaefer and i live in virginia my hobbies are hiking skiing and trying to dent general relativity
674381 inflation is based on unproven and probably unprovable physics and it offers no predictions that cannot be accounted for by more modest big bang models
674382 in quantum field theory in minkowski space time the vacuum state is invariant under the poincare group and this together with the covariance of the theory under lorentz transformations implies that all inertial observers agree on the number of particles contained in a quantum state the breaking of such invariance as happened in the case of coupling to a time varying source analyzed above implies that it is not possible anymore to define a state which would be recognized as the vacuum by all observers
674383 u 2 observations have revealed anisotropy in the 3 k blackbody radiation which bathes the universe the radiation is a few millidegrees hotter in the direction of leo and cooler in the direction of aquarius the spread around the mean describes a cosine curve such observations have far reaching implications for both the history of the early universe and in predictions of its future development based on the measurements of anisotropy the entire milky way is calculated to move through the intergalactic medium at approximately 600 km s
674384 the flat universe is just not decelerating it isnt really accelerating
674385 u 2 observations have revealed anisotropy in the 3 k blackbody radiation which bathes the universe the radiation is a few millidegrees hotter in the direction of leo and cooler in the direction of aquarius the spread around the mean describes a cosine curve such observations have far reaching implications for both the history of the early universe and in predictions of its future development based on the measurements of anisotropy the entire milky way is calculated to move through the intergalactic medium at approximately 600 km s
674386 from a long view of the history of mankind seen from say ten thousand years from now there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as maxwells discovery of the laws of electrodynamics the american civil war will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade
674387 div b 0 no magnetic monopoles which is suspect due to diracs study of 1932
674388 i consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept i e on continuous structures in that case nothing remains of my entire castle in the air gravitation theory included and of the rest of modern physics
674389 why is the acceleration of gravity 32 ft s s
674390 because if the acceleration of gravity were different we wouldnt have evolved in such a way as to observe that value
674391 all things come to an end so now it seemed to be a good time i am a quiet person and wish to go back to my quiet life to my quiet readings and studies thank you ill continue visiting pf i enjoy greatly this place best wishes christine
674392 the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new
674393 thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others are not allowed to defend at all
674394 dark energy appears to be the dominant component of the physical universe yet there is no persuasive theoretical explanation for its existence or magnitude the acceleration of the universe is along with dark matter the observed phenomenon that most directly demonstrates that our theories of fundamental particles and gravity are either incorrect or incomplete most experts believe that nothing short of a revolution in our understanding of fundamental physics will be required to achieve a full understanding of the cosmic acceleration for these reasons the nature of dark energy ranks among the very most compelling of all outstanding problems in physical science these circumstances demand an ambitious observational program to determine the dark energy properties as well as possible
674395 yes these are issues that we should work on but not by calling others theories crackpotism or faith based science this is not constructive
674396 when you put this result for outward force into the geometry in the lower illustration above and allow for the effective outward force being e3 times stronger than the actual force on account of the higher density of the earlier universe since we are seeing and being affected by radiation from the past see calculations later on you get f gm 2 r 2 newtons if the shielding area is taken as the black hole area radius 2gm c 2
674397 up to this point the quantization of light energy which is the same as that in quantum electrodynamics has been derived directly from classical electromagnetic theory without any assumption of quantization this demonstrates that the quantization of energy is an intrinsic property of light as a classical electromagnetic wave and has no need of being related to particles
674398 i like feynmans argument very much although i have not thought about the virtual charges in the loops bit bit the general idea that you start with a double slit in a mask giving the usual interference by summingover the two paths then drill more slits and so more paths then just drill everything away leaving only the slits no mask great way of arriving at the path integral of qft
674399 i consider it quite possible that physics cannot be based on the field concept i e on continuous structures in that case nothing remains of my entire castle in the air gravitation theory included and of the rest of modern physics
674400 certainly dr greene has been been working for a long time 10 on a paradigm shift 10 towards which einstein struggled on his deathbed 30 for his effort his theory has no equations 10 and no tests 50 with the starting credit that much makes 105 points
674401 is dr greene a crackpot no but is this how physics should be presented to the public
674402 just because someone cleverer than me can use tensors analysis to do the above doesnt itself discredit intuitive physics
674403 why dont you follow the advice of baez above and try to learn it people who can do the tensor analysis of gr can do so because they decided to put in the time and effort to learn it and the prerequisites and they decided to learn it because probably they felt that they wanted to work with it something that you probably like as well
674404 but i do know the basics of general relativity and its solutions from a course on cosmology and also ive studied quite a bit more about it independently
674405 if you have got anything new in substance or in method and want to propagate it rapidly you need not expect anything but hindrance from the old practitioner even though he sat at the feet of faraday beetles could do that he is very disinclined to disturb his ancient prejudices but only give him plenty of rope and when the new views have become fashionably current he may find it worth his while to adopt them though perhaps in a somewhat sneaking manner not unmixed with bluster and make believe he knew all about it when he was a little boy
674406 its very clear that the photon and three ws feynman says that a neutral w is the z o are interconnected somehow but at the present level of understanding the connection is difficult to see clearly you can still see the
674407 richard feynman and others who developed the quantum theory of matter realized that empty space is filled with
674408 ill repeat that smolin and woit are not claiming that amss proof is insufficiently rigourous or that it has unfilled gaps in it theyre claiming that its not a proof at all
674409 proof n 1 the evidence or argument that compels the mind to accept an assertion as true
674410 2 a the validation of a proposition by application of specified rules as of induction or deduction to assumptions axioms and sequentially derived conclusions
674411 his argument asserting not only that string theory definitely failed but even that it caused the failure of physics and science as a whole
674412 i hope somebody beyond the line of duty will take the effort to look at them and tell you better on the record in a blog maybe here why they cant work
674413 they are claiming that string theory remains the most promising approach to a unified theory
674414 well it took more than 2000 years to get predictions out of the theory that there are atoms
674415 little black holes as dark matter candidates with feasible cosmic and terrestrial interactions
674416 a theory of quantum gravity may not be possible because quantum mechanics violates the equivalence principle
674417 a theory of quantum gravity may not be possible because quantum mechanics violates the equivalence principle
674418 we are thus left with the case of zero curvature or flat t space as the only one consistent with our fundamental principle and with conservation of mass
674419 now einsteins theory of gravitation is irreconcilable with the large numbers hypothesis
674420 as far as i am knowledgeable your graviton red shift concept is original and may even be right
674421 i think traditional qm would violate the ep regardless of whether gravitons have spin 1 or 2 i totally agree with those who think we need a theory of quantum gravity it is fundamental to the possibility of gravitational atoms and many macroscopic things like black holes and black hole radiation etc if done properly it may totally revolutionize our concept of time
674422 on a broader scale it appears that we live in a very special time in the history of the universe do you agree do you think this is just a coincidence or do you think there is a deeper reason for this
674423 if gravitons were causing gravity by hitting photons or rather the spacetime fabric which caused the deflection via either
674424 maxwells electromagnetic theory predicted an aether and maxwell wrote an article in encyclopedia britannica suggesting it could be checked by experimental observations of interference on light beamed in two directions and recombined
674425 but fitzgerald and lorentz tried to save the aether by adding the epicycle that objects such as the michelson morley instrument contract in the direction of motion thus allowing light to travel that way faster in the instrument and preventing interference while preserving aether
674426 einstein then reinterpreted this in 1905 preserving the contraction and the absence of experimental detection of uniform motion while dismissing the aether
674427 experimental results lead first to mainstream theories being fiddled to incorporate the new result
674428 the energy you get out of a moving object depends on the relative speed of the two objects
674429 within the context of egr the problem is more subtle than this ill hold to my statement that a time varying g violates conservation of energy and is antithetical to egr the non conservation of energy with a decreasing g is troublesome to me although energy is conserved globally energy is not conserved locally in einsteins general relativity because gravitational energy cannot be expressed in tensor form what do you think
674430 from yang mills quantum gravity arguments with gravity strength depending on the energy of exchanged gravitons the redshift of gravitons must stop gravitational retardation being effective so we must drop the effect of the term 0 5 hr 2 c
674431 however the friedmann universe solution of einsteins general relativity has m t
674432 when i said a decreasing g is troublesome to me i was referring to your idea that the gravitons from distant stars are redshifting to yield a smaller gravitational attraction i e a smaller effective g if i understood you in your letter of 12 30 6
674433 whats more the best fit behavior of the dark energy density seems to have it increasing with time as in phantom energy thats quite bizarre and unexpected
674434 reportedly the best bet for string theory his responses to class questions tend to be subtly hostile and do not provide much illumination
674435 jacques distler string theory i jacques distler is quite possibly the worst physics professor i have ever had he has the uncanny ability to make even the simplest concepts utterly incomprehensible he is a true intellectual snob and he treats most questions with open hostility unless you have a phd in math and already know string theory you will not learn anything from distler string theory is hard but not as hard as distler wants it to be
674436 our description of how the atomic nucleus holds together has up to now been entirely empirical arduous calculations starting from the theory of the strong nuclear force provide a new way into matters hard core
674437 also in nature is an interesting article by frank wilczek about recent lattice qcd results showing that qcd leads to a nucleon nucleon potential with hard core repulsion
674438 your argument that a displacement current is not required therefore it does not exist is non sequitur its like me saying i do not need a wheelchair therefore wheelchairs do not exist
674439 the electric field only exists around a charged particle if you measure an electric field then you have a charged particle close by if i am so wrong can you show me how to produce an electric field without using charged particles
674440 but there is not a snowballs chance in hell of getting the establishment or the wikipedia gestapo to even contemplate the idea of any link between magnetism and the coriolis force
674441 the main motivation for introducing susy is that it provides a natural resolution to the gauge hierarchy problem
674442 regarding your questions about vacuum polarization this is in fact what causes the gauge couplings to run with energy
674443 nigel i appreciate your enthusiam for thinking about these problems however it seems clear that you havent had any formal education on the subjects the bare mass and charges of the quarks and leptons are actually indeterminate at the level of quantum field theory when they are calculated you get an infinities what is done in renormalization is to simply replace the bare mass and charges with the finite measured values
674444 reports about a new gift card scam detailing how consumers could lose money from gift cards if criminals steal the card numbers from the back of the card are accurate but somewhat misleading

674464 the quantum collapse occurs when we model the wave moving according to schroedinger time dependent and then suddenly at the time of interaction we require it to be in an eigenstate and hence to also be a solution of schroedinger time independent the collapse of the wave function is due to a discontinuity in the equations used to model the physics it is not inherent in the physics
674465 conjecture the attractive gravitational mass of an object varies depending on the proximity of other matter in order to keep its total gravitational potential energy equal to its rest mass
674466 as the earths distance to the sun varies the strength of the earths gravity would vary over a year causing an annual 6cm variation of the moons orbit around the earth
674467 the shape of galactic rotation curves may be explained by the conjecture
674468 in this model not only is space expanding but the size of material objects is increasing too this expansion is called rescaling to emphasis that in this model all length dimensions increase uniformly i e the size of people atoms stars distance between all objects all these lengths increase uniformly according to dl l h dt giving l l o e ht
674469 for a mass as big as a galaxy equation e mc 2 mmg r should be amended to e mc 2 mmg r m 2 g r
674470 predicts a reduction in the effective gravitational constant for masses of high m r ratio
674471 for ordinary masses the m r ratio is insignificant compared to c 2 g but for galaxies it is significant
674472 so stars moving at a constant velocity at different radii means a constant m r ratio
674473 equation g c 2 m r m r predicts this constant ratio in the following way
674474 if m r is smaller than k for any given radius r then the effective gravitational constant is higher than average attracting more matter to within this radius increasing the m r ratio at this radius
674475 in this way a constant m r ratio for spiral galaxies can be maintained for different r resulting in the constant velocity of stars and the flat shape of the rotation graphs
674476 a reduction in the value of g at the centre of galaxies equation g c 2 m r m r may lead to the phenomenon of active galactic nuclei and the emergence of jets

674478 the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new
674479 this is an ongoing research program on a still rather underdeveloped theory how come you are willing to pre suppose the outcome and discard all the work that is going on to understand and better develop string theory in so many areas this is especially puzzling since you mention that lack of understanding how can you on the one hand claim that a theory is poorly understood and then in the same breath condemn it as unworkable before it is understood
674480 the total gravitational potential energy of the universe is on the order e mmg r mmg ct which when equated to e mc 2 gives louises equation
674481 we have gone over this already you are not applying the equations correctly the conclusions are incorrect due to a misapplication of physical law see my comments above i am turning comments off for this
674482 you are not defending science you are defending misguided and incompetently performed calculations which i cannot abide
674483 you are using the expression for rest mass that means literally mass at rest in some reference frame but you know that the early universe was radiative all particles were moving randomly and very close to the speed of light so almost all their energy was in the momentum p part of the full expression e sqrt p c 2 m c 2 2 because of the randomness there was no reference frame in which p 0
674484 gt the gravitational potential energy e mmg r m 2 g ct most quantities which you put in this expression are ill or un defined
674485 in general relativity which you must and claim to use in this context energy does not stand alone as a separately conserved quantity its just one component of the 4 4 energy momentum tensor
674486 your m is supposed to be the rest mass of the universe which is neither at rest nor to the best of our knowledge finite so you have an infinity squared there
674487 your r c t looks like it could be the hubble radius up to some factor of order unity e
674488 defined as the effective distance the majority of the mass would be moving if the universe collapsed
674489 so you are equating an incorrect expression for an ill defined e with an undefined quantity containing a square of an ill defined presumably infinite m divided by 0
674490 general relativity fully contains special relativity to do serious cosmology you need to solve the equations of general relativity you are not doing that
674491 again ill defined but lets say you take the standard frw solutions of einsteins equations put yourself in the comoving frame and compute the gravitational potential of a test particle according to your prescription since the frw solutions are isotropic your result will 0 so now youre saying that taking the square of an ill defined presumably infinite m and dividing by 0 yields 0
674492 because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the laws on their side and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans whilst the others defend lukewarmly in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them
674493 my way of looking at things was completely new and i could not deduce it from other known mathematical schemes but i knew what i had done was right

674580 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
674581 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
674582 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
674583 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

674603 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
674604 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
674605 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts

674628 all in all the gulf of maine is doing pretty well at this point in our history we are doing things in virtually every spot in the ocean in the gulf of maine someone is fishing someone is traveling someone is trying to lay a cable or a pipeline or is transporting oil or is discharging ballast from a ship or wants to mine gravel or wants to grow salmon or mussels
674629 the question is whats the right amount and where and how
674630 right now oil companies are sitting on 68 million acres an area approximately three times the size of maine
674631 they need to drill on land they already control oil and gas development in the gulf of maine would threaten maines thriving coastal economy and rich fishing heritage
674632 we need to produce more use less and pursue alternatives
674633 unless theres someplace in the law that would allow them to do that that i dont know about it would appear that they have violated the law

674636 it says in our regulations that we are to use currently accepted and technically valid knowledge
674637 as a question of good government the citizen ought to be able to read the rule and have it mean what it means on its face if it becomes outdated it should be changed

674639 im being challenged by all the reports the telephone calls and other things that came in reaction to this that there are other points of view

674654 in the scottish parliament the political parties are operating mini party headquarters
674655 despite each party having their own privately well funded offices across scotland many workers paid by the parties freely carry out political work in our parliament with the blatant use of publicly funded parliamentary facilities
674656 since 1999 there has been a creeping trend towards discreet party exploitation of public money
674657 as we speak party workers will be sitting in our parliament using taxpayers money to write party manifestos deal with enquiries about other politicians and political activities work on election propaganda and draft party conference material
674658 should the public really be forced to prop up the financial failings of political parties this is surely an inappropriate use of public money and i have written to the parliamentary authorities and to the standards commissioner to urge them to investigate these dubious practices and take action where appropriate the politicians must stop abusing our trust and state clearly at what point legitimate parliamentary activity begins and party politics ends

674677 when you live in an area thats heavily populated by theists its understandable that one would feel some social and psychological pressures from that community this can lead to feelings of inadequacy loneliness isolation and even embarrassment when one is feeling judged or ridiculed

674681 that was the most amazing sex ive ever had is there a name for that type of sex
674682 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
674683 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
674684 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
674685 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
674686 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
674687 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
674688 with creativity and political will the progress and individualized approach to antiretroviral therapy evident in the developed world can be adapted to the public health approach in the developing world where 90 percent of the worlds hiv infected population lives
674689 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
674690 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
674691 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive

674875 there have been reports in kent of people waking up and finding their lawns covered in dead frogs
674876 the number of victims is often way in excess of what people thought were in their gardens the virus was introduced most likely by people getting rid of exotic amphibian pets which then in turn infected the local population
674877 i would urge people not to dump their unwanted pets in the countryside or even domestic ponds for that matter
674878 it can have a serious effect on the amphibians already living there and close by
674879 we are losing literally thousands of frogs and toads a year to these two diseases
674880 now we need people across kent and the rest of the country to check on their frogs and toads and report back seeing dead ones particularly if they appear to have skin problems it can be very obvious that a frog was sick before it died i would also urge that these two diseases have no effect on humans
674881 amphibians are being devastated by disease on a global scale but we have only an extremely limited picture of what is going on in our own backyard
674882 there is a whole range of reasons why dead amphibians turn up in gardens and many of these are completely normal events
674883 however during the humid summer months we hear numerous reports of unusual frog deaths in gardens

674890 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
674891 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
674892 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
674893 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
674894 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
674895 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
674896 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
674897 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
674898 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
674899 im very happy there have been various incidents this season that have happened when ive been in a position to fight for a victory
674900 the team have kept pushing and im very glad to get this first win
674901 its fantastic a great moment something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this is the first of many
674902 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go and i was p2 so this is remarkable after the race in hockenheim and the big crash
674903 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
674904 today sunday was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
674905 that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right and left as before because we have one striker and that is anelka
674906 maybe i will receive good news about drogba and we have 12 days to train and maybe we will have something i dont expect
674907 we need to be careful in the way we make our argument that we dont do things that inadvertently stop there being a good platform for labours case to come across
674908 the labour party is clearly split right down the middle with some people backing brown and others trying to knife him
674909 what we have is a government in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges we simply cant go on like this for another 18 months we need a general election sooner rather than later
674910 we come across many unique and important items of memorabilia but few stir the emotions like jack dyers no 17 jumper
674911 weve spent the day on the phone talking to our family in ireland and obviously our parents are devastated
674912 but we have been heartened and are grateful to so many strangers and friends in melbourne who have been helping us through this ordeal
674913 we cant believe the kindness we have been shown by so many people who have expressed concern for stephen
674914 if rates are cut and cut substantially prices are not going to go down
674915 we think we are at the peak in terms of interest rates
674916 some people think theyre boring animals or nasty but theyre actually really nice and they have their own personalities
674917 we took our one little bale of hay around and he saw there were 70 donkeys in the big barn
674918 judicial discretion is a cornerstone of our justice system but so is consistency transparency fairness and certainty these laws dont undermine the legal principles judges are required to follow in sentencing they merely require judges to be quite clear about what theyre doing
674919 i can say a plea of guilty has a mitigatory effect on sentence and can say it would have been a longer one but thats all i can sensibly say
674920 some of them just cant come to grips with the idea of someone telling them what to do or that the public is entitled to know exactly how they reach their decisions
674921 we are not sure yet of the final specification of the car but this system looks very interesting
674922 the human brain is still the most complex computer in the world
674923 the brumby government has implemented a broad range of measures designed to combat alcohol related harm ranging from giving police and the director of liquor licensing more powers putting a freeze on any new late night liquor licences and providing more support to victorians experiencing problems with alcohol
674924 the current lockout trial will cease at the start of september an evaluation of its effectiveness will be completed the temporary lockout will cease before any future on going arrangements are put in place
674925 people will get killed definitely weve got a crisis on our hands its a risk every night i am very very concerned
674926 this is a complex social issue and as a government we are working to combat alcohol related harm right across the victorian community
674927 well gee lets just look at my options shall we one totally hot big headed moron whos a complete idiot and who managed to get me killed or the goofy sweet pseudo evil maniac who provided captain screw loose with the means of my death and then used my impaling as a means to join the evil league of evil or door number three
674928 yes on one condition you have to make all this singing stop
674929 of course i like singing this whole musical thing was kind of neat but so help me god if i hear captain hammer sing about putting a condom on his hammer of love ever again i wont be responsible for my actions

674934 my father started beating me when i was four years old
674935 at least i think thats when he started it couldve been earlier but i cant remember that far back
674936 he was a very angry man and he would hit me any time something went wrong in his life
674937 my mom had been sick for a long time and everyone kept saying it was just a matter of time i was nine the summer that she died and my dad went on a drinking binge that lasted a more than a month i spent all that time at my friend bobbys house and my dad didnt even notice that i was gone i missed my mom but just being away from my dad made it easier to deal with the hurt
674938 uh um well yeah i guess you can say i did
674939 my friend bobby he had the kind of childhood every kid dreams of his mom stayed home and made cookies for us his dad took him on fishing trips and taught him to ride his bike
674940 they were hispanic and my dad would always talk about them as if they were second rate yet every night i would ask god to tell bobbys parents to adopt me
674941 so my mother died and my father was piss drunk for a month
674942 bobbys parents took me in while we waited for my dad to sober up i guess god kinda answered my prayer because for that entire month i got to live like i was their kid
674943 its a small town about thirty minutes south of the texas border bobbys dad was from estrella and they had a small house there we spent two weeks that summer at their house swimming in the river chasing chickens in the patio and riding our bikes around the town
674944 all right then lets go we need to beat the tourists to the border or well be stuck there forever
674945 well if im going to tell you my story i might as well start from the beginning
674946 dzanga sangha nature reserve jewel in the heart of africa
674947 have you ever been in a relationship where there are so many problems that you should just break up but its something you just cant let go
674948 but i think its better if we go back to being best friends
674949 ah i see why you dont want to talk about work
674950 i mean that you dont want me to talk about all the things i do as a soloist
674951 i always thought tsunku should get you out of that group and turn you solo
674952 how is it possible to sell donate and throw something away
674953 four people were killed and nine others were injured after a crude bomb exploded in garbage dump the incident happened when some ragpickers went to collect plastic pouches from the dump
674954 as they were scourging through the dumping ground they found the bomb and ignorantly tried to break it and that caused the explosion
674955 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate
674956 hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
674957 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
674958 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
674959 i know what hes been going through its a wonderful job but its also a job that becomes all consuming he said hes not been himself at home and wanted to get back to being me
674960 the job gets on top of you its a great job but youre thinking about it all the time
674961 the pressure eventually bears down on you and if youre not getting runs as well then it becomes very difficult
674962 but he wouldnt have liked to make it a difficult choice for the selectors if he hadnt got runs at the oval
674963 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
674964 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
674965 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
674966 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
674967 he was going to go out in a blaze of glory that he was going to take everybody out with him
674968 to now be able to prosecute him for the murders
674969 as far back as the year 2000 the respondent has actually attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer when he feels that hes been slighted or has had especially toward women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings
674970 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
674971 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him
674972 decreasing the number of students in a classroom increases test scores by 20
674973 in classrooms with less amount of students achievement levels where higher than in classrooms with a higher number of students
674974 the investigating agencies did not do their job so we inquired into the matter and gathered documentary evidence in the case
674975 the student identified as rituraj dixit 14 admitted of killing ram krishna yadav and vedant manmodhe in the hostels bathroom
674976 ram was killed on july 29 while vedant was murdered on july 31 by rituraj who after calling the minors to the toilet on the pretext of giving them chocolates took their lives by gagging them
674977 the armed forces are deployed at the border and it is there they have to have such powers without which they cannot do their job
674978 there has been 40 per cent improvement on the ground level situation
674979 the person who indulges in crime needs to be punished you cannot kill another innocent person in place of the actual culprit
674980 we are here to hear tehrans views on the issue and see if we can play any role in this regard
674981 i was briefed on the details of irans nuclear program during my meetings with senior iranian officials
674982 we are serious about holding talks we seek negotiations based on legal principles leading to practical outcomes
674983 we hope that others will be ready to discuss different regional and international issues and move towards peace and security
674984 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
674985 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now
674986 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
674987 has relied repeatedly on the enforceability of this and other treaty obligations abroad
674988 if we do not keep our promises to our international partners we lose the ability to protect our own citizens abroad and damage our nations reputation as a reliable player on the world stage
674989 committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner
674990 shall be exercised in conformity with the laws and regulations
674991 subject to the proviso however that the said laws must enable full effect to be given to the purposes
674992 the world court has no standing in texas and texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court
674993 it is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties its very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens
674994 perhaps hemlock is the answer for all the bleeding hearts who completely forget about the victims and their suffering
674995 and we should worry that these horses patoots should have a bit of pain awareness of anything give me a break
674996 ordinarily used to render a surgical patient unconscious for mere minutes only in the induction phase of anesthesia specifically so that the patient may reawaken and breathe on his own power if any complications arise
674997 suffocate to death while experiencing an intense conscious desire to inhale
674998 injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death
674999 torture or ill treatment or unnecessary pain should be inflicted
675000 the written protocol is effectively irrelevant to the reality of how texas carries out execution by lethal injection in practice
675001 demonstrates that the tdcjs assertions that the protocol is applied in texas just as it is in kentucky are unsupported allegations and in large measure simply false
675002 materially indistinguishable from texas protocol chis eighth amend ment claim has no merit
675003 apparently the court will not tolerate actual litigation of the issue if it means the death machine meanwhile must stand idle
675004 but we cannot fix the machine while the cogs are turning
675005 a sentencing statute must not only narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty it must also ensure sentencing decisions are based upon an individual inquiry
675006 the texas capital murder scheme does not allow an individual to be put to death merely for being a party because the law of parties cannot be applied in answering the special issues
675007 i believe the right and just decision is to commute fosters sentence
675008 there will be a full package going to the governor and i think you will see a lot of similarities between us and foster
675009 jeff was just dumb hes so trusting of people and has to get burned in order to learn a lesson

675016 this article may require cleanup to meet wikipedias quality standards
675017 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
675018 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
675019 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
675020 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us
675021 but i know that they were relentless relentless both domestically and overseas both with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
675022 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation

675031 ik denk dat er toch zon 5 000 mensen naar doel gekomen zijn
675032 de sympathie met het dorp is zeer groot vooral de beelden op televisie van mooie huizen die afgebroken werden heeft veel mensen geraakt
675033 dat ons dorp er verloederd bijligt is de schuld van de overheid die perfect bewoonbare huizen sloopt en van doel een ge soleerd getto wil maken

675074 regardless of what jersey im wearing its the same game ive played my entire life
675075 i still believe that it comes down to our pitching
675076 weve got to pitch the ball well and play good defense were going to have days like this we havent had one in quite a while
675077 feldman goes out there and pitches his tail off its frustrating to see him pitch that well and then lose the game its my fault that we lost that game
675078 hopefully i can go out and relax like i did against the mariners and keep us in the games
675079 i dont care how many griffeys we bring in here weve got to start pitching better you got to go out there and do it
675080 ive been doing that a lot lately more than usual
675081 its exciting and ill have time to enjoy personal accolades in the offseason but what were doing right now as a team is a little more exciting
675082 finally we put up a big number for the pitching staff and i think they needed that mentally from grinding it out
675083 everybody knows we havent been hitting with runners in scoring position with nobody out or two outs
675084 we just havent done the job youve got to go out and win ballgames
675085 weve hung around 500 and got a little over we just havent been able to take the next step to get something really rolling
675086 thats the best feeling in baseball is when you get a pitch and you hit it well and you know its gone

675124 he was pitching really really well until the sixth inning his pitch count was down at 75 pitches then it just started piling up on him
675125 i just want to be able to keep us in games
675126 if you dont think you can do it you shouldnt be here thats for sure
675127 it was a fun situation to be in and im happy i got the opportunity
675128 unfortunately this game they judge you for that they criticize winning or losing a game
675129 thats the way it goes it happened in the past and theres nothing i can really do
675130 quite frankly i was lucky to not give up nine runs with what i had going on
675131 against any team any good team if youre aggressive and youre ahead in the count and you go out there and dont try to do too much just trying to do your job things can happen when you hit the spots
675132 its important to stop that kind of momentum when we get into a little rut
675133 hes proven it hes just had a tough time this year it was nice to see him win monday night thats what weve been looking for hopefully its a turning point

675136 we just have to play better everybody has to play better myself included
675137 i didnt care if i gave up 15 runs i wanted to get a win
675138 i just live day by day pitch by pitch sometimes theyre going to get me sometimes im going to get them thats part of the game im not trying to hit home runs i just want to make good contact
675139 i was trying to challenge the hitters i was just thinking throw strikes and let them hit it thats what i was thinking the whole game
675140 you grew up playing here in front of your family and friends

675145 but theyve had faith in me all along and i knew i could do it

675151 the christian church builds their beautiful cathedrals in the form of a cross because of their love of that symbol which is at the heart of their values and ideals

675174 debe ser una persona independiente con mucha autoridad moral con mucha fuerza para actuar que no se case con nadie eso es lo que necesitamos y eso es lo que el per espera nosotros necesitamos un contralor y no un opositor

675181 wir haben wichtige punkte geholt aber es war sogar ein podium drin
675182 wir haben hart gek mpft und die pace war da das ist ermutigend f r den rest der saison
675183 leider habe ich einen kleinen fehler auf der ersten runde gemacht wodurch ich zwei pl tze verloren habe
675184 wir waren im qualifying nicht gut genug das hat uns im rennen benachteiligt
675185 wir fanden keine pace und es war schwierig mit den toyota und renault mitzuhalten gegen die wir in der wm k mpfen
675186 ich hatte einige probleme und kimi schloss zu mir auf
675187 aber ich wusste aus dem letzten jahr in der gp2 als ich selbst mit einem schnellen auto im mittelfeld fest hing dass es schwierig ist zu berholen
675188 meine erste runde war nicht so toll ich war in der falschen position und habe einige pl tze verloren dann lief beim ersten stopp etwas mit der tankanlage schief was einige zeit gekostet hat und mich hinter giancarlo fisichella zur ckwarf damit war die strategie zerst rt
675189 ich hatte einen schlechten start der mich auf platz 14 zur ckgeworfen hat nach kurve eins war heidfeld innen von mir ich wusste dass er sich verbremsen wird und so geschah es auch ich musste selbst meine linie ndern dadurch kam rubens an mir vorbei den ich aber nachher wieder berholen konnte
675190 zwischenzeitlich lief ich wieder auf heidfeld auf er war in den letzten beiden kurven immer sehr stark ich hatte keine chance zu berholen das problem war dass er eine ein stopp strategie hatte und somit nicht in die box fuhr
675191 nach einem guten start mit vier gewonnenen position war es kein sonderlich aufregendes rennen f r mich wir entschieden uns mit gebrauchten vorderreifen zu starten das war ein fehler denn das auto hatte auf dem ersten stint keine gute balance
675192 dann hat die tankanlage beim ersten stopp ein kleines feuer verursacht und es dauerte lange bis die zweite tankanlage bereit war danach war mein rennen im grunde schon vorbei
675193 die zahlreichen blauen flaggen die mir gezeigt wurden haben es unm glich gemacht noch boden gutzumachen ein rennen zum vergessen

675306 he opened the door a little and i was able to stick my nose in there and get past
675307 ultimately i felt inspired by him and i dont think anyone in our generation has had that experience
675308 it comes down to a simple choice for all of us if you like the direction the country is going you should vote for mccain but if you want a candidate who rejects those policies but has a vision then obamas your guy
675309 bn has denied our rights thats why we support the opposition but even they dont move in the exact direction we want at the stroke of a pen pakatan led governments can give us fully aided tamil schools ideological coordinator w sambulingam said in his speech
675310 right now its only one here and one there tell us what the plan is and how it will be executed if you can allocate 130 hectares for pig farms in selangor i am sure something can be done for tamil schools
675311 we are not supporting pakatan rakyat to gain political positions but because they have promised a free society and we have faith in their promise
675312 we recognise that any government needs to be pressured and lobbied to give the people what they want and this can only be effective when society and media is free and oppressive laws are abolished
675313 dont forget that the idea of hindraf is for your rights
675314 tamil school headmasters have refused to meet with opposition figures and cited an education ministry order i personally had to leave a parent teacher association meeting in kulim before the headmaster would attend
675315 samys attempt to mediate for the release of the hindraf 5 is a direct contradiction to what he said prior to the elections when he supported the arrests
675316 as far as hindraf is concerned we have no faith in mics race based struggle and we dont take samy seriously we ourselves are an offshoot of police watch and we were formed to fill the void because no one was fighting for indians
675317 we are not against the yang di pertuan agong or the country we are simply against the government that denies us our rights so with merdeka coming soon we want to launch our own campaign
675318 were not taking things lightly if umno and barisan nasional decide to go rough with bribery then we have to be prepared

675329 creemos que son los padres los que tienen que elegir la ense anza que quieren para sus hijos la constituci n garantiza que todos los espa oles tienen el deber de conocer el castellano y en ese sentido va la propuesta que ha hecho el pp

675333 poniendo m s trabas para que el castellano se utilice en una comunidad aut noma y haya igualdad de derechos entre los ciudadanos
675334 ah el presidente del gobierno tiene una grave responsabilidad porque zapatero ten a la obligaci n de posibilitar que todos los padres y todos los ni os puedan aprender el castellano en los colegios catalanes
675335 el deber de todos los espa oles de conocer el castellano

675340 i invested in maika holdings i lost a lot of money
675341 remember nov 25 last year the hindraf rally near klcc i was there
675342 i surveyed first i attended its ceramahs and listened to the leaders talk i found what they said to be good so after so many months i decided to join
675343 the number 2 man in the chambers is the solicitor general therefore he will handle the matter
675344 there are several leaders in umno who are qualified to take over from abdullah leaders who are not influenced by the greed of their families leaders who are willing to make sacrifices in order to restore pre eminent position of umno within the barisan nasional
675345 one of them could be rais yatim maybe in the end it would be tengku razaleigh hamzah with rais as deputy
675346 and the opposition openly declare they want abdullah to go on leading simply because he is weak a kind of backhanded compliment to become strong he might want to embrace pas as a coalition partner then he would have his two third majority
675347 to do this he will have to offer his sweeteners his usual solution to all problems maybe he would offer a second deputy prime minister to pas president datuk seri abdul hadi awang and ministership to some other pas leaders
675348 by associating with datuk seri abdullah accepting the sweets and soft pedalling pass islamic state raison detre pas is likely to lose support
675349 three weeks ago i promised to bring it down to 50 sen but now because of the drop in oil prices we can reduce it by 70 sen
675350 our roads schools and reach of electricity and telephony are not the same as norways we have to use petronas revenue for serious developments why is it malaysia doesnt have a trust fund
675351 we spend to build schools roads combat urban poverty were a developing country not a developed country like norway and we need to do short term development
675352 until there is viable public transport system raising fuel prices is unjustifiable
675353 the government is looking into setting up a regulatory body instead of having public transport overseen by different ministries and city councils like dbkl then it can divvy up profitable and non profitable routes among operators if not certain routes wont be serviced
675354 it would make companies think i had better not be so productive or the government will tax me
675355 we would give 100 per cent support to anwar wherever he may contest to ensure that he could take his rightful place in parliament
675356 its a little known fact that after invading iraq in 2003 the u s found massive amounts of uranium yellowcake the stuff that can be refined into nuclear weapons or nuclear fuel at a facility in tuwaitha outside of baghdad in recent weeks the u s secretly has helped the iraqi government ship it all to canada where it was bought by a canadian company for further processing into nuclear fuel thus keeping it from potential use by terrorists or unsavory regimes in the region this has been virtually ignored by the mainstream media yet as the ap reported this marks a significant step toward closing the books on saddams nuclear legacy seems to us this should be big news
675357 there was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 said
675358 hell be suspended for the first two regular season games
675359 what he did was wrong we take it very serious and hes being punished severely for it
675360 its something thats inexcusable and thats the punishment its a pretty steep severe punishment
675361 hes doing fine hes in great mental spirits which is critical physically it could have been worse not that a broken nose is not bad enough well treat it as we go
675362 this matter is being handled the copied article has been deleted form our site and we are taking steps to ensure this doesnt happen again

675367 i feel a little bit sorry for felipe and lewis because they both drove a great race
675368 i know how they feel what happened to them today i have had similar moments this year quite a few times
675369 there have been various incidents earlier this year when have been in position on saturday to fight for victory and always something has gone wrong or things havent functioned perfectly
675370 today massa and lewis were both very fast at beginning of race
675371 but half way through my car was starting to work better and then at the end i tried to put pressure on felipe to push him as hard as possible because you never know what might happen
675372 when i saw the car on fire on the main straight with big smoke i thought it must be felipe but it was hard to believe and after that there was no big pressure of course and i just had to bring it home
675373 of course it is a great moment and one i have been targeting for many many years since i wanted to become an f1 driver
675374 ive spent a lot of time to achieve this goal so to finally achieve it is very pleasing and hopefully this is the first of many
675375 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine going off and i was p2
675376 after hockenheim where we had a good race pace and then the big crash we came to budapest and just kept the speed here and had a really good car from friday onwards
675377 we never did a really big change on the car and it was just perfect until the last stint with the soft tyres which was a bit tricky
675378 unbelievable in my first year half of the season over and im on the podium
675379 i was under pressure from kimi and with the soft tyres at the end i was struggling quite a lot
675380 we knew already since friday that the soft tyres would be difficult
675381 when i saw i was nine seconds in front of kimi i had a reasonable pace but the team told me he was nearly a second quicker per lap
675382 i just tried to push more and more and i just destroyed the tyres every time
675383 so i had to really focus on keeping it cool and not pay too much attention to kimi
675384 last year in gp2 i was stuck in the middle of the field here we had a really quick car but we couldnt get past anyone in formula 1 its even more difficult
675385 when he got close to me i could see in the mirrors that for two laps he couldnt catch me up any more so i thought ok dont make any mistakes keep it on the track and thats what i did
675386 i had to improve a little bit in terms of the starts
675387 my reaction time was not perfect in the first couple of races but i just improved myself
675388 i think the start time today was really really good and i could out accelerate robert

675442 i think of an epidemic like hiv or i think of the collapse of a social system like in the former soviet union
675443 but people at the top in some other countries live a lot longer
675444 what kind of society do we want to live in
675445 the penthouse has gotten really really nice all sorts of new gadgets have been put in the units just below the penthouse have also improved a lot the units in the middle have stayed about the same the basement apartment used to be ok but now its gotten infested with cockroaches and its been flooding
675446 a house may be large or small as long as the neighboring houses are likewise small it satisfies all social requirement for a residence but let there arise next to the little house a palace and the little house shrinks to a hut
675447 but once it was adopted it was politically impossible to change it
675448 going to movies eating out at restaurants going on occasional vacations having internet access and a cell phone none of these things are in the federal poverty level
675449 what matters for functioning in society is what the average person is able to do
675450 the japanese have a very strong culture against conspicuous displays of affluence
675451 when i was a child growing up in suburban tokyo it was very difficult to distinguish by dress or anything else rich kids from poor kids whereas in america bring it on
675452 its pretty clear that an egalitarian ethos runs along with the idea of having strong safety nets and protecting the health of the most vulnerable
675453 the founding fathers didnt want the government to do that much
675454 is still the same document approved by a minority of wealthy white men in 1776
675455 should not be completely free and happy the fault will be intirely their own
675456 a course should assess the role of optimism and opportunity in a land of work the belief that energy initiative and inventiveness will continue to provide a promising future
675457 the highest levels of inequality are found in the new world and not the old for reasons we dont understand
675458 these are societies built on conquest many of them on slavery
675459 a lot of the inequality may just be the legacy of those things
675460 in a world in which each individual is looking out for themselves players will tend to concentrate on improving their own performance to the exclusion of team goals since their own performance is what matters for moving up the pay scale
675461 concentrating on trying to hit more home runs or improving ones own hitting average are not necessarily the tactics that lift team performance as opposed to say practicing great defense
675462 in most of americas larger cities new york city detroit chicago milwaukee the segregation index was over 80
675463 great gaps between rich and poor may hurt democracy and rule of law if elites prefer dictators who will protect their interests or if the disadvantaged turn to a dictator who promises to ignore property rights
675464 would be a system where you have a really broad base of contributors that are contributing relatively small amounts you want parties to be responsive to voters donations are a way in which parties are made responsive to voters
675465 can decline to a point where youre no longer able to participate meaningfully in society
675466 if people are worried about their basic needs of survival and security and food and shelter
675467 they cannot worry about the fact that a cigarette which is providing relief from stress now is going to cause lung cancer 20 years from now if you can address the basic needs so people are no longer worried about them you free them to consider those larger higher level needs that have long term consequences for their well being
675468 when people live in areas where there arent supermarkets that sell fresh fruits and vegetables their intake of fresh fruits and vegetables is dramatically lower
675469 if people live in areas where there arent sidewalks where there arent safe bike paths and places to walk and playgrounds or where the rate of crime is so high that its not safe to go outside then their level of exercise is much lower and their rates of obesity are higher
675470 is that if people move to a new neighborhood theyre automatically going to do better well in fact a lot of this is about connecting people to resources
675471 people may be used to doing their shopping at a convenience store or a liquor store
675472 they may not be used to the idea of exercising outside if they came from a neighborhood that was not safe
675473 but no democratic society is entirely comfortable with this fact
675474 the american poor seem to be much more trapped than their european counterparts
675475 if you had made people borrow money to go to high school in the early twentieth century
675476 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests

675483 the fifth and sixth have kind of been our innings
675484 we were a little frustrated especially after getting no hit through five
675485 for the most part it usually coincides with the second or third time through the order
675486 i broke it out for the first time all year

675490 it all started with me walking span in the seventh its one of those things i dont have a reason for it i just couldnt make the pitches i wasnt trying extra hard and i wasnt distracted by the break in the game

675498 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
675499 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
675500 with creativity and political will the progress and individualized approach to antiretroviral therapy evident in the developed world can be adapted to the public health approach in the developing world where 90 percent of the worlds hiv infected population lives
675501 this study tells us that a rationally dosed growth hormone regimen does a pretty good job of improving several risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients who develop this syndrome while taking antiretroviral drugs but growth hormone therapy may be limited by its effects on glucose levels
675502 low dose growth hormone may be an effective and safe treatment for those whose glucose tolerance is normal and not for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
675503 in an earlier study our group showed that treatment with a drug that induces the release of growth hormone significantly decreases abdominal fat without increasing glucose levels more work needs to be done to determine which strategy is appropriate for particular patients as well as clarifying the role of lifestyle changes and eventually identifying new antiretroviral drugs that do not cause these metabolic abnormalities
675504 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
675505 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
675506 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
675507 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
675508 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive
675509 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
675510 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting

675512 der immer wieder einsetzende und teils starke nieselregen hat es f r alle sehr schwierig gemacht umso erfreulicher ist die tatsache dass dem gesamten team kein einziger fehler unterlief das war letztendlich der entscheidende faktor f r den erneuten erfolg ich kann noch gar nicht glauben hier schon wieder gewonnen zu haben
675513 timo hatte trotz der tank probleme ein bilderbuchrennen er war extrem schnell und er ist zeiten gefahren fast wie die f hrenden f r timo glock und toyota war das ein starkes rennen
675514 man darf die leistung nicht so schlecht einstufen f nfter platz heute so wird man meister man muss punkten auch bei schlechten rennen heute hat er pech gehabt und hat trotzdem gut gepunktet
675515 es hatte einen guten start und dann hatte ich im qualifying ein paar probleme auch das rennen begann ganz gut denn ich hatte eine gute geschwindigkeit dann ging beim ersten boxenstopp alles zum teufel da die jungs den feuerl scher benutzen mussten und ich eine menge schaum in mein visier bekam
675516 diesmal hatte ich schaum im inneren und au en an meinem visier konnte nichts sehen
675517 dies passierte beim zweiten boxenstopp erneut und diesmal hatte ich schaum im inneren und au en an meinem visier konnte nichts sehen und musste erneut an die box kommen um es gereinigt zu bekommen da hatte ich bereits so viel zeit verloren dass ich nichts mehr tun konnte und ich es vorzog einen zus tzlichen stopp einzulegen da die mangelnde sicht gef hrlich war
675518 ich hatte keinen sehr guten boxenstopp und das sorgte daf r dass der motor berhitzte
675519 dies zerst rte ein paar teile und ich hatte keine andere wahl als auszuscheiden das ist eine schande denn ich hatte heute nachmittag eine gute geschwindigkeit
675520 ich machte einen fehler als ich in der letzten kurve in der ersten runde neben die strecke kam und verlor eine menge pl tze ich hing hinter barrichello fest und war nicht in der lage zu berholen dies war kein gutes wochenende und dies begann schon am freitag als ich probleme mit der zuverl ssigkeit hatte und gipfelte dann in der entt uschung an diesem nachmittag
675521 dies war f r das gesamte team ein schlechtes wochenende es scheint als w re budapest nicht vettels ort da wir am freitag technische probleme hatten und sich dies im rennen fortsetzte da wir aufgeben mussten im moment sind wir uns nicht ganz sicher was das problem war aber wir gehen davon aus dass es durch berhitzung zustandekam
675522 was bourdais betrifft so absolvierte er einen guten start kam von platz 19 in der startaufstellung bis auf rang 16 nach vorn bei seinem ersten boxenstopp in runde 32 hatten wir ein problem mit dem benzin system das feuer fing gl cklicherweise wurde es rechtzeitig gel scht aber das problem trat beim zweiten stopp wieder auf
675523 dieser eine punkt ist okay denn unsere pace war sehr langsam und ich hatte gro e schwierigkeiten damit das auto auf der strecke zu halten
675524 keine traktion auf der hinterachse keine stabilit t beim bremsen das heck ist einfach zu sehr gerutscht
675525 ja das qualifying war so etwas wie ein wunder aber heute konnte ich diese leistung nicht mehr abrufen das war schlicht nicht m glich man konnte deutlich sehen dass ich in den anfangsrunden die pace von timo noch mitgehen konnte solange die reifen noch okay waren als die reifen aber an grip verloren da war das auto im nirgendwo schon gestern war das auto schwierig zu fahren wir m ssen das in ruhe analysieren und schauen wo der fehler lag
675526 liegt das an einem bestimmten entwicklungsschritt oder h lst du das f r ein streckenspezifisches problem
675527 um ehrlich zu sein habe ich diese art von schwierigkeiten nicht erwartet wir hatten zwar graining erwartet aber nicht dass die reifen schon auf der outlap hin ber gehen w rden das heck war einfach zu nerv s sogar auf der installationsrunde am freitag hatte ich eine bessere traktion als heute das ist also gewiss nicht normal wir m ssen einfach verstehen was da los war unsere rundenzeiten bauen rapide ab wir sind da scheinbar anf llig
675528 nein so ist es auch wieder nicht aber ich h pfe oft ins auto und habe guten grip doch pl tzlich ist eine session sp ter alles ganz anders man kann nat rlich anf hren dass sich die strecke und die bedingungen ver ndern die heutige pace war aber eine der schlechtesten in meiner formel 1 karriere wenn nicht sogar die schlechteste berhaupt
675529 begann das schon in runde eins oder hat sich das entwickelt
675530 ich konnte es nicht glauben als ich felipes motor kaputtgehen sah
675531 ich konnte es nicht glauben als ich felipes motor kaputtgehen sah und ich auf der zweiten position lag ein solches ergebnis in meinem ersten jahr zu holen ist fantastisch also ein gro es dankesch n an alle im team inklusive an die ingenieure mechaniker und alle in der fabrik
675532 ich wusste schon vom qualifying dass wir eine gute geschwindigkeit haben und wir sahen das ganze wochenende ber stark aus heute legte ich einen guten start hin und machte in die erste kurve hinein einen platz gut ich hatte ein wirklich gutes auto und alles lief bis zum letzten abschnitt des rennens auf weichen reifen gut ich k mpfte eine menge und schon bald hatte ich kimi hinter mir
675533 als ich ihn in den spiegeln sah da wusste ich dass ich mir keinerlei fehler erlauben darf
675534 ich wusste jedoch aus dem vergangenen jahr hier in der gp2 als ich mit einem wirklich guten auto im mittelfeld hing wie schwierig es ist hier zu berholen als ich ihn in den spiegeln sah da wusste ich dass ich mir keinerlei fehler erlauben darf dieses ergebnis macht hockenheim mehr als nur gut nun m ssen wir weiterhin regelm ig bis zum ende der saison punkte holen
675535 dies ist f r uns ein sehr gutes ergebnis und es ist gro artig f r die konstrukteurswertung zehn punkte zu holen
675536 ich bin f r timo froh denn er hatte ein sehr gutes wochenende und verdient dieses ergebnis absolut es h tte auch f r mich besser laufen k nnen trotz meiner probleme im qualifying ich war heute schnell aber ich konnte keinen druck machen da ich den ganzen nachmittag ber nur eine runde hatte die frei von verkehr war
675537 ich machte fr h eine position gut aber das berholen ist hier praktisch unm glich rund um den zweiten stopp hing ich zudem hinter lewis fest was mich weiter aufhielt dennoch bin ich erleichtert dass wir eine solch starke form zeigen ich hoffe einfach dass wir weiterhin in guter form weiter machen k nnen und solch gute ergebnisse erzielen
675538 ich kann wirklich keine worte finden um dieses ergebnis zu feiern
675539 ich kann wirklich keine worte finden um dieses ergebnis zu feiern das beste unserer saison
675540 wir hatten im training ein paar schwierigkeiten aber w hrend des qualifyings haben sich die fahrer selbst an das limit gebracht und die dinge liefen besser und besser
675541 heute fuhr timo ein fantastisches rennen wir haben sofort gesehen dass sein auto schnell war und sein dritter rennabschnitt war beinahe perfekt er stand unter druck von kimi aber er war im dritten sektor schnell und er war in der lage sich gegen ihn zu verteidigen
675542 auch jarno war schnell und machte intensiv druck aber er wurde f r den gro teil des rennens blockiert und konnte seine geschwindigkeit lediglich im letzten abschnitt kurz zeigen
675543 das auto lief einfach perfekt aber nach der h lfte der ersten saison schon aufs podium zu fahren ist einfach super
675544 er hat platz zwei souver n gegen kimi heimgefahren und damit bewiesen was f r ein guter er ist das hat er perfekt gemacht
675545 ich wusste dass es sehr schwierig ist hier zu berholen und musste einfach sehen keine fehler mehr zu machen
675546 das war kein geerbter zweiter platz sondern eine absolut grandiose leistung
675547 ich freue mich sehr f r timo und alle die an ihn geglaubt haben sein technisches verst ndnis und seine arbeitseinstellung bringen ihn voran und er war nicht zufrieden das spricht f r ihn
675548 so etwas ist nie eine berraschung ich war ein wenig entt uscht ber die tatsache dass ich felipe vorbei lie aber das ist keinesfalls so bel wie es h tte sein k nnen
675549 ich dachte dass ich eigentlich einen ganz guten start gehabt habe aber er hatte einen besseren
675550 das kam wirklich berraschend in der ersten kurve war der reifen pl tzlich platt
675551 man w nscht nat rlich niemandem pech aber es ist nat rlich schon wichtig dass man die punkte macht und es ist nat rlich gut dass heikki gewonnen hat
675552 wenn man sich das wochenende insgesamt ansieht dann haben wir gute fortschritte gemacht und wir k nnen viel mitnehmen
675553 leider war das rennen frustrierend ich habe es mir mit einem schlechten start selbst schwer gemacht nach einigen ecken war ich nur noch 14 ich kurve eins wurde ich rausgeschubst hatte dann ausgangs stark durchdrehende r der dadurch kamen einige au en vorbei
675554 ich konnte in runde drei rubens berholen das machte spa aber ich hing dann bald hinter heidfeld
675555 in den letzten beiden kurven war er sehr stark ich hatte also keine chance auf der strecke zu berholen und er war auf einem stopp unterwegs bei freier fahrt aber war unser tempo gut das wochenende war also klar ein schritt nach vorn ich bin recht zufrieden
675556 ich konnte vier r nge in der startrunde gutmachen aber das rennen war nicht sehr aufregend f r mich
675557 wir entschieden mit gebrauchten vorder und neuen hinterreifen zu beginnen was sich als problem herausstellte das auto hatte im ersten stint keine balance bei meinem ersten stopp gab es zudem ein problem mit der tankanlage was zu einem kleinen feuer und einer l ngeren verz gerung f hrte weil mit der zweiten anlage betankt werden musste
675558 danach war mein rennen eigentlich vorbei und die vielen blauen flaggen machten es unm glich wieder nach vorn zu kommen
675559 wir entschieden dann die drehzahlen des motors zu drosseln und etwas mit den reifen zu testen denn wir hatten an diesem wochenende probleme mit berhitzen es war gut da ein paar daten sammeln zu k nnen aber das rennen selbst konnte ich vergessen
675560 das rennen konnte von unseren startpositionen nicht einfach werden von anfang an wurden beide fahrer von heidfeld aufgehalten der auf einer anderen strategie unterwegs war das hinderte uns die wahre pace zu zeigen
675561 die neuen teile wie wir mit nach ungarn brachten haben uns ganz klar geholfen die leistung des autos zu verbessern aber es ist immer so dass der rest des feldes nicht stillsteht und wir haben noch nicht die pace aus eigener kraft punkte zu holen davon sind wir weit entfernt
675562 mein start war normal ich war in kurve eins au en aber ich musste einen etwas weiteren bogen fahren und verlor einen platz
675563 in runde drei begannen meine probleme als die bremsen berhitzten speziell hinten ich musste die bremsbalance nach vorn stellen ab da hatte ich gro e probleme die vorderr der blockierten oft und mit dem untersteuern war das auto schwierig zu handhaben
675564 angesichts dessen war die pace im ersten stint gar nicht so schlecht im zweiten stint wurde ich von der gruppe vor mir gar aufgehalten weil ich sehr leicht war da verlor ich zeit
675565 im letzten stint hatte ich einen plattfu vorne rechts beim bremsen dann gaben die bremsen ganz auf und das rennen war vorbei ich bin entt uscht denn wir haben an diesem wochenende hart gearbeitet und nach nur drei runden hatten wir das problem und ich konnte ich die gewollte leistung zeigen
675566 es war ein hartes rennen denn ich habe immer viel gek mpft
675567 zu beginn waren wir recht schwer unterwegs aber die pace war so schlecht nicht ich konnte mit den autos vor mir mithalten die williams vor mir blieben nur zwei runden l nger drau en und ich war direkt hinter ihnen selbst am rennende konnte ich in den schlussrunden 1 22 6er zeiten fahren das ist gut die strategie war gut wir haben das maximum im rennen geholt nun brauchen wir f r die n chsten rennen einen schritt nach vorn
675568 das war ein aufregendes rennen f r unsere jungs die unter den umst nden sehr gut gefahren sind
675569 giancarlo verlor am start einen rang aber beide fuhren gute erste stints wir setzten beide auf leicht unterschiedliche strategien adrian hatte einen kurzen mittelstint giancarlo einen l ngeren bei giancarlo konnten wir beim stopp einige berholen er konnte das beim letzten stopp zwar nicht halten aber wir konnten mit der gruppe vor uns mitfahren
675570 adrian dagegen hatte schon fr h bremsprobleme er musste die bremskraft nach vorn regeln und letztlich musste er wegen eines plattfu es aufgrund des bremsschadens aufgeben
675571 auch wenn es entt uschend ist nicht beide autos ins ziel gebracht zu haben so k nnen wir mit der leistung des teams zufrieden sein beide fahrer haben an diesem wochenende alles gegeben
675572 felipe du warst unterwegs zu einem fantastischen und redlich verdienten sieg wie f hlst du dich nach dem grausamen ausfall so kurz vor schluss
675573 nat rlich ist das kein sch nes gef hl wenn du zwei runden vor schluss pl tzlich ein mulmiges gef hl bekommst und der motor auf einmal eingeht ich f hle mich wirklich beschissen und bin nicht gl cklich ber das was passiert ist
675574 wir haben heute einen fantastischen job gemacht wenn das alles zwei runden vor schluss fl ten geht ist das nat rlich deprimierend ich f hle mich wirklich schlecht aber leider geh rt so etwas zu unserem sport dazu wir m ssen nach vorne schauen und schon an das n chste rennen denken wir haben jetzt eine kurze pause in der wir uns auf die letzten sieben rennen vorbereiten k nnen
675575 wie zuversichtlich warst du alles unter kontrolle zu haben und erz hl bitte auch vom start wo du ja auf grandiose weise in f hrung gegangen bist
675576 der start war entscheidend f r mein rennen das war unsere einzige chance hamilton zu berholen daher bin ich ein hohes risiko eingegangen aber es hat funktioniert ich finde es war ein fantastischer start und dann haben wir eine fantastische pace demonstriert ich konnte sogar einen vorsprung herausfahren der es mir erlaubte vorne zu bleiben obwohl meine strategie f r etwas k rzere stints ausgelegt war
675577 im ersten und zweiten stint haben wir ausgezeichnete arbeit geleistet mein ingenieur hat mir am funk alles genau erkl rt die boxenstopps waren auch klasse alles hat gepasst und dann als hamilton sein reifenproblem hatte reduzierte ich sofort die drehzahlen des motors um alles so gut wie m glich zu schonen ich hatte 22 sekunden vorsprung auf heikki und wusste dass ich keine probleme mit den reifen habe oder mit dem auto es ging nur darum das auto ins ziel zu tragen aber es hat nicht gereicht
675578 hast du dir schon vor dem start berlegt dass du au en berholen k nntest oder hast du einfach nach instinkt reagiert
675579 ich habe schon dar ber nachgedacht wie ich den start angehen k nnte es ist aber schwierig davor ber so etwas nachzudenken ich hatte mir in den kopf gesetzt dass ich an heikki vorbei muss denn ich stand auf der sauberen seite und wir haben normalerweise gute starts an ihm war ich schnell vorbei und dann wusste ich dass ich lewis nur packen kann wenn ich in seinem windschatten bin und einen geschwindigkeits berschuss habe genau das habe ich probiert lewis ging nach innen ich probierte es au en das hat funktioniert meine einzige chance dieses rennen zu gewinnen war ber den start
675580 das ist ein sehr gutes zeichen f r die n chsten rennen
675581 du h ttest heute gegen mclaren mercedes gewinnen k nnen ist das ein motivationsschub f r die letzten sieben rennen
675582 das selbstvertrauen ist da nach so einem rennen in dem du bist zwei runden vor schluss gef hrt hast der ausfall z hlt da nicht sondern es z hlt wie stark wir im rennen waren wir haben eine tolle performance und tolles teamwork gezeigt das ist ein sehr gutes zeichen f r die n chsten rennen
675583 warst du berrascht dar ber mclaren mercedes nach dem doch sehr engen qualifying gestern so unter kontrolle zu haben
675584 50 50 die leute schauen im qualifying immer darauf wer vorne steht und sie waren erster und zweiter ich nur dritter wir waren aber in q2 am schnellsten und wussten daher dass wir ein tolles auto haben es war eine starke runde und wir haben das potenzial des autos gezeigt im rennen war ich schon ein bisschen berrascht denn wir waren schneller ich hatte sie sehr sehr stark erwartet andererseits dachte ich ans q2 zur ck es war nicht schwierig die konzentration zu behalten und noch mehr zu pushen
675585 gab es anzeichen daf r dass sich der motor verabschieden k nnte
675586 nein ich habe es erst gesp rt als er kaputt ging
675587 dies war nat rlich f r uns ein sehr schwieriges rennen
675588 wir ver nderten meine strategie in eine ein boxenstopp strategie was das richtige war dankesch n an das team daf r danach war ich schwer unterwegs und k mpfte auf dem weicheren reifen musste also k mpfen um schnell zu sein
675589 ich hatte dann eine ber hrung mit fisichella und verlor eine position gl cklicherweise war ich in der lage sie wieder zur ck zu erobern als er seinen letzten boxenstopp einlegen musste das war alles was ich heute tun konnte wir m ssen aus diesem grund anschauen was passierte und versuchen uns f r das kommende rennen zu verbessern
675590 ich war am falschen ort und verlor ein paar positionen w hrend meines ersten boxenstopps ging etwas mit dem tank schlauch schief was mich ein paar entscheidende sekunden kostete und mich hinter fisichella zur ckwarf meine strategie war dann gelaufen mit der hitze hatte ich kein problem wir hatten definitiv dieses jahr schlimmere rennen
675591 auf einer strecke wie budapest ist das berholen extrem schwierig besonders wenn alle hintereinander aufgereiht fahren
675592 wir hatten keine gute erste runde beide autos verloren positionen wir hatten zudem an nicos auto ein problem mit dem tank schlauch was ihn hinter kazuki zur ckwarf dessen strategie wir ver ndert hatten

675618 the month is generally weak in the first half then stronger in the middle
675619 while the us european and japanese are contracting moderately the asian economy continues to experience growth that is near its potential and south american growth is just below potential
675620 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit consumers can spend using any of these buckets however with the labor market continuing to weaken housing continuing to deteriorate and credit harder to come by the outlook for spending remains bleak despite recent declines in gasoline prices
675621 it is nearly certain the fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the august 5 meeting the market expects a higher federal funds rate at the end of the year we do not the details of the gdp report point to significant weakness in the economy against this backdrop and financial market fragility the fed would only exacerbate the economic situation by raising the federal funds rate in haste fighting inflation will have to remain on the back burner until financial and economic conditions improve by that time inflation is likely to be moderating as it is a lagging economic process
675622 if it walks like a recession and talks like a recession it must be a recession is the fed going to raise its funds rate target over the remainder of 2008 not bloody likely
675623 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said the us is nowhere near the bottom of the housing slump and is right on the brink of a recession
675624 whitney says loosely transcribed fed knows there is no quick fix every time they open window they lose fire power for next crisis there is not much capital out there that wants to rescue brokers i keep saying we are less than 50 done with this crisis and are still there all capital raised by banks so far 450 billion was only to plug holes and not to grow business all banks assets marked at unrealistic levels creditors have cut mortgages and credit lines to the areas with the worst house prices depreciation that will hurt consumers even more corporate loan market will get hit soon as well maria was prodding to find out how quickly the stock prices were going back to the highs pump pump pump whitney says there is no way the bank stocks will return to the highs in next 3 years no comment on 5 years out the brokers are not growing capital and diluting the shareholder they cant grow earnings that way merrill raised tremendous amounts of capital just to plug holes they still have to shed assets and are not out of woods yet most every bank has to write down assets like merrill and raise capital banks who got in bed with housing assets such as c ubs mer bac wb will be in the market soon to do another capital raise everyone was involved in mortgages all of these banks are in trouble now 25 institutions will have to raise capital in next two months banks will cut dividends i dont understand why banks raise capital and then still pay a dividend it is not prudent for board members to keep paying when they are so capital restrained fannie freddie in same situation as every other institution all banks are betting on house price assumptions that are far too optimistic no banks are close to case shiller due to banks bad math losses will apply to everyone across the board in 2006 07 2 5 trillion was securitized nobody can replace this mortgage money and housing prices will continue to suffer as a result when maria asked if lehman will survive she said huh huh huh huh huh huh i dont know i am very opinionated on the short selling rule if you want to have faith in the capital market there has to be two sides to every trade and people have to be able to hedge restricting free trade will have the opposite effect and endanger the markets jamie dimon and goldman are pros and very cautious and aware of risks
675625 the us may now be in a very long recession that will drive the unemployment rate higher with little that the federal reserve can do to help said harvard university professor martin feldstein
675626 i dont see recovery on the horizon feldstein who headed the national bureau of economic research until june and serves on the groups recession dating panel said in an interview with bloomberg radio
675627 feldstein said the fed has already lowered interest rates as much as it can to help growth and that exports offer the only bright spot while they arent strong enough to fuel a recovery
675628 the next president should not be raising taxes feldstein said he said he was really surprised that obama hasnt backed off his proposals for a major tax increase
675629 feldstein said todays gross domestic product figures reinforced his view that the economy entered a recession in december or january gdp shrank at the end of 2007 and grew less than forecast in this years second quarter the commerce department reported today
675630 fed officials have lowered their benchmark rate to 2 from 5 25 since september bringing the reductions to a halt in june amid rising concern that inflation will accelerate feldstein indicated the central bank should refrain from lowering borrowing costs further
675631 real gross domestic product of the us economy grew at an annual rate of 1 9 in the second quarter following a revised 0 9 increase in the first quarter this report also contained revisions of gdp estimates going back to the first quarter of 2005
675632 real gdp grew at a slightly slower pace during the period of revision 2005 2007 the most noteworthy aspect was the contraction in real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 0 2 from an increase of 0 6 as per the previously published estimate
675633 in the second quarter consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1
675634 exports of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 9
675635 total nonfarm payrolls fell by 51 000 in july the seventh consecutive monthly decline
675636 in the past 12 months private nonfarm payrolls have declined by a net 535 000 in the past 12 months the so called birth death adjustment has added a net 853 000 jobs
675637 the white house cut its forecast for us economic growth this year and indicated president george w bushs successor will face the dual headwinds of rising unemployment and faster inflation
675638 us gross domestic product will grow 1 6 this year and expand 2 2 in 2009 the white houses council of economic advisers said in a mid year review today the forecasts were slashed from an outlook in february for 2 7 growth this year and 3 for 2009
675639 the effects of the economic slump have worsened the job market and the white house forecast the jobless rate will average 5
675640 the us economy has continued to expand but growth has slowed as a result of the sharp housing decline disruptions in financial markets and high energy prices the report said
675641 the consumer price index will rise 3 8 this year compared with a february forecast for 2 7 the white house said next year the cost of living will increase 2 3 faster than the 2 1 gain predicted five months ago
675642 the white houses latest forecast for gdp growth was similar to private economists for this year and more optimistic for 2009 the economy will expand 1 6 in 2008 and grow 1 7 in 2009 according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by blue chip economic indicators this month
675643 the us treasury on monday said its borrowing would increase to 171 billion this quarter let us note three important points 1 budget deficits increase 50 to 100 in recessions 2 official budget deficit estimates historically greatly underestimate the deficits due to ridiculous assumptions and 3 surging nationalization and socialization is substantially increasing us guarantees and debt
675644 the credit squeeze in the us economy is likely to persist for many months and might even get worse gary stern president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis has told the financial times
675645 he said that with interest rates at 2 the fed was well placed to cope with any negative surprises on growth by contrast he said it was not as well positioned to deal with any negative surprises on inflation
675646 even without any such surprises the minneapolis fed chief also said real interest rates were at levels that if sustained for too long would not be compatible with medium term price stability
675647 president george w bush signed into law legislation that helps 400 000 homeowners facing foreclosure and extends a lifeline to fannie mae and freddie mac
675648 bush signed the measure at the white house shortly after 7 a m spokesman tony fratto said treasury secretary henry paulson housing and urban development secretary steve preston and federal housing administration director brian montgomery were among those present
675649 we look forward to putting in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac fratto said
675650 the law is aimed at stemming foreclosures and halting a free fall in housing prices by providing federal insurance for refinanced 30 year mortgages for homeowners struggling to make their monthly payments
675651 the measure also is designed to restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by tightening regulations and authorizing the treasury secretary to inject capital into the two biggest u s providers of mortgage money
675652 banks have been given a one year reprieve by us accounting standard setters from having to take up to 5 000 billion of debt assets on to their balance sheets easing fears that they would be forced to raise large amounts of new capital quickly
675653 the financial accounting standards board voted to delay until january 2010 the introduction of rules that will force banks to consolidate more off balance sheet vehicles directly in their accounts
675654 robert herz fasb chairman said that the move was made reluctantly after a staff recommendation for a delay because there might not be enough time for all companies to adjust to the up heaval
675655 it does pain me to allow something that has been abused by certain folks to let that go on for another year he said
675656 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit
675657 high inventories suggest still falling house prices putting further pressure on consumers balance sheets
675658 access to credit is likely to become harder to come by and more expensive
675659 consumer cash flows seem unlikely to improve anytime soon the labor market weakness evident in the claims figures suggest continued weakness in non farm payrolls
675660 data through may 2008 released today by standard amp poors for its s amp p case shiller1 home price indices the leading measure of us home prices show annual declines in the prices of existing single family homes across the united states generally continued to worsen in may 2008

675665 banks struggling to recover from multibillion dollar losses on real estate are curtailing loans to american businesses depriving even healthy companies of money for expansion and hiring
675666 two vital forms of credit used by companies commercial and industrial loans from banks and short term commercial paper not backed by collateral collectively dropped almost 3 over the last year to 3
675667 the scarcity of credit has intensified the strains on the economy by withholding capital from many companies just as joblessness grows and consumers pull back from spending in the face of high gas prices plummeting home values and mounting debt
675668 the second half of the year is shot said michael t
675669 companies that rely on credit are now delaying and canceling expansion plans as they struggle to secure finance
675670 merrill lynch is to raise an extra 8 5 billion in fresh capital on top of 23 5 billion already raised in the past 12 months as the beleaguered investment bank took some drastic steps to right its capital position
675671 merrill which just two weeks ago announced plans to raise almost 8 billion from asset sales including its 20 stake in financial news provider bloomberg revealed that it needs to raise the money after disclosing that it will take a financial hit of 10 6 billion in the third quarter
675672 the news will come as a surprise to the financial community which had hoped that the worse was over for merrill which has already been one of the largest victims to date of the continuing credit crisis
675673 prior to this latest series of writedowns and exceptional losses merrill has already written down 40 billion in assets and other instruments
675674 but chairman and chief executive john thain said that the news was positive because of the fact it has been able to off load the substantial majority of its positions in a certain type of complex debt vehicle
675675 mr thain who took over from stan oneal last december said the news marked a significant milestone in our risk reduction efforts
675676 leading global banks including citigroup and ubs on tuesday faced renewed pressure to write down or sell billions of dollars in toxic assets following merrill lynchs disposal of 30 billion in mortgage related securities at a cut price
675677 merrills move to sell collateralised debt obligations cdos for 6 7 billion or 22 cents on the dollar announced on monday night raised hopes that other banks would be able to strike similar deals and purge their balance sheets of bad assets
675678 however the low price paid by lone star funds a distressed debt investor to buy merrills cdos sparked fears that the financial system could enter another spiral of huge writedowns followed by highly dilutive capital raisings
675679 merrill on tuesday raised 8 5 billion to offset 5 7 billion of writedowns caused by the cdo sales and other losses by selling shares at 22 50 a 7 5 discount to mondays close
675680 mike mayo deutsche bank analyst said merrills action a fortnight after john thain chief executive said that it did not need more capital raises ongoing credibility issues for the industry
675681 developed market bond yields should move markedly higher through the rest of this summer but then fall sharply going into 2009 says daniel pfaendler head of g10 economics amp strategy at dresdner kleinwort
675682 he believes the oil price shock and the unwinding of asset bubbles over leverage and economic imbalances in general should keep growth significantly below trend and real yields depressed for a protracted period of time
675683 price stability oriented central banks having learned their lessons from the 1970s should become more hawkish in the near term thereby limiting the upward pressure on long run inflation expectations mr pfaendler says
675684 however he believes inflation will peak around autumn and then fall significantly into 2009
675685 he adds that the positive growth effects of us tax rebates should dissipate raising the risk of a simultaneous recession in the us the eurozone and the uk during winter
675686 therefore real yields and inflation expectations should be able to fall in tandem making long duration as well as curve steepening exposure across developed bond markets attractive again
675687 do you remember treasury secretary paulson rushing all over the world beijing moscow berlin tokyo you name it
675688 the dollar on a purchasing power parity is ridiculously cheap now
675689 in my opinion that was the deal that was the reason why paulson was running all over the world with his secret message
675690 faced with a swelling federal budget deficit as a slowing economy saps tax revenues the us treasury is expected to boost the frequency of 10 year note sales and offer more 30 year bonds next month
675691 analysts estimate the treasury will announce plans to sell 15 billion to 16 billion in 10 year notes and 9 billion to 10 billion in long bonds at its refunding announcement on wednesday
675692 theres a realization that these higher deficits are going to be with us for a while because the outlook for growth in the second half and into next year has deteriorated said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap in jersey city new jersey
675693 could we be watching a vicious but erratic correction in an ongoing bull market as far as im concerned this is the multi trillion dollar question of the day and the month and the year because if this is a correction rather than a primary bear market then this market could tend to hold and this market could be building a base and if so then 18 billion shorts will begin to get squeezed and if this market is in the process of building a base then the big money will begin slowly and subtly to re enter the market
675694 fullermoney has been very cautious regarding western banks for a number of months not least because of the weak performance and obvious fundamental problems
675695 i would now describe my view as cautiously bullish which requires some explanation
675696 taking a longer term view i would not be surprised to see a signification consolidation within the western banking industry over the next few years this will inevitably favour the strong players meanwhile conservative investors may prefer bank bonds to equity
675697 looking at the charts action for bank indices such as s amp p 500 regional banks dj euro banks and ftse 350 banks we certainly had climactic action in mid july as pointed out at the time
675698 while these bank indices have eased in the last three days after encountering overhead resistance evident from the january march range lows they have retained more of the recent rally than broader indices in the usa continental europe and the uk this may have something to do with the recent investigations regarding shorting but it could also indicate that the banks themselves are less bearish of their sector from a bullish perspective it would be encouraging if bank indices maintained their recent relative strength and also held at least half of this months gains
675699 the outperformance of japanese stocks over the past few months looks set to continue believes paul danis equity strategist at lehman brothers
675700 after strongly underperforming from early 2006 to march this year japan has outperformed the global equity market by 14 in dollar terms and 24 in local currency terms since mid march he says we think that the rally has legs
675701 mr danis notes that the total cash yield in japan has bucked the global trend and kept rising as net stock buybacks have increased in contrast to the us and uk
675702 mr danis also says that while the economic backdrop in japan is far from great he expects growth to be strong relative to the rest of the world some key japanese economic indicators are showing resilience and there are continued signs that japans economy is exiting a deflationary period
675703 he adds that analysts have aggressively marked down japanese company earnings expectations while for the world ex japan composite earnings are still at peak levels there is scope for this gap to close which should benefit japanese stocks relative to global markets in aggregate
675704 we recommend investors with a global mandate overweight japan in equity dedicated portfolios
675705 the three major currencies of central europe have appreciated strongly against the euro so far this year boosted to varying degrees by rising interest rates strong economic growth and positive investor sentiment the latter buoyed by the final confirmation that slovakia will adopt the euro next january
675706 zimbabwes economy is unravelling at such a pace that the central bank is set to slash yet more zeroes from the countrys increasingly worthless currency
675707 state media on sunday quoted gideon gono the reserve bank of zimbabwe governor and one of the members of the ruling elite targeted by fresh western sanctions last week as saying he would extend a currency policy that has so far failed to stem hyperinflation
675708 this time we will make sure that those zeroes that would come knocking on the governors window will not return mr gono was quoted as saying on saturday in a speech to farmers
675709 independent estimates put zimbabwes inflation rate well above the official 2 2 million per cent prompting the introduction last week of a 100 billion zimbabwean dollar note even state media reported mr gonos comments drew laughter from his audience
675710 the governor is expected to chop three or six zeroes from the currency following a three zero cut in 2006
675711 beside the inflationary zeroes haunting mr gono analysts and some opposition politicians say the crumbling economy in what was once a regional bread basket is perhaps the single greatest factor that might force robert mugabe president into relaxing his grip on power
675712 the government blames the economic strife on illegal sanctions condemning opponents who point to violence land seizures that have contributed to a drastic fall in agricultural output
675713 global growth is downshifting and the cyclical economic backdrop is no longer supportive of further commodity price gains
675714 inflation angst should begin to recede now that food and energy prices are gradually coming off the boil
675715 the weaker growth outlook along with reductions in energy subsidies and a tightening in policy by several emerging market central banks because of inflation concerns related to the commodity boom will only reinforce the tendency for commodity demand growth to slow
675716 1 the oil price is currently by far the most important factor in terms of global gdp growth consequently it is also a huge influence on the direction of various stock market indices and big moves up or down have a psychological leash effect on other commodities including gold
675717 i am a long term believer in peak oil but a short term sceptic even some of the best and most farsighted analysts often predict dramatic seminal events many years before they actually occur not least i suspect because life is short and our time is precious
675718 meanwhile the daily chart of crude oil has shown increasingly conclusive evidence of a significant peak commencing with that big downward dynamic on 15th july
675719 heavy bets in deep out of the money calls and other bullish plays in the gold options market indicate bullion has a shot at rallying to an all time peak of 1 200 an ounce by the end of the year
675720 gold has soared furiously a few years ago the metal was trading at 250 an ounce as investors poured into the market due to inflation fears a weakened dollar and market turmoil
675721 there are a lot of people who think that by the end of the year well be trading 1 200 to 1 500 they are not very expensive options so people are buying them
675722 bilello said that many option investors were currently adjusting positions after golds sharp fall but he saw recent strong volume of december 1 000 calls bull call spreads between 1 200 and 1 300 and the selling of put options all of which are betting that gold will rise further
675723 inflation in europe accelerated to the fastest pace in more than 16 years in july restricting the european central banks room to bolster the economy even as unemployment starts to increase
675724 the inflation rate for the 15 nation euro region rose to 4
675725 the ecb which aims to keep inflation just below 2 raised its key interest rate by a quarter point to 4 25 on july 3 a seven year high the risk is that higher borrowing costs will exacerbate the economic slowdown europes manufacturing and service industries are contracting and confidence in the economic outlook this month plunged the most since the september 11 terrorist attacks in 2001
675726 the growth outlook has deteriorated said martin van vliet an economist at ing group in amsterdam who doesnt expect the ecb to raise rates again
675727 australia may be headed for a housing recession similar to those roiling the us and uk
675728 the cause is a combination of rising default rates the biggest drop in home prices in five years the highest borrowing costs in a decade and slowing economic growth
675729 prices in the property market described by the international monetary fund in april as one of the worlds most overvalued will fall 30 by 2010 according to gerard minack senior economist at morgan stanley in sydney
675730 australia is headed for a once in 100 year real estate slump john edwards chief executive officer of residex ltd
675731 the international monetary fund urged the bank of japan to refrain from raising interest rates for now as the worlds second largest economy heads for a soft landing
675732 bank of japan policy should remain accommodative as imf directors see little risk in delaying monetary tightening the washington based lender said today in its annual review of the japanese economy
675733 the funds 1 5 growth forecast for this year matches the median estimate among economists surveyed by bloomberg news the assessment indicates japan will avoid a contraction even as exports weaken hurt by slowing demand in the us and europe
675734 the japanese economy has shown resilience to the us slowdown and global financial turmoil the imf said in the review the near term economic outlook is for a soft landing although there remain risks from the global economy
675735 inflation excluding food and fuel prices is expected to stay contained and an undervalued yen may rise against other currencies it said
675736 inflation in japan accelerated in june to 1 9 the fastest pace in more than a decade because of surging energy and food prices
675737 japan was until recently in deflation and so price pressures remain mild compared with most of the world excluding energy and food cpi rose just 0 1 last month
675738 japans inflation is not caused by domestic demand so the bank of japan is seen to have little scope to raise rates from the current level of 0 5 the banks concern is increasingly turning towards growth
675739 this month the central bank cut its economic growth forecast from 1 5 to 1 2 for the year ending march 2009
675740 the squeeze on consumers is likely to hit consumption in the second quarter coupled with last months first export decline in more than 4 years some economists are forecasting that second quarter gdp growth will be negative
675741 foreign investors have become extremely wary of the russian stock market after the kremlin moved yet again to tighten its noose around the countrys energy and mining sector launching anti trust probes against london listed evraz holding and raspadsky coal
675742 the move follows last weeks assault on steel and coal giant mechel for alleged overpricing of raw materials and using offshore trading to cut its tax bill
675743 moscows rts stock market index has fallen by 25 since may on fears that premier vladimir putin is once again using probes or other heavy handed methods to reorder the strategic landscape
675744 the bare knuckle fight for control over bps russian tnk bp has deeply shocked investors in the city and new york
675745 the market is panicking and foreign investors are pulling out of equities said michael ganske a russia expert at commerzbank
675746 people fear that the rule of law is breaking down i think this is an overreaction but the russian government has to be careful in the way it uses rhetoric in this investment climate he said
675747 i would not have any recriminations towards either the government or the employers because everybody quite genuinely did their level best but it just wasnt possible on the day the conditions werent right
675748 for ordinary people the real costs have increased very significantly and people at the lower end of the socio economic spectrum spend a much higher proportion of their disposable income on food and on energy
675749 if you load them all up to the same degree with a somewhat higher wage increase it doesnt mean that their competitive position has altered negatively for them so i dont hold completely with the employers analysis
675750 when you try to fit one shoe on everything there will always be places where it pinches a little bit more you have to consider really the common good in all of this and the common good from our point of view were people on the lower end of the income spectrum
675751 we felt really that this was an occasion where we needed something like a social solidarity pact
675752 that is the principal commanding case for social partnership that we spread the goods throughout the economy as best we can we get the fairest deal for everybody but that is the way it is and thats where we find ourselves
675753 there is a big social and economic pillar to social partnership that remains intact all the institutions of that model remain intact the public at large are not very much aware of that but they are quite significant and they remain there
675754 these are very preliminary numbers and i think once we take a closer look at them they will be significantly lower
675755 in essence this process deprived defendant of his right to be presumed innocent and shifted the burden to him to prove his innocence
675756 what about those bright kids who arent lucky enough to find mentors or to be born in intellectual households
675757 however in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries science became too technical and mathematical for the philosophers or anyone else except for a few specialists
675758 there are not many engineers who can boast of having rendered humanity such a valuable service
675759 there are not many engineers who can boast of having rendered humanity such a valuable service
675760 science is not perfect it is often misused it is only a tool but it is the best tool we have
675761 farmers who domesticate cattle really want to have the benefits of cattle and there isnt a huge debate about whether the cattle really exist
675762 i dont think dennett would view a world filled with constructive falsehoods as anything more than a stopgap solution
675763 scientific truth is too beautiful to be sacrificed for the sake of light entertainment or money astrology is an aesthetic affront it cheapens astronomy like using beethoven for commercial jingles
675764 since our inner experiences consist of reproductions and combinations of sensory impressions the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning
675765 the individual organism is a very important unit in the hierarchy of life but however unitary and discrete an individual wolf or buffalo may be the package is temporary and unique
675766 the objections to religion are of two sorts intellectual and moral the intellectual objection is that there is no reason to suppose any religion true the moral objection is that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel than they are and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the moral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow
675767 reality is dreams second album it was completed by and set to be released in 2003 but never hit retail stores it is currently available for purchase on frances virgin records music site
675768 the entirety of all that is real the state of being actual or real based on the actual or that which exists or that which has been purchased to exist each individuals own subjective perception of that which is real
675769 you cant use your religious beliefs to get away with harming a child
675770 this is so much bigger than myself this is about not allowing the cover of religion to permit physical abuse in a church and particularly to a child
675771 inconsistent with us supreme court precedent and extends far beyond the protections our constitution affords religious conduct
675772 the first amendment guards religious liberty it does not sanction intentional abuse in religions name
675773 the larger protection of the church and religious freedom is the overriding concern
675774 the government cant get involved in overseeing religious practices the best way to say it is its not american
675775 there have been races this year where ive been in a position to challenge for victory but had something go wrong for me
675776 halfway through this race things started working for me and i started pushing felipe hard and it worked i feel sorry for felipe because he drove a great race but my car felt good and i knew i could push for the victory this is a great moment for me something ive been targeting for many years hopefully this victory will be the first of many
675777 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
675778 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish hackneyed it may be but its true nonetheless even so you have to feel sorry for felipe who did a very good job but heikki drove superbly scoring his first grand prix victory in fine style and converting his excellent qualifying pace which has been apparent all season into a thoroughly well deserved win lewiss race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasnt to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at mclaren is absolutely delighted for him
675779 assembling to march and protest is a citizens right but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests

675816 when youre a teenager you just take everything in you absorb all these ideas
675817 it just opened my mind not only to new ideas but just that theres a bigger world out there and that i can do anything i want and so when i got home i was like im going to be a filmmaker thats when i decided when i was about 17 and i stuck to my guns
675818 theyre revealing themselves in a way that could follow them for the rest of their lives
675819 i felt the weight of that responsibility when i was making it
675820 i knew i wanted it to be a town that had only one high school
675821 and i wanted it to be economically mixed and i was hoping for it to be racially mixed but that was hard to find in the midwest in small towns
675822 much more than my film and theres much more of an emphasis on wealth and competition
675823 more stagy we want to control everything in america its unfortunate
675824 i think theres something mean spirited about a lot of them too theyre appealing to the basest part of ourselves weve become bottom feeders
675825 i think that because this film is about teenagers there is a natural assumption that its influenced by reality tv because there is so much reality tv about teenagers
675826 but a lot of reality tv got their cues from documentaries and now documentaries are being criticized for learning things from reality tv funny
675827 there were parallel story lines a bit more like you have in
675828 so it was written like that but in the editing process my editor and i realized it wasnt working that left us in a kind of crisis especially me because everybody really liked the script everybody loved the script and i remember going into the shoot with a huge attitude like i knew i had the cast and i knew i had the script and i felt like nothing could go wrong and then it was like waking up we saw the first rough cut and discovered that it didnt work at all
675829 i tell you man people dont doubt you anymore but you cant believe the hype dont believe the hype thats very important

675861 when sony first announced that the playstation 3 would be able to run linux natively a great deal of excitement ensued early on it was a bit of a challenge to get linux natively installed the supported installer ran a custom script that hand mangled a fedora core 5 or 6 install dvd into a runnable system with a special ps3 kernel people put in hours and hours of effort to get other systems such as ubuntu working terrasofts yellow dog linux with an actual graphical installer that ran on the ps3 was the king of the hill time has passed and a great deal has changed fedora 7 installs on the ps3 out of the box with the most challenging parts being selecting the ps3 storage driver so it can find the install dvd and remembering to specify a video mode on the initial install command line so youll be able to see the installer so you can run linux on the ps3 its easy the problem is it doesnt necessarily run well if you picked the ps3 up as a cheap cell development system its a little frustrating to discover that having followed the default install procedure you have a system that comes up with a hundred megs or more of swap in use by the time you get to a shell prompt

675926 when the price of oil was not significant we lost sight of the need to work towards cost effective and environmental friendly solutions to our energy needs the escalating energy costs have prompted many scientists and leaders across the world to put their thinking caps on and divest their energies to come up with less expensive and more importantly sustainable alternatives
675927 while striving to conserve energy both at the macro and micro level sri lanka must now look within to find cost effective environmentally friendly solutions to fulfill her energy needs a few examples are the mini hydro projects dendro power projects the pilot wind energy project which is situated in hambantota the ez stove is also a development in the right direction
675928 we as individuals must set an example to others by making an effort to reduce energy waste as mahatma gandhi said be the change you want to see in this world
675929 the initial r amp d phase was a fun time for me
675930 i built a small laboratory at home and experimented with many designs of stoves and with various fuels during my spare time after many months of proto typing and testing i came up with the ez turbo charcoal stove that i believe is the closest cost effective alternative to lpg and kerosene based cooking stoves
675931 wood charcoal is widely used in many african and latin american countries as an alternative to wood as it emits very little or no smoke when lit and has a higher calorific value compared to wood it is also a good substitute to fossil fuels like lpg and kerosene however in order to make wood charcoal felling of trees is required at the expense of the environment that is why i have chosen coconut shell based charcoal derived from coconut shells a bi product from the coconut processing industries and also domestic kitchens

675972 a major increase in innovative activity in china the republic of korea and the united states has driven the overall growth of patent filings in 2006 this reflects a consolidation of earlier trends which demonstrate a marked shift in innovation hubs around the world
675973 while use of the patent system remains highly concentrated among a group of countries statistics show an increasing level of patent activity in emerging countries this is an encouraging trend

675981 mother of the church cf insegnamenti ii 1964 675 an image and model not only of the christian but as the holy fathers teach of the entire mystical body of christ
675982 however it seems that a number of the groups have voted for a ban on gay bishops and church blessings for homosexual couples as part of a long term plan to preserve at least the core of the communion
675983 bullies always come back for more and the one thing that i think the archbishop is blind to is the fact that nothing short of total victory will satisfy these guys
675984 the bishops conference has worked for years to enact a national housing trust fund because affordable housing is vitally important to the stability and sustainability of families and communities throughout the country
675985 this new institution and resources are welcome signs that that the administration and congress can work together across party lines to make the housing needs of low income families a common national priority
675986 most of the assets of the church of england in terms of buildings schools and other property either come from the pre reformation catholic church or as a direct result of the tractarian and catholic revival
675987 this property is very much our heritage and inheritance and to suggest that many wish to steal it from us in a very unpleasant form of legalised theft would not be an understatement
675988 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
675989 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
675990 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness
675991 love between a married couple expressed in sex brings the human body closer to heaven the ecstasy in the joy of sexual intercourse can be likened to the joy of eternal life
675992 this is why the conjugal act allows spouses to begin to understand the sweetness of encountering god
675993 concentration on the physiological side of a sexual intercourse causes reduction of its most important elements
675994 when a woman is excited she wants to experience absolute pleasure as much as a man does
675995 the feeling of sexual dissatisfaction for a woman who is already excited is a great physical and psychological suffering
675996 i look at it this way you dont have to have a heart condition to be a cardiologist and you dont have to be an alcoholic to work as a therapist
675997 the holy fathers theology of the body and other philosophical and theological works delve deeply into the divinity of sexual relations in marriage im just making these complex ideas more accessible to average catholics
675998 the workshops with father knotz really helped us to overcome our inhibitions and guilt regarding sex
675999 he really listens to couples and this is why i think he understands us so well
676000 its a novel approach which in my experience helps couples achieve greater intimacy so why not
676001 the diocese was aware of that and therefore was able to resolve the case at considerably less than it would have been worth in the eyes of a jury
676002 but it appears unlikely this case can be resolved without a jury
676003 the amount awarded in this present case seriously challenges the diocese in its ability to resolve the remaining cases and therefore does merit review
676004 its a chance to bring tabula rasas fiction alive for the players in real life role playing
676005 its one of those just in case tabula rasa comes true and we have to rebuild humanity from scratch
676006 its like the fans get to come along for the ride
676007 ive been trying to get into space since about 1985
676008 its a safe bet that ill be the first hardcore gamer in space we wouldnt want to let that opportunity pass by
676009 if the space has value which it clearly does and its donated to the officeholder or the campaign it needs to be reported
676010 im over there and im responding to something that has to do with senate activities
676011 i dont do campaign work out of my business office
676012 carl just thought it was better to end the practice altogether so there wouldnt be any questions
676013 texas law is designed to prevent campaign contributions from being used to enrich the officeholders or their spouses
676014 there are firewalls and clear standards that have been set
676015 this piece youve submitted is simply beautiful perfectly described extremely visual
676016 my hope is that the website will be used by individuals as a way of developing their own prayer story and hopefully it will keep people posted on projects retreats and events happening in the diocese
676017 it is a channel of information but it is also about formation
676018 we have been hugely impressed with what hakki refai has developed for 3dicon at ou including our flagship 3d technology cspace
676019 his joining our team as cto is a testament to our mutual confidence in the upcoming commercialization of the technologies that he has spearheaded
676020 as we start to build potential licensing and development partnerships for our 3d technologies having dr refai
676021 it is my goal to advance and deliver critical milestones that will drive the advancement and commercialization of our technologies in the emerging 3d industry
676022 one of the most fulfilling parts of my job is to see fine young people like hakki move on to technology leadership roles

676031 infused with ragged unpredictability what we do is secret s wild concerts are its high points yet the scripts desire to transform darby shane west into some sort of tragic icon is undercut by two dimensional characterizations and an inability to convey the greatness of its protagonists music thereby making his story something of an appropriate secret
676032 a busy author for the screen and the stage mr davis wrote 15 movies and dozens of scripts for television series and he had a hand in five broadway shows including writing a 1945 play about four sailors back from the war and the book for vicki baums novel which was directed and choreographed by and which ran for more than 1 000 performances from 1989 to 1992
676033 with its tale set to plaintive country guitars about a man forced to take justice into his own hands red exudes a distinct 70s southern exploitation vibe
676034 faced with a choice between accepting powerlessness and asserting strength avery understandably chooses the latter but the films climax ultimately seems less an example of its protagonists irrational fury than of cockeyed storytelling
676035 compassionate but detached portrait that ultimately seeks to capture the spirit of a movement rather than fully examine the unique people and diverse work that comprised it
676036 at once melodrama and social problem picture entertainment and expos remains significant today for helping us grasp some sense of the attitudes and feelings about mental illness and state hospitalization prevalent in the united states in the late 1940s
676037 we just couldnt get our heads around the cell technology
676038 its just really complicated and im sure you noticed other games like stranglehold push their dates up cells really really powerful the problem is its also a really different system the way it uses multi threading technology
676039 now were up to showing ps3 at the same level and only one day behind the xbox which is really exciting for us
676040 i think its closing there are still difficulties on it i think you still see some games push out their playstation ports a little bit later i think now the supports there at least weve had many conversations with sony trying to get our heads around that

676050 its ok to change your mind in politics if it benefits your country
676051 to mislead the american people as to thinking its going to reduce the price at the pump
676052 absolutely we try to take advantage of as many of the capabilities of xbox live as we can
676053 the customer there is a very strong and dedicated customer theyre very loyal and use a lot of the feature sets so our sense is theyll be using chat and their avatars as much as microsoft says they will putting guys in football gear or battle gear and making them available will be part of the plan
676054 i am beginning to think that a journey might shake you up your trouble is a sleepy soul you have quite simply fallen asleep and you have fallen asleep not out of any satiety or weariness but from the lack of any vivid impressions or sensations
676055 but what is stranger what is more incomprehensible than anything is that authors can choose such subjects i confess that it is quite beyond my grasp it really is it is absolutely without profit to our country
676056 and yet in spite of it all are there not absurd things everywhere when you think it over there really is something in it despite what anyone may say such things do happen not often but they do happen
676057 its great bringing my movie to a place that i feel familiar
676058 not like the cannes film festival where nobodys speaking english or the tribeca film festival where no one sits down
676059 theres something poetic about coming back to the place where i used to come for holidays camping trips with my dad and stepmother and my very large family
676060 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
676061 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
676062 there arent a lot of role models for us in the world or people we can look up to
676063 people who are not afraid to stick their neck out people who are not afraid to stand up for things and be unpopular to go against the grain think outside the box
676064 and we need and i need michael moore in my life
676065 the more things change the more they stay the same
676066 we expect a contact between mr solana and mr jalili soon by phone
676067 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
676068 the conventional wisdom is that an entrepreneur sees an opportunity comes up with a business plan to capitalize on it determines the capital that needs to be raised raises the capital and then applies it to building the business described in the business plan

676080 to do something that has a big budget a great scope with a great director and great actors that has the quality and level of writing and the level of production design is a once in a lifetime opportunity
676081 any actor in his right mind would want to do this film would die to do it
676082 i would really come back for the people the thai people seem to be incredibly generous warm kind of loving people so its very nice to be around them the crews are magnificent and everybody ive met in my brief time off has been lovely

676090 looking back four or five years ago i would have never thought id be doing this i thought i was going to become an anthropologist
676091 the main point of buddhism appealed to me of the purpose of life being to end suffering
676092 that really appealed to me instead of faith or anything like that
676093 the day is consisted of debate studying reflection and you go to class with various gurus its a pretty busy day
676094 so for my entire study period thats where ill be but afterwards since im a western monk as opposed to a tibetan monk theres an organization ill probably be involved in after im done with my study ill probably be teaching or leading retreats or maybe visiting prisons
676095 no way was i going to let him do it the first time he asked me i thought if i put him off hed grow out of it but he didnt
676096 my husband steve and i did not have children to tell them what they can and cant do in their lives
676097 as long as ive raised my kids ive told them that they can do anything they want to in life who am i to tell him that this is not what he should do with his life
676098 you raise them you teach them good morals and give them a good grounding then you have to let them go at some point
676099 ever since we told him he can do this hes been happier than ive ever seen him
676100 robbies my best friend im his number one fan so its very hard to know that somebody who can make you laugh in two seconds or bring you up when youre feeling down is not going to be there i love him more than anything
676101 but you have to realize as a parent are you going to be selfish and not let them do something because youre going to be sad about it
676102 im a little stressed out trying to get everything in order it hasnt really hit me yet i dont think it will eventually
676103 im just trying to accustom myself to what they say about culture shock
676104 not only is it a foreign country its india its not like im going to france or anything it will be shocking landing in delhi in a city of nine or 10 million people
676105 i think it will be the best decision ill probably make in life
676106 taking ordination as a monk will probably be the foundation for the rest of my life

676114 una figura transcendental en el devenir hist rico de los valencianos y de la europa del siglo xv
676115 ha llegado el momento de que los socialistas valencianos recuperemos esa mayor a social que hagamos debates pensando en la ciudadan a y no en nosotros mismos
676116 que salgamos con propuestas tiles para los valencianos con un equipo cohesionado y fuerte que represente bien este nuevo tiempo
676117 porque para ferraz y el gobierno argumenta los valencianos son una prioridad
676118 los anhelos de la mayor a de la comunidad valenciana
676119 algo que no est ocurriendo en este momento aduce porque hay un gobierno que ha estado mucho tiempo en guerras internas y eso les ha impedido gobernar
676120 ni el propio solbes se cree el programa electoral del psoe
676121 el pleno empleo era m s una ambici n que un an lisis t cnico
676122 las promesas en materia de vivienda de pleno empleo de inflaci n y de impuestos son s lo una quimera
676123 mentir a sabiendas de que no iba a cumplir sus promesas
676124 un gobierno que se mueve por la ambici n de un pa s puede llegar muy lejos pero uno que como el de zapatero se mueve por ambiciones personales se convierte en el par sito de ese pa s
676125 si como admite el propio solbes la situaci n econ mica de espa a es peor de lo que el gobierno preve a estamos ante el ejecutivo m s irresponsable de la democracia espa ola
676126 advirti hasta la saciedad acerca de lo que se nos ven a encima si zapatero no actuaba y lamentablemente a adi zapatero no actu
676127 pretenda hacer creer a los ciudadanos que siempre han intentado ser transparentes
676128 mientras el pp advert a de que ven a el lobo de la crisis el se or zapatero afirmaba sin tapujos que espa a estaba en la champions league de la econom a
676129 las declaraciones de solbes son muy reveladoras y no tienen desperdicio ninguno
676130 los ciudadanos pueden comprobar c mo el n mero tres del gobierno de espa a admite descoordinaci n entre los ministerios o da como bueno que la inflaci n en nuestro pa s est al 5 por ciento mientras en los pa ses europeos est al 4 por ciento lo que aunque fuera cierto agreg ya que la situaci n es mucho peor ser a un claro indicativo de que el optimismo socialista empieza a ser muy peligroso para la econom a espa ola
676131 admite que los problemas de la legislatura pasada eran los mismos pero en otras circunstancias
676132 las circunstancias a las que se refiere solbes eran las circunstancias que dej el pp y que ellos han pulverizado con su inmovilismo y dejadez
676133 de una situaci n sana y preparada para afrontar los problemas importados que dice el ministro nos han llevado a una situaci n de total indefensi n
676134 pese a todo continu costa el gobierno socialista sigue sin trabajar con la hip tesis de la recesi n
676135 no podemos comprender a qu est n esperando para trabajar con esa hip tesis que para todos los dem s ya es una certeza pero la conclusi n a la que llegamos es que lo nico que el ejecutivo de zapatero tiene intenci n de hacer para afrontar la crisis es absolutamente nada
676136 hacer caso de las medidas econ micas que propone el pp pues a juicio del dirigente del ppcv
676137 ni el propio solbes se cree el programa electoral del psoe
676138 falta de previsi n en materia de personal y de servicios que tiene la administraci n auton mica
676139 inadmisible desde el momento en que se ha pedido la transferencia de esta competencia en su totalidad
676140 si camps quer a hacerse cargo de la sanidad deb a ser para mejorarla no para empeorarla aunque visto lo visto para lo que el camps quer a la transferencia de la sanidad era para privatizarla y beneficiar a determinadas empresas como las que se hacen cargo de las resonancias
676141 no hay m s que pedir que te atiendan en determinados servicios para que te den fecha para tres cuatro o m s meses d ndose especialidades con listas de espera de m s de un a o
676142 aun con las disminuciones de llegadas este a o las necesidades se mantienen para la poblaci n en su lugar de residencia habitual o all donde est n pero se ven incrementadas con otros ciudadanos que deciden pasar sus vacaciones en nuestras tierras
676143 responsabilidad de camps que hace o dos sordos a las reivindicaciones de sindicatos y de comprom s
676144 las enfermedades no se van de vacaciones porque camps se marche a veranear
676145 ha admitido que el programa electoral del psoe era el cuento de la lechera
676146 en lugar de contribuir a restablecer la confianza en la econom a espa ola siga azuzando con fines propagandistas con riesgo de quebrar la confianza de los agentes econ micos en la econom a espa ola
676147 ha tomado la pol tica econ mica como punto de referencia para su acci n de oposici n
676148 no da propuestas para resolver la crisis sino que se limita a propagar una crisis ficticia m s profunda de lo que es con el fin de desgastar al gobierno sin que importe el precio que nos cueste a los espa oles
676149 el pp y costa en particular est n dispuestos a arruinar a la mayor a siempre que ellos obtengan alguna ventaja
676150 no sube el presidente del pp mariano rajoy porque baje el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero ni la diferencia relativa entre las ca das compensa suficientemente para ganar unas elecciones
676151 est prisionero de una pol tica de comunicaci n que le da ganancias exiguas en corto frente a zapatero
676152 le hunden tambi n a l y al resto de espa oles
676153 de los costa y camps y resto de agazapados contra rajoy y los que abiertamente se le opusieron en el congreso de valencia y sus proleg menos pasan por arruinarnos a todos a cambio de tener ellos una ventaja en su lucha interna fraticida

676157 mejorar de esta manera la capacidad adquisitiva de las familias y contribuir a propiciar una educaci n de calidad
676158 ning n alumno pueda verse perjudicado en este proceso gradual hasta que se consiga que todos los cursos desde la educaci n primaria hasta la eso participen en el programa de gratuidad de los libros de texto

676191 it has to be rigorous because they are preparing these kids to pass the exit exam to get a diploma and to go to college

676194 review of the history of racial segregation in this country confirms that separate schooling has meant unequal schooling
676195 thus we have many good reasons to be wary of the consequences of segregation on the basis of language no matter how good the plan or how benign the intentions
676196 there is one to two hours of english language development at mainstream schools
676197 for some students that works but for others its frightening confusing and frustrating
676198 i want to study in a school that many people speak english well
676199 the united states citizens they study in different school right so its hard to speak more english in my life

676217 ja hoor dat kan maar dan moet u dat tussen 4 en 5 even doorgeven ja alleen tussen 4 en 5
676218 het kan niet anders koos ze moedig mijn zijde het duurde een paar uur maar toen had ik ook wat
676219 i am aware of that case but it is more a possibility than a real investigation
676220 there was a woman in the same river who was also chopped up but we dont know if there is any connection mainly because there is no identification of that woman
676221 its a possibility but there is no lead in that case it is a little early to jump to conclusions
676222 he confessed he cut her up and even photographed the body on his cellular phone
676223 ive had some meaningful innings in my life but with the whole situation and for the people back home its bigger than just us this victory id have to say its my best innings
676224 weve all just witnessed a very very special innings the way graeme smith came out and played was as good as ive seen anyone chase down that sort of target under that sort of pressure
676225 i knew we just needed one or two partnership i was focusing on ten runs at a time thinking lets just get close
676226 i felt we were just one wicket away if we could have got the likes of morne morkel and paul harris in on that kind of deck i felt we could have won the game
676227 theyve played better cricket than us over the three games
676228 unless you live in another country the battleground is australia for the hearts and minds
676229 if the game once again turned its back on souths you cannot tell me that john oneil and sanzar wouldnt consider offering their board a means of keeping the flame alive

676232 we knew it was not going to be easy for cristiano ronaldo to come to madrid

676235 if the game once again turned its back on souths you cannot tell me that john oneil and sanzar wouldnt consider offering their board a means of keeping the flame alive
676236 i always had faith in my team we knew we could come back as we have done it in the past there is no doubt there is enough quality in the team
676237 the 90 run start given by openers virender sehwag and gautam gambhir in the second innings was crucial then sharma and zaheer bowled brilliantly today
676238 i think 307 was a good total to chase but the loss of early wickets put us under pressure sharma has shown that questions can be asked from batsmen if you bowl in right areas
676239 they india played really good cricket as they knew it was a crucial game for them our bowlers kept us in the game but batting let us down we now need to come back strongly in the final test
676240 unless you live in another country the battleground is australia for the hearts and minds
676241 if the game once again turned its back on souths you cannot tell me that john oneil and sanzar wouldnt consider offering their board a means of keeping the flame alive
676242 he is a top player who will want to prove himself in every game i feel our fans are behind him i feel that was more disappointed love
676243 to me face to face he always told me he wants to stay at the club and it finished like that so i believe what he told me
676244 he is not going anywhere even if you come with a 747 plane full of money
676245 experience wise we are a bit short in midfield but we will see with diaby not being injured denilson being available we have quality in there
676246 we are not close to signing anybody and i will focus on the players i have if we can find someone then we will do it if not i am happy as well
676247 last year we were really really unlucky we were only four points adrift and lost only three games
676248 in two of those we were leading 1 0 until 15 minutes before the end we also got some bad injuries

676275 people who emphasized how much they wanted to bring attention to the bike shows and do promotions to bring people out to sturgis ranked higher than those who didnt show that same enthusiasm like you said a long time ago you may be trying to make the position into something its not
676276 its not just the spokes model experience that we were looking for it was the whole package of what we needed from our perspective what radio needed from theres and what the miss sturgis sponsor needed to fit their needs
676277 we took all things into consideration the head shot at the interview is what we looked at for photogenic and we all take this project very seriously

676285 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
676286 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
676287 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
676288 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
676289 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
676290 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
676291 that was a great idea i didn think of that
676292 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is
676293 i suppose if they made you a zombie that they could take away all your humanity in order to relieve you of pain put you in a coma practically
676294 its something i would want for myself and my mother and anybody else i loved
676295 i wouldnt want to make the decision for you and i hope you wouldnt want to make the decision for me
676296 i think it makes choices more difficult for people who are suffering greatly and who lose hope who are going through a great deal of pain and dont have the protection that the law gives
676297 by making this available its an additional temptation to do it that wouldnt be there otherwise
676298 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam

676303 we loved the special and thoms vision for the series combines all the things our audience wants outrageousness water cooler facts and a never before seen on tv quality
676304 we have been concerned about the continuing reports of abductions disappearances the detention of some people and reports of intimidation against the media
676305 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators

676316 i asked mayor menino how he was able to get an appointed school committee in boston
676317 given the distinct lack of interest in the school committee this election season there were only nine candidates in that falls school committee election and the importance of having educational experts on the committee given the nature of public education today i think councilor mulligans plan has merit
676318 i have serious reservations about creating a board that is not based on the public electoral process
676319 starbucks decision to go to a virtually free wi fi hotspot model is having a profound impact hotspot owners are beginning to see wi fi as a cost of doing business and an operational expense rather than as a profit center

676331 it is usual that travellers in a rush forget their luggage but not a child this never happens
676332 the consumer sentiment out there is just palpable we have to change the way people consume
676333 ok so we like to consume thats fine switch isnt here to tell you to start hugging trees and become an eco warrior although its fine if thats what youre into nah all were here to do is ask you to make little changes to the way you consume so small are these changes that you wont even notice them

676357 a lot of them are specifically coming here for the byron schools
676358 take for example byron residents are realizing significant increases with their property taxes due to their bond issues but are experiencing a decrease in population one could interpret this as potential new homeowners to byron are moving to other communities that are affordable

676361 if prices stay at these levels that could lead to some significant rearrangement of production among sectors and countries

676363 the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
676364 has effectively offset all the trade liberalization efforts of the last three decades
676365 i tell you the truth you must change and become like little children if you dont do this you will never enter the kingdom of heaven the greatest person in the kingdom of heaven is the one who makes himself humble like this child
676366 whoever accepts a child in my name accepts me if one of these little children believes in me and someone causes that child to sin then it will be very bad for that person it would be better for him to have a large stone tied around his neck and be drowned in the sea how terrible for the people of the world because of the things that cause them to sin such things will happen but how terrible for the one who causes them to happen if your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better to have only part of your body and evelasting life than to have two hands and two feet and thrown into the fire that burns forever if your eyes causes you to sin take it out and throw it away it is better to have only one eye and everlasting life than to have two eyes and thrown into the fires of hell
676367 be careful dont think these little children are worth nothing i tell you that they have angels who are always with my father in heaven

676382 een lerarenbeurs is essentieel om jonge docenten voor het onderwijs te behouden wij hebben hier in ons manifest om het beroep aantrekkelijker te maken voor gepleit
676383 al vanaf komend schooljaar krijgen leraren zelf de mogelijkheid zich te ontwikkelen in hun beroep
676384 you want me to put so here are some new rules
676385 wij begrijpen volkomen het ongeduld van leraren in zuid holland dat zij een wilde staking uitroepen zeker omdat het overleg over de inhaalslag voor het onderwijs buitengewoon traag verloopt toch zullen we als bond de uitkomst daarvan moeten afwachten
676386 het knelt op een aantal punten de werkgeversorganisaties in het onderwijs voelen weinig niets voor harde afspraken over doorstroming van leraren naar hogere functies als zij blijven lesgeven het ministerie belooft om de salarisstappen in de loopbaan terug te brengen van achttien nu naar vijftien en dan nog weer naar twaalf het idee is prima maar alleen voor die eerste stap van 18 naar 15 is echt geld beschikbaar tenslotte wil het ministerie op een onaanvaardbare manier bezuinigen op de regeling voor oudere docenten om minder lessen per week te hoeven geven
676387 remember when you point at someone there is one finger pointing at you and three fingers pointing back at yourself which is why i always point with all of my fingers
676388 yeah but on the other hand we could really use the air
676389 i used to go two or three times a week after work but now i just stay at home and go once every now and again
676390 i do more drinking at home now than at the pubs theyre more for special occasions since its becoming so expensive
676391 brewing is a major industry beer our national drink and pubs a treasured part of our national culture
676392 sadly the trade repeatedly shows that it cannot be relied upon to consistently act in a responsible way
676393 theyre increasingly more friendly to families the quality of the food has increased
676394 you have to decide either be trampled under hamas shoes or stand in dignity
676395 about 52 000 german civilians mostly children perished in various camps in yugoslavia between 1945 and 1947
676396 were not counting german soldiers just innocent civilians who had in no way participated in the occupation
676397 most of those buried at this site were children and there can be no harm in marking their grave
676398 the old falsified history is now being corrected under a democratic government
676399 they have never been in the focus of public attention because in comparison with numbers expelled from elsewhere their total is not very high
676400 but that doesnt mean im afraid to use my 45 dont underestimate me just because im a woman
676401 the numbers continue to grow in spite of the violence were witnessing
676402 certainly few women have the chance to become queen kingpins
676403 yet their mere existence may serve as a role model and symbols of female power for common women in the drug trade or those considering such a career
676404 were definitely seeing more women and were seeing them playing a more important role
676405 they have other skills to influence rivals theyre more persuasive and more organized about their activities whether money laundering or running their own operations
676406 as many of the current female smugglers look to her as a successful role model
676407 everyone talked about la nacha and so in a way la nacha and my aunt became my role models into a different more adventurous life
676408 the key is not to let any male dominate you either in bed or in the heart its all business
676409 at least thats my philosophy and one that i believe has kept me alive all these years
676410 it was a very difficult life not as pretty as was described to me
676411 sul campo si era ormai diffusa la tiepida luce della luna
676412 c credo di s zio ma non ti preoccupare ora tutto a posto vedrai che adesso mi riaddormento subito

676416 most of the things i do are just like the able bodied athletes i have no problem in the water
676417 normally you have your legs kicking side to side i kind of shift mine from where it should be to a little bit so it kind of balances me in the water
676418 i know nothing else this is what im used to this is how i live my life you know im used to it
676419 i just think its a great honor to go and represent my country and to go over there to compete and see what i can do thats really what im all about
676420 im really excited to represent the united states and hopefully do well there
676421 ive just gotten used to it i ignore it when i swim so it doesnt really bother me it just floats along for the ride
676422 when jarrett was born i didnt think he would ever walk so for him to have made it this far i am shocked
676423 we are very excited and very proud i have to say its just kind of an overwhelming process for us right now
676424 i am not an athenian or a greek but a citizen of the world
676425 not to be absolutely certain is i think one of the essential things in rationality

676531 congratulations to heikki kovalainen for scoring his first grand prix win and also to timo glock for achieving his first f1 podium finish especially after his accident in the last race
676532 performance from both compounds was good and the super soft was faster when we saw more rubber laid on the track as we saw from kimi raikkonens fastest lap
676533 congratulations to heikki for his first and very well deserved grand prix win the race could have been better for me my start was okay but felipes was better and he managed to overtake me i managed to maintain the gap during the first stint and felt comfortable in the second stint because i was matching his times but was going to be running longer to the final stops i feel i could have had a go at passing him but the damaged tyre halted my progress i dont yet know what happened but at least i scored four points and maintained my lead in the championship so this result is not too bad for me
676534 one of the oldest motor racing phrases ever coined is to finish first first you have to finish
676535 lewiss race was compromised by his losing the lead at the start but we fuelled him long for the second stint and therefore believed he was well placed to leapfrog felipe in his final pitstop sadly for him though it wasnt to be damage to his front left tyre cost him that victory chance however from lewiss perspective as bad days go it could have been a lot worse but today was heikkis day and a very good day it was and everyone at vodafone mclaren mercedes is absolutely delighted for him
676536 a couple of things would ring a bell with people
676537 it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
676538 i didnt have a very good pit stop and that caused the engine to overheat and that messed up some parts and i had no choice but to retire its a shame as i had a good pace from the car this afternoon i made a mistake in running wide at the last corner on the first lap and lost a lot of places i was stuck behind barrichello and it was impossible to overtake this hasnt been a good weekend and that goes back to friday when i suffered reliability problems and then came the disappointment this afternoon
676539 there can be no excuses this was a bad weekend for the whole team
676540 there have been two sides to this weekend it got off to a good start and then i had some problems in qualifying
676541 the race also started quite well as i had a good pace then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor
676542 it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing so had to make another stop to get it cleaned
676543 by this stage we had lost so much time there was nothing else to do and i preferred to make the extra stop as the lack of visibility was dangerous
676544 i didnt have a very good pitstop and that caused the engine to overheat and that messed up some parts and i had no choice but to retire
676545 its a shame as i had a good pace from the car this afternoon
676546 considering this my race pace was not bad in the first stint but then in the second stint i was held up by the group in front when i was quite light and lost some time there in the final stint i had a puncture on the front right under braking and then the brakes gave up and my race was over overall i am disappointed because weve worked hard for the whole weekend and then after three laps we have a problem so i couldnt show the performance i wanted to
676547 it was a tough race as we were fighting quite a lot we were quite heavy at the beginning of the race but the pace really wasnt too bad and i could keep up with the others in front of me in fact the two williams were only two laps heavier than me when i was just behind them but i was keeping the same pace even at the end of the race in the last few laps i could do a 1min 22 6 which is a good lap time in terms of strategy we did well that was the maximum we could get from this race we just need a step forward for the next few races
676548 an exciting race for our guys with both driving very good races under the circumstances
676549 adrian had a brake problem very early on which meant we had to wind his brake balance forward and ultimately he had to stop with a puncture caused by this brake failure while its disappointing not to get two cars to the finish we can be pleased with the teams performance and both the drivers who all pushed very hard this weekend
676550 i think we can be pleased with the teams performance this weekend
676551 i had a really good car and everything went perfectly until the last stint on the soft tyres i was struggling a lot and soon i had kimi behind me but i knew from last year here in gp2 when i was stuck in the midfield in a really good car how hard it is to pass here so when i saw him in the mirrors i knew i couldnt afford any mistakes this result more than makes up for hockenheim and now we must keep picking up regular points until the end of the season
676552 this is a very good result for us and to pick up ten points is great for the constructors championship
676553 i gained one position early on but overtaking is practically impossible here around the second stops i was also stuck behind lewis holding me up further still im delighted that we are showing such strong form and i just hope we can carry on in good shape and with such good results
676554 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result the best of our season
676555 i am happy with my result this weekend i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
676556 todays result is a solid and encouraging one for the whole team our two drivers did a great job and we are now ready to continue pushing hard in the second half of the season to finish in fourth place in the constructors championship
676557 we fought hard today and we were on the pace with a car that was working well which is encouraging for the rest of the championship
676558 we scored some important points which is satisfying even though we could have maybe been on the podium we must now continue working hard but todays result shows that we are moving in the right direction
676559 i scored some valuable points which is promising for the rest of the season i made a good start but unfortunately i made a small mistake on the first lap which meant that i lost the two positions that i had made up
676560 it shows that at this level you cannot afford to make the smallest error i am continuing to learn and i am determined to continue building on this progress when we go to valencia at the end of the month
676561 my start wasnt perfect but okay as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse todays lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
676562 we were completely off the pace during the race neither driver was able to do the lap times we expected after the sessions on friday and saturday it was the same on both tyre compounds the reason for that is currently not clear but we shall analyse everything congratulations to heikki kovalainen for his maiden win in f1 and of course timo glock for his strong weekend crowned by finishing second
676563 neither driver was able to do the lap times we expected after the sessions on friday and saturday it was the same on both tyre compounds
676564 the reason for that is currently not clear but we shall analyse everything
676565 this was a difficult race we were very slow and i was struggling with the overall grip of the car i had massive oversteer and could not really push i was trying hard to keep the car on the track anyway one point is better than nothing
676566 i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
676567 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me
676568 after that my race was effectively over as the number of blue flags made it impossible to make progress we decided to drop the revs on the engine and do some testing with the tyres as we had overheating problems over the weekend and it was good to collect some data on this for me the actual race was one to forget really
676569 todays race was never going to be easy from our grid positions from the first lap both drivers were held up by heidfeld who was running on a different strategy and this prevented them from using their true pace the new developments that we brought to hungary have definitely helped us to improve the performance of the car as is always the case though the rest of the field isnt standing still and we do not yet have the pace to score points on our own merit
676570 we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship
676571 lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
676572 we werent quick enough we didnt do a good enough job in qualifying yesterday which hurt us in the race we struggled to find pace and it was hard to stay with the toyotas and renaults who were fighting in the championship lets hope its this track though and that we can bounce back in valencia
676573 unfortunately i got some traffic before my last stop which allowed nick heidfeld to pass me otherwise i couldnt do anymore today the car has a lot of oversteer and rear sliding now well just focus on the next race and see that we can do there
676574 a disappointing race unfortunately we just werent fast enough and it was a circuit that didnt play to our strengths our nearest rivals both had respectable scores today but well be pushing hard to recover lost ground in the remaining races
676575 looking at the weekend as a whole we have made good progress and can take a lot away from here
676576 unfortunately the race was frustrating i made it tough for myself with a poor start which dropped me down to p14 after the first couple of corners i got boxed in at turn 1 and had a lot of wheelspin out of the corner which allowed a few people to get past on the outside
676577 i was able to get past rubens on lap three which was fun but after that i quickly came up to the back of heidfeld he was very strong on the last two corners so i had no chance to overtake on the track and he was on a one stop strategy
676578 however in clean air our pace was good so this weekend is a definite step forward and i am reasonably happy with the outcome
676579 after a good start where i made up four positions on the opening lap unfortunately it wasnt a very exciting race for me
676580 we decided to start with used front and new rear tyres which proved to be a problem as the car was out of balance for the first stint
676581 then at my first pitstop we were unlucky to have the problem with the rig which resulted in a small fire and a long delay whilst we got fuel into the car using the second rig

676872 however a large number of prior reports have demonstrated that because of issues of social instability related to illicit drug addiction hiv infected idus may not be deriving the full benefits of haart
676873 although our findings cannot be generalized outside of this cohort as efforts to improve use of haart among idus expand the fact that survival patterns were not significantly different between idus and non idus should help to challenge the increasingly prevalent belief that idus may be markedly less likely to benefit from haart based on these results we conclude that haart regimens may have effectiveness at a populational level that is not significantly different regarding the survival of individuals with and without a history of injection drug use
676874 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
676875 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
676876 for a disease that has been transformed from almost uniformly fatal to manageable over decades the impact of treatment decisions is substantial
676877 disease management remains challenged by toxicities maintenance of adherence clinical manifestations related to both the drugs and the hiv infection itself and the threat of drug resistance sustainability and expansion of the progress achieved will depend on maintaining a robust drug development pipeline and the ability to deliver effective therapy and monitoring tools to the worlds affected populations
676878 with creativity and political will the progress and individualized approach to antiretroviral therapy evident in the developed world can be adapted to the public health approach in the developing world where 90 percent of the worlds hiv infected population lives
676879 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
676880 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve
676881 growth hormone is not yet fda approved for the treatment of abdominal fat accumulation in patients with hiv other more potent strategies to safely increase gh and reduce vat including the use of gh releasing hormone ghrh may be more beneficial in addition strategies using diet exercise and lifestyle change may be more cost effective in the long run than gh particularly in patients with hiv visceral adiposity and insulin resistance in whom changes in glucose may be counterproductive

676887 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
676888 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either
676889 if i let my daughter go to live with her uncle he may sell her to someone i will never let him sell her
676890 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
676891 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
676892 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet
676893 there is no open place for them to play there is no park they are living with their mothers inside the prison in the room
676894 if a child is breastfeeding it is necessary to be with the mother but there are some children who are 10 11 13
676895 if i go outside i can help my sister cook and wash the clothes i can study go to the mosque study the quran and when i come home i can help my sister wash the dishes
676896 i cant let my children be taken to an orphanage because i have many enemies who may kidnap them
676897 some of my enemies are even in prison and they ask about me if my children were in an orphanage i would not feel that they were safe

676912 in fact they are more specialized for running than almost any other animal
676913 these two birds have relatively the largest total hind limb extensor muscles yet recorded for any tetrapod four legged animal
676914 of the emu which devotes almost one third of its entire body mass bones and all to leg extensor muscles
676915 africa was really quite isolated even for flying birds for a substantial period of time thus even if ratites were still flying birds in the late cretaceous about 80 million years ago they were stuck on the african ship once it left the dock
676916 like specialization for flying extreme specialization for running or anything else tends to make animals look the same if they started with the same body plan

676921 it is not the unknown that we fear it is the leaving behind of the known that we fear
676922 because they benefit the rich the rich get much more money back than ordinary taxpayers like you and i and thats not fair

676927 up until fairly recently we just havent had enough on the service for non english speaking folks in france for example weve only recently started to get figures where youve got enough french speaking folks getting a rich enough experience to talk about it meaningfully to their friends
676928 speaking with mcv during e3 a couple of weeks back microsofts john shappert has revealed that of all paid downloads on their xbox live service 1 3 of them are for tv show or movie downloads on the consoles video marketplace so what does that actually mean we dont know though we guess it shows the service is a lot more popular than most people figured that or it shows how big a proportion of the 360s install base is american what with the woeful state of everyone elses video marketplaces

676938 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea of his name and his race is a lie
676939 there is no doubt in my mind that sen obama is trying to suggest that he is the victim of something
676940 not looking like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
676941 to say that that is not trying to inject the idea that you are a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
676942 what he was saying all along is that he has a different kind of resume

676944 given the seriousness of the subject of food security we have felt that it deserves to be addressed through a special statement
676945 we direct that the saarc food bank be urgently operationalized
676946 we further direct that saarc region should forge greater cooperation with the international community to ensure food availability and nutrition security in south asia
676947 our vulnerability to these shocks is more than that of many other countries
676948 the escalation of oil prices threatens both the energy security of the region as well as the economic growth
676949 south asia cannot progress unless there is stability and security throughout the region
676950 they emphasized the need for strongest possible cooperation inthe fight against terrorism and trans national organized crime amongst the relevant agencies of the member states especially in the area of information exchange
676951 they dont want to give the impression that somehow they have lost their concern over inflation that would be fatal
676952 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
676953 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbors
676954 we need to start getting young people involved in leadership again in hiv and aids because its easy to get kind of complacent
676955 i want to congratulate all the boys and girls who have graduated and got good grades
676956 sometimes i have so much fun that i forget i have this

676960 we welcome this move because it helps to reclaim the nations flag from the narrow nationalism represented by the snp the saltire and the lion rampant are for all of scotland not just people who want independence it is similar to the union jack being reclaimed from the bnp as a sign of patriotism not nationalism
676961 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but he did not endorse he did not come out with a strong decision

676976 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
676977 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
676978 daschle said the fbi has not given him any new updates he also raised questions about the quality of the investigation noting that the government recently paid out almost 6 million to a former army scientist steven hatfill who accused authorities of unfairly targeting him in the anthrax case

676982 this is the way they work from providing medical services to religious services to even soccer teams
676983 if the government doesnt give enough money for sports activities or sports facilities they will construct them by donations and provide the services by so doing they will attract particularly the poor those that dont have enough money to pay
676984 if the government doesnt build a hospital here there is a vacuum
676985 this allows the islamic movement to come here and build hospitals take the credit provide the service and connect to the people
676986 the islamic movement gathered money here to pay for teachers and to clean the streets and people started trusting them
676987 the main goal of the islamic movement is to bring people to the best situation here in education in ethics
676988 they are struggling in the same political field as the islamic movement
676989 they still know their situation is better than elsewhere in the arab world
676990 where the israeli government is neglecting or failing to set lines and limits they go in and do whatever they can in support of their ideology until someone wakes up and says we have to show them the limits of laws
676991 pension reform can be politically difficult but the experience of the oecd countries over the past 10 15 years suggests that obstacles to pension reform are not insuperable more than half of oecd countries have had major changes over that time
676992 more candid personal artistic and flattering there were few artistic photos of mccain most were traditional campaign shots
676993 the disparity in the numbers is indeed hard to reconcile as photojournalists we always strive to be fair we have tried to be balanced but it seems that in a large operation such as ours we need to monitor the use of political images even more closely
676994 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
676995 it certainly has not been abused it may be underutilized
676996 in every case i was involved in i thought it was an abuse
676997 we dont know how many guns were actually confiscated or returned to their owners

677004 no state shall pass any bill of attainder ex post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contracts
677005 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
677006 obama still leads by 1 point today 47 46 in rasmussens daily poll last sunday he was leading by 6 sorry obambi too bad

677012 that were seeing out of the mccain campaign the republican party and some of their allies have been some very aggressive charges
677013 i dont think anything that went on in these chambers affected him
677014 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings
677015 things go on inside mccains head that rarely or never come out

677019 it is difficult enough for journalists to convince reluctant sources to submit to rigorous interviews
677020 it is even more challenging when the sources suspect that journalists may be investigative arms of the government
677021 the press might well decide to avoid certain controversial subjects or subjects likely to lead to criminal prosecutions
677022 protection is essential to the effective functioning of the press

677024 the judge said he thought it was a fishing expedition and he was right
677025 this was a 26 minute interview and if they had anything particularly outrageous it would have been aired if word went out that 60 minutes would turn over its outtakes no one would ever talk to them and the public would lose because information would start to dry up
677026 thats why we feel the lower court has lost its way
677027 civilian courts have had no difficulty applying these principles to quash subpoenas to journalists particularly where the subpoenaing party is merely speculating about the value of the materials it seeks

677037 we received a call from someone claiming to work for vital records saying that he can provide obama with an image copy of his original birth certificate all he has to do is fill out the form being faxing to you sign it and fax or mail it back
677038 it sure looked like obamas original certification of live birth janice okubo also thought that it looked like an original colb i still think this a real colb image youre saying that it could have been faked but it has all of the original information why would anyone do that

677056 has been forensically diagnosed by several top psychiatrists as a sociopathic homicidal killer i have that in evidence and through my working with him i also believe that to be very true
677057 he very calmly thanked me for ruining his life and opening allowing the fbi to now be able to prosecute him for the murders and that it was all my fault and its going to be my fault that they can now get him

677105 i am saddened that the alp has decided to remove from the people of lyne the right to vote labor labor has contested lyne for as long as anyone can recall
677106 because our two party system is so controlled by spin and media hype labor will not risk losing even in a seat it has never won

677109 she is deserted by her de facto husband who earns half a million dollars a year currently the court looks only at her contribution during the past 20 years rather than her future financial needs in the division of property that is not the case with a married woman

677124 the assumptions on which the organization has been built and is being run no longer fit reality
677125 there is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all

677128 thanks very much for your input ive decided to go ahead with plan b
677129 stephanie i want to talk with you about what happened at last fridays meeting
677130 likewise when youre unhappy with a plan ive announced i need you to ask me if im open to further discussion if i have time and am willing to open the topic with you then we can talk privately if i dont have time and i feel that i have sufficient input to move ahead ill let you know but once my decision is final its critical that you support it and me
677131 i think youre a great asset i value your work and your thinking on a large number of important issues this feedback that im giving you is going to be important for you to integrate into your thinking as you continue in your career if anything im saying is unclear or you want to talk about it at a later point let me know you have a lot to offer our clients and the company and this communication issue is getting in the way of your doing that
677132 the total amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation during the minute it takes me to say these words thousands of animals are running for their lives whimpering with fear feeling teeth sink into their throats thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within there is no central authority no safety net for most animals the reality of life is struggling suffering and death
677133 it is a truism that almost any sect cult or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so
677134 it is a telling fact that the world over the vast majority of children follow the religion of their parents rather than any of the other available religions
677135 i am patient with stupidity but not with those who are proud of it
677136 youre basically killing each other to see whos got the better imaginary friend
677137 this phenomenon has not been really taken into account yet and we need to explore and understand it
677138 all those who stood against iran over the past years have now reached a conviction that in this issue there is no other way but to involve into dialogue and consultation
677139 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
677140 great things are not done by impulse but by a series of small things brought together
677141 a lot of people are afraid to say what they want thats why they dont get what they want
677142 i tought you were going to give me a quest
677143 i seek a piece of the map to the island of crandor
677144 its not my role nor that of anyone else other than the members of the chiefly vatuwaqa of the vuanirewa clan family to speak on who the next tui nayau will be
677145 all im concern about is the likely implications of their choice to the unity of the province
677146 as shown in the funeral of ratu mara strict protocol was not observed on several matters which caused great pain and hurt amongst the masi chiefs of lau and their people
677147 as far back as i could recall there usually is only three main seats in the alofi when lau meets
677148 you only have the tui nayau at the apex the sau kei mualevu below him to his right and the sau kei totoya to his left
677149 so only three cups of kava are served in the ceremony with the threes respective matanivanua heralds drinking as well
677150 i can understand what the sau kei mualevu is saying and he is right
677151 if stis are common this suggests a greater risk for the spread of hiv because the activities or behaviours which spread stis are the same as those which spread hiv
677152 as well the presence of an sti facilitates hiv transmission so to access vulnerability we need only ask ourselves are stis common
677153 lack of political will is leading to lots of denial and many still do today
677154 there has been some response from the national government but support in terms of funding is sadly lacking
677155 hiv is now reported from all provinces in png since march 2003 just some three years ago some of these provinces were un touched by the epidemic
677156 aids related death is the leading cause of death in the medical wards of port moresby general hospital the biggest hospital in the country
677157 an increasing number of people now admit of knowing someone theyve been close to who has died or is infected and affected by hiv aids
677158 we would need national government commitment to support funding the national response development of relevant sectoral policies and mainstreaming of hiv aids also need to be addressed
677159 the savusavu tourism association is very proud to be the owners and hosts of the south pacific world music festival the event started over thanksgiving 2004 and will continue to be held here in savusavu for the next 4 years may be longer
677160 politically there will be a huge uproar if a less than fair system is used
677161 its completely unacceptable for two or three countries to dominate the irb it has become a pretty exclusive lot and the sad thing is theres no sign of this changing
677162 its amazing that the major countries in the irb are the pillars of democracy and its values are being promoted in education business etc but in rugby they practice differently
677163 democratic principles always work out over positions of privilege how does this change come about is the question democratic fifa for all its faults has made their game really global especially to africa and most recently asia
677164 theres a lot of frustrations as no one seem interested in looking at our unique problems and what we now have is these very least resourced unions with the smallest of voices fast becoming the third tier of rugby nations
677165 the chairman of irb dr syd millar took it on himself to establish this special working party to include the most influential people on irb to look at the problems facing the second tier nations including the 3 pacific islands unions
677166 of course our interests would be better served if we were represented these committee members have been members of the council for some years with little support coming to the pacific i am not sure how they would have full appreciation of our needs but i do feel that they would have a good understanding of what is feasible by way of solutions
677167 i think there is an understanding of the problem but i do not think there had been the collective will to do anything about it this committee may have the necessary drive if they can focus only on the problem
677168 the gap between the wealthy unions and the poorer unions is widening and the irb will have to do something about that
677169 its not just a rugby thing its a very complex job as you are dealing with different economies
677170 we have a major issue confronting us now which is this gap between the rich and the poor and we are reading a lot of emotional statements at the moment some of which i think are more down the propaganda line than are necessarily aligned with fact
677171 i think post world cup we need to get fact based information on the table then deliberately and very determined ensure that going into world cup 2007 to the greatest extent possible that gap is closed
677172 this shows that some countries are more equal than others
677173 we have to generate money for rugby football in general and of course tv requires top matches at certain times so we have to be aware of that the format and structure of the tournament sometimes has to reflect that
677174 its something that again we have to address and look at its nearly impossible to please everyone
677175 the truth is new zealand and australia did not represent our interest as we would have like them to be
677176 its only in the last two years that the restructure of the three unions were in progress and the new leadership in fiji samoa and tonga pursue our rugby at the highest level i believe that our approach compliment each other because we have common advantages and weaknesses
677177 they have spoken out in the past but do our interests coincide
677178 we must do everything to get attention but not at a cost of becoming complaining whingers it is a very fine line and our detractors will use that skilfully against us we do have some detractors in high places
677179 samoa like fiji and tonga are a very proud rugby playing nation and i expect will do everything possible to be at the next world cup in 2007 even if we are not competitive
677180 he wouldnt want to wait for another four years for things to happen
677181 my own vision of what will happen to island rugby is not an optimistic one i can only pray that i am wrong and those with influence can reverse or at least stem the flow of the drain on pacific rugby new zealand have announced eligibility criteria for their npc and we have already been kicked out of the super 12 if we are dying the only consolation is that it will only be a matter of time for others even new zealand
677182 we have taken the first step as an observer in the council as well as members of two irb committees age group rugby and womens rugby
677183 we have initiated the pacific islanders team which will take the field for the first time next year with the support of the irb and sanzar
677184 i strongly believe that we have one foot inside the irb door we need to engage them rather than withdraw and do nothing
677185 nobody at the irb level disagrees that we needed help we need to prove to the irb that we can take care of our own affairs at home
677186 we have apologised to god we have apologised to the church
677187 but we have never said sorry to the family of the talatala man of god that my forefathers killed on this soil that i now stand
677188 the past is the past and we need to move ahead to the future i feel that the spirit of thomas baker is at rest
677189 he did not confide to his wife the risky journey he was contemplating he did not consider the feelings and opinions of those he took with him and in that sense baker was responsible for the loss of seven other loyal christian men he placed himself beyond the bounds of common sense deluded by a false sense of security and an exaggerated opinion of his own achievements
677190 i would never want to go back on welfare i believe in working but i look at my bills and i look at how i was doing when i was getting help and i cant help but notice that there isnt much difference
677191 we recognize that its a small stipend but its something to help adjust to life in the workforce
677192 its harder to find a job its harder to sell houses its a scary time
677193 im coming back tomorrow for the back to school shopping
677194 an evolving draft document and doesnt reflect final estimates cost savings or allocations
677195 the experience of dcps stakeholders will be dramatically different in five years
677196 we have the organizational ability and the financial ability to compete there
677197 some of the old givens are no longer true its not how it was 20 years ago or even 10 years ago
677198 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
677199 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
677200 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
677201 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side
677202 it would mean a lot especially here on the eastern shore
677203 a lot of these boys are barely hanging on delawares got all the money their purses are humongous compared to here
677204 i decided whatever im living in now im happy in
677205 there are some groups that are going to be here just because this is a big stage
677206 but i think the majority of groups are here because they really want to demonstrate to the delegates that they want to see some sort of changes in the party platform
677207 these groups have said we cant survive four more years of this
677208 it is something that really gets people out in the streets
677209 its not directed specifically against the republicans thats for certain
677210 its against the warmakers but even people marching dont necessarily have to see things as broadly as i do
677211 im meeting with the chef and going over the new menu right now
677212 panther family fun center was a blast my son had his ninth birthday party there
677213 i started washing dishes standing on a remington shotgun shell box

677215 we are asking for a one year stay so we can look at what has happened with alternative energy and other things
677216 i dont think people realize the significance of what we are doing when we build this stuff
677217 weve been fighting for information on why the postal facility didnt shut down like capitol hill
677218 the labor department set up a center for workmans compensation claims from 9 11 we never had that

677230 il caso chiuso adrian resta a firenze sono bastati cinque minuti di colloquio lui ha capito limportanza del nostro progetto e ha ribadito il suo attaccamento alla maglia viola non abbiamo parlato oggi dei dettagli del nuovo contratto tutto questo verr trattato da luned dal nostro direttore sportivo che giustamente dato il ruolo ha dovuto ascoltare lofferta della roma ma lultima decisione spetta a me spetta alla propriet forse c stato qualche malinteso ma a me il giocatore non ha mai detto di voler andare via
677231 ci era stato detto che a certe condizioni la trattativa si poteva fare queste determinate condizioni sono state accettate e portate in fondo se mutu non viene alla roma non certo colpa della nostra societ a questo punto ritengo la trattativa chiusa una volta per tutte aquilani per quanto mi riguarda rimane
677232 il giocatore non sul mercato ha detto il suo procuratore federico pastorello non c speranza che il ragazzo possa tornare in italia anche perch il villarreal lo ha dichiarato pi volte incedibile in passato non c mai stato nessun contatto tra la roma e la societ spagnola poi alla fine dellanno si tireranno le somme e vedremo

677236 then well be a little less hot wednesday through saturday highs in the upper 90s
677237 in this drought condition fires will happen it is up to people to practice caution and to be aware of how their everyday actions can accidentally start a fire
677238 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
677239 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
677240 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
677241 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
677242 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
677243 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
677244 they dont want to give the impression that somehow they have lost their concern over inflation that would be fatal

677255 the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased

677262 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
677263 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist i think they are cynical
677264 their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
677265 were glad the obama campaign retracted barack obamas accusation because it was absolutely false and were moving on
677266 none of you thought i was making a racially incendiary remark or playing the race card
677267 it wasnt until john mccains team started pushing it that it ended up being on the front page of the new york times two days in a row
677268 we face serious issues in this election and have real differences
677269 im not going to assault sen mccains character im not going to compare him to pop stars
677270 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
677271 senator obama says he wants energy independence but he doesnt support anything that serves that goal he is opposed to new domestic drilling opposed to nuclear power and wants to add taxes to coal producers
677272 im really pleased for our first time out that we got this win against a very good team
677273 we did know coming in that latvia was going to be a very good opponent having watched them beat russia last night and having seen them play in the olympic qualifier
677274 we can play better and we tend to play better as we go but we certainly got all we could handle from latvia
677275 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
677276 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
677277 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
677278 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
677279 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
677280 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
677281 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
677282 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
677283 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
677284 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
677285 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
677286 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested
677287 there seems to be a willingness to say ok ive got suspicions this may be happening but now lets play the game and see who wins
677288 i follow with deep friendship this great sporting event the most important and awaited on a world level and i wish that it offer the international community a valid example of coexistence among people of different background in the respect of common dignity
677289 each can give their best in the true olympic spirit
677290 to go back into my past and at the same time walk toward the future
677291 the allegiance of first nations and environmental organizations over the past 25 to 30 years has frankly been a bit of an uneasy one
677292 you know it hasnt always been one where there is an absolute congruent goal i think what that relationship has been historically based on is a common agenda of seeking environmental justice and social justice

677328 twenty years ago 21 of oil contracts were purchased by speculators who trade oil on paper with no intention of ever taking delivery today oil speculators purchase 66 of all oil futures contracts and that reflects just the transactions that are known speculators buy up large amounts of oil and then sell it to each other again and again a barrel of oil may trade 20 plus times before it is delivered and used the price goes up with each trade and consumers pick up the final tab some market experts estimate that current prices reflect as much as 30 to 60 per barrel in unnecessary speculative costs

677340 id like to congratulate the 16 nations involved in sea breeze 2008 on an extremely well planned and conducted exercise
677341 everyone participating in this exercise should be very proud of the level of interoperability and cooperation that was achieved among the sea air and land components as well as among nations

677343 we look forward to next yearr s exercise and i personally invite everyone here back for sea breeze 2009

677351 given the success of the historic maq t20 international cricket tournament we believe that south florida possesses the amenities good year round weather and a diverse population that will enable the area to become the hub of cricket in the united states
677352 i didnt think the match would have been over today i thought we could give india a better fight
677353 i didnt think the match would have been over today i thought we could give india a better fight
677354 we fought every time we were down we fought very well to come back into this test match to get six wickets this morning in quick time and restricting india to 269 was a brilliant effort that gave us a good opportunity to chase these runs down
677355 its important we get a good start in any run chase
677356 we didnt get it and being down 10 for 3 wasnt ideal
677357 the bowling unit fought really well throughout the test and created opportunities for us and kept the indians under control
677358 the disappointment was in the first innings where we should have capitalised and put more pressure on the indians
677359 we should have got a few more runs on the board we played really good cricket for two to three days and we just lost it in the last two sessions of the fourth day
677360 a quick bowler like ishant is something for us to discuss ishant is an exceptional bowler
677361 he creates a bit of bounce on these kinds of wickets thats something which india has
677362 well have a chat with the selectors we have a few options in our squad and see what we can come up with
677363 going into the fourth day or fifth day of a test match you always know that when you have to face two top class spinners the mindset would be there but we always knew that the new ball is always going to be a factor on these kinds of wickets
677364 thats where you probably can pick up a couple of wickets thilan samaraweera showed a lot of character to hang around there and batted well but it was a bit too much for him in the end
677365 i am very happy for ajantha in his second test match to pick up ten wickets he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well
677366 the last game was brilliant we got 600 runs one game you have a bad run you just cant point fingers and say this is bad
677367 it is just that we need to figure out a way of controlling situations a bit better especially under pressure and see how we can come out of it

677421 exercised by them the advanced nations as mandatories on behalf of the league

677426 nothing in this chapter shall be construed in or of itself to alter in any manner the terms of existing international instruments to which members of the united nations may respectively be parties
677427 does not affect any right obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination
677428 the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies
677429 this territory was not occupied in the sense of the geneva convention since those rules are designed to assure the reversion of the former legitimate sovereign which in this case does not exist
677430 had not been taken from a legitimate sovereign the fourth geneva convention and the hague regulations 1889 1907 were inapplicable there
677431 the convention applies only to acts by one signatory carried out on the territory of another the west bank is not the territory of a signatory power but an unallocated part of the british mandate the controversy about jewish settlements in the west bank is not therefore about legal rights but about the political will to override legal rights
677432 resulted in a lapse or vacancy of internationally recognized sovereignty the west bank was in legal jargon res nullius a thing belonging to no state
677433 sovereignty in international law may be acquired by any state in a position to assert effective and stable control without resort to unlawful means
677434 that israels presence in the territory constitutes an occupation is utterly specious
677435 the expulsion or murder of much of israels jewish inhabitants in 1967

677454 a large majority of the public believes that healthy young adult sleep is an unbroken deep sleep
677455 therefore public education about the normality of light sleep phases and awakenings may be protective against the development of insomnia
677456 it can also be part of the education and cognitive therapy component for insomnia treatment

677458 we thought it was important to get an accurate opinion of australians views towards president bush
677459 and whether they agree with former president jimmy carter that george w bush was actually the worst president of us history
677460 the result was there is a clear majority of australians who believe george w bush is the worst and that is based primarily on his iraq war policy
677461 george bush is not representing american views these days as over 60 per cent of americans disagree with his policy in the iraq war
677462 every time we are disturbed no matter what the cause there is something wrong with us no matter how unreasonable others may seem i am responsible for not reacting negatively regardless of what is happening around me i will always have the perogative and the responsibility of choosing what happens within me i am the creator of my own reality when i review my day i know that i must stop judging others if i judge others i am probably judging myself whoever is upsetting me most is my best teacher i have much to learn from him or her and in my hearts i should thank that person

677490 mijn hartspier moest blijkbaar nog wakker worden want het eerste half uur was het aantal slagen per minuut net iets te hoog 120 beats na een half uurtje zakte hij mooi tot rond 117
677491 ik wilde echt zo lang mogelijk in een lage hartslag blijven lopen met voldoende eten en drinken wat me vooral opvalt is de hoeveelheid trampolines die tegenwoordig bij boerderijen staan er is vrijwel geen koe meer te bekennen maar die zwarte schotels staan op vrijwel ieder erf
677492 ik zag het ook plots was de hartslag 127 ik heb toen het tempo wat laten zakken maar telkens zat ik weer op 127 eigenlijk liep dat wel lekker en dat tempo heb ik aangehouden tot 4 uur wedstrijd
677493 ik wilde de wedstrijd afsluiten in een hoger tempo en een muziekje erbij is dan erg lekker ondanks de 4 uur inspanning ging dit opvallend makkelijk en met een hartslag van 150 155 heb ik de route verder uitgelopen wel werd het plots erg warm maar dat was in dit stadium niet meer zo erg

677546 fighting for the recognition of dr martin luther kings birthday in my state
677547 on the martin luther king issue we all learn ok we all learn i will admit to learning and i hope that the people that i represent appreciate that too i voted in 1983 against the recognition of martin luther king i regret that vote

677549 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
677550 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
677551 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
677552 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
677553 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
677554 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
677555 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
677556 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
677557 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
677558 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
677559 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
677560 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
677561 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
677562 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
677563 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
677564 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
677565 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
677566 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
677567 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
677568 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
677569 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
677570 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
677571 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
677572 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
677573 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
677574 who are open to doing something on the production side
677575 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
677576 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
677577 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
677578 relatives often work harder for less money and are more loyal because they have a personal stake in the organizations success

677580 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
677581 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
677582 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
677583 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
677584 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
677585 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
677586 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
677587 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
677588 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
677589 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
677590 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
677591 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
677592 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
677593 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
677594 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
677595 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
677596 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
677597 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
677598 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
677599 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
677600 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
677601 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
677602 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
677603 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
677604 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
677605 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
677606 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
677607 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
677608 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
677609 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
677610 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
677611 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
677612 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
677613 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
677614 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
677615 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
677616 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
677617 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
677618 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
677619 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
677620 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
677621 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
677622 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
677623 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
677624 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
677625 bueno pruebo en una estaci n de sevicio a ver si cargo
677626 disculpe hay alg n lugar donde se pueda cargar aire

677630 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
677631 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
677632 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
677633 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
677634 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
677635 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
677636 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
677637 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
677638 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
677639 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
677640 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
677641 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
677642 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
677643 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
677644 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
677645 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
677646 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

677658 what that does for us it puts a strain on our system where were unable to provide adequate care for our own citizens
677659 i can think of three different scenarios that would have led to a fatal outcome if they had moved her
677660 the good outcome today is due to the treatment that the hospital provided reluctantly and sadly enough only in response to legal and public pressure
677661 the couple of days afterwards what if goes through your head that i could have been us open champion
677662 at the same time you cant let yourself dwell on those kind of emotions and youve got to turn the positives out i played great under pressure and nearly won a major
677663 im not worried about not winning im just delighted about the consistency
677664 i know that winning is very fickle i went three years without winning and then won twice within four weeks
677665 winning is strange sometimes it doesnt go your way sometimes somebody else plays a bit better
677666 i could be easily us open champion but i didnt do the job when i needed to all you can do is give yourself chances and ive given myself a lot of chances
677667 i think consistency is what all professionals want thats what its about really
677668 obviously the more consistency the higher you get up in the world rankings if you show the consistency the wins will just come the more often you get yourself into the fray and feel the pressure of the last group and needing to make putts at certain times the more comfortable you get and then the wins come from there
677669 if i hadnt won in the states id feel there was something missing in my career
677670 im proud that ive won on every tour basically european asian and southern african
677671 these are a rung down from the major championships obviously but i havent won a world golf championships so thats obviously missing on my cv so it would mean a lot and obviously give me a massive amount of confidence going into next week too
677672 i suffer agony in anticipation of meeting people for fear they wont like me
677673 if this darned machine doesnt move any faster im going to kill something
677674 but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google
677675 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
677676 in any event plaintiffs live far from the desert and are far from hermits
677677 when plaintiffs discovered these images rather than using the simple removal option google affords they sued google for invasion of privacy trespass negligence and conversion
677678 the response quotes and expands upon an existing legal opinion to help frame the response
677679 it should not be interpreted as a blanket statement on our views towards privacy
677680 google respects an individuals right to privacy we have privacy protections built into all of our products

677690 if you consider chelsea it works in a very similar fashion to ferrari
677691 we are trying to take our abu dhabi based brand to the world and that means more than just placing a logo on a team

677751 the thing that is missing in most other places is princetons ability to deal with the complexity of the global health issue from the point of view of policy economics sociology ecology and psychology
677752 where else in the world can you find all of this in one institution
677753 on the one hand there is as significant a scientific existence here in molecular biology genomics chemistry and neuroscience as at the best medical schools in the country
677754 on the other hand the thing that is missing in most other places is princetons ability to deal with the complexity of the global health issue from the point of view of policy economics sociology ecology and psychology where else in the world can you find all of this in one institution
677755 the development and use of the rotavirus vaccine in our country and europe is a tremendous scientific achievement
677756 but the global impact of this vaccine will be far more tremendous we have to see that it is introduced and implemented globally
677757 its one order of magnitude to think about vaccination programs for infants and children the world has experience with that
677758 but its an even more complex thing to think about how to introduce a vaccination program in the developing world for adolescents and adults
677759 because of advances in technology in many parts of the world today the capabilities exist to develop and use infectious diseases for harm
677760 what is important is to develop boundaries and to develop concepts about responsibility and how to deal with these organisms and technologies the united states standing alone isnt going to be enough here it really has to be a global effort
677761 u s medical research and researchers pre eminence problems policies
677762 adel has a unique career history that allows him to provide an amazing range of perspectives from detailed biology to epidemiology and then to policy issues
677763 adels enthusiastic and thoroughly engaging personality supported by a wonderful sense of humor facilitates student involvement in all aspects of our course
677764 when anyone has a question in class professor mahmoud is able to fill it in with his personal experiences
677765 his class is structured in a way in which people are encouraged to ask about anything relating to infectious diseases and its a great learning experience whether a student is more interested in the biology behind a vaccine or the public policy effects
677766 he brings remarkable assets to this task distinguished personal science in the area of infectious disease major administrative leadership in academia and industry longstanding advocacy of a greater national commitment to improve global health and a special brand of warmth and empathy so important to undergraduate education at princeton
677767 even though my research is not directly involved with his primary field of research professor mahmoud still exhibits a passion for learning the material and his dedication and commitment to advising my project serve as a constant source of motivation for me
677768 it seems like he always has the answer and always gives the crucial piece of advice that makes some aspect of the study really take off from the personal side he has a great sense of humor and really makes you feel comfortable in his office
677769 the most important thing ive learned from dyane is to dance my heart out
677770 the students physically learn the history of african dance and the way it has changed since we came to america
677771 this is a place where i hope they feel safe and open they can really let it all hang out
677772 they practiced a more public form of healing vodoun in congo square
677773 something like these dances may have happened before a ritual or a greeting a get down and party moment
677774 dyane challenges her students to connect their ideas to their bodies
677775 they go from the known dance tradition to improvisation and after that she gives them a chance to create their own dances
677776 and dyane incorporates the history of the moves as she demonstrates them
677777 i get them to let go of their intellect and move
677778 african dance in particular seems to thrive on the dancers energy and dyane showed us that as long as we are passionately engaged the audience will enjoy the show no matter what
677779 this confidence is really empowering and i think i could have learned it only through taking dyanes class
677780 the first year in which the visual arts program has been a part of the lewis center for the arts has been exceptionally productive
677781 we had a record number of 14 thesis shows and new work in video painting sculpture photography printmaking ceramics and installation art
677782 installation art often tells a story or implies some form of a narrative
677783 imagine that your potential viewer is someone who doesnt speak your language and you can communicate only through presenting an unusual combination of things available to you
677784 a fleeting gesture of indulgence absurdly sweet and decadent is performed in a small room in hopes that the satiating sensation induced might stick
677785 the work tended to be big addressing design function and kitsch which is an important part of the ceramics spectrum
677786 it attempts to engage students visual participation with the world through painterly strategies that flourished in 19th century french painting temporally framed by corot and matisse value color and shape as keys to the expression of light the intent is to provide students with a historically alert way to think about picture making but as a manner of orientation not limit
677787 yo yo yo im from the 510 gold mountain might have been a mirage for my ancestors but i am making it real every day
677788 is a personal statement as it has a special significance to the person creating the work
677789 when i was younger i had a very strong tendency to idealize the past greece and rome were great stories and i took myths as great examples these were cultures and civilizations that i really admired and respected
677790 that feeling evolved into more of a respect for the study of classics itself as an interdisciplinary academic field in which you look at politics history literature and philosophy all together
677791 for undergraduates this isnt just a place where you come and get an education you live here for four years youre involved in campus life you make friends and meet people
677792 the friends ive made here are ones ill value for a very long time and im sure ill be friends with them for years and decades to come thats been a huge asset to my time at princeton the quality of the people here and how fun and interesting they are
677793 what made zachary stand out for me early on was a remarkable independence and even handedness in the face of sharing a situation everybody was in that of being new to princeton which never amounted to playing it cool
677794 rather it seemed to betray a genuine level headed fascination with and observation of the world around him asking himself some serious questions but always willing also to see the slightly more absurd side of the situation it is after all a strange time and place to be arriving in ones first year
677795 what became clear over the next years is that zach is someone who wears his learning lightly and gracefully
677796 he simply and genuinely finds it easy normal and pleasurable to think and he has an admirable talent to articulate that thinking with ease and with precision and to make it look easy yet the ease in that case is never one of complacency
677797 ive never seen a freshman come to college with the grasp of latin that he had
677798 it wasnt just that he knew his grammar syntax and vocabulary he really had an amazingly wide range of reference and plainly had just read a lot which would do credit to a student graduating from college much less beginning as a freshman
677799 in the seneca course he showed that he was thinking deeply about the texts we were reading
677800 he could anticipate the direction in which the discussion would be going in any given topic and get there a couple of steps more quickly
677801 how many students do you meet who can explain to you in brief but in depth ciceros political philosophy british economic policy the relative value of italian opera and the workings of quantum cascade lasers
677802 the social atmosphere and generally the quality of the people who were here
677803 the finest piece of research of this type that i have had occasion to read during my time at princeton
677804 had the perspicacity to see a very good subject and a talent that was equal to the task since an enormous amount of scholarship already exists on cicero even on these particular aspects of his thinking a fairly high bar was set to do any innovative research with the problem of private property and the nature of the state he both sighted the subject and was able to do so well with it i like to think not just because of his native abilities which are considerable but also because of the superlative training that he received in the classics here at princeton
677805 i was able to get a very good sense of the physical context in which all the history and literature that ive read took place which i think was very important for filling out the picture of how the ancient world really worked
677806 it trained you to step outside whatever assumptions or value systems that youre in and to realize there are different ways to organize a variety of human experiences in some sort of culture
677807 in case of the continuation of a downward trend in oil price one of the serious discussions in the next opec meeting will be definitely the quotas
677808 opec as the responsible body to control the market should be more meticulous for the control of quotas
677809 the member countries that have increased their capacity should control it the issue is that some countries have been supplying more than their quota
677810 i think the opening partnerships in both the innings was a turning point of the match sehwag getting a double hundred and giving fantastic starts with gautam gambhir was very important
677811 he sehwag is a very good player and the way he scored runs in both the innings was great getting 201 in a total of 329 is something amazing
677812 it was also amazing the way harbhajan singh bowled in both the innings and then ishant and zaheer khan today
677813 it was something special from the 19 year old sharma everybody saw what he is capable of it augurs really well going into the last test
677814 i was never worried you cannot say 300 350 is enough but on this wicket if you have 300 and the way our new ball bowlers bowled was amazing
677815 getting three wickets for 10 runs within 40 minutes was crucial and that put sri lanka on the backfoot
677816 i am really proud of the way we played in this test we are confident of putting up a good show and if we repeat this performance we will get a good result
677817 as the series goes on you try and figure out the best possible ways to handle the spinners they are quality spinners mendis is a mystery to some of us but sehwag has shown that you can get runs against the spinners
677818 it was important to get a good start when you are chasing any total which we did not get losing three wickets for 10 runs was not ideal and thats where we probably lost the game
677819 we had a plan but when you lose three quick wickets it is very difficult to fight back our batting was not consistent enough i thought we could give them a better fight
677820 i am very happy for ajantha he bowled brilliantly and supported the other bowlers as well but it is very disappointing to lose the game in which he has taken 10 wickets
677821 the kind of car that all countries and car companies love now is the green car consumers will also be happy when they drive such a car knowing it saves fuel and does not pollute
677822 such an effort by proton will also assist the government in saving petrol and preserving the environment
677823 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
677824 clearly they want to unite the job and get one bloke in there and theyve given paul a gentle nudge to say that this is in the best interests of the team
677825 hes been a wonderfully successful captain englands most successful in terms of test match wins and is surely one of englands greatest ever captains
677826 in terms of playing captaining leading decision making michael vaughan is the best man for the job
677827 this game was important for anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
677828 today sunday was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
677829 that is where i asked him to play and where i need him not right and left as before because we have one striker and that is anelka
677830 maybe i will receive good news about drogba and we have 12 days to train and maybe we will have something i dont expect
677831 we need to be careful in the way we make our argument that we dont do things that inadvertently stop there being a good platform for labours case to come across
677832 the labour party is clearly split right down the middle with some people backing brown and others trying to knife him
677833 what we have is a government in chaos at a time when britain faces serious challenges we simply cant go on like this for another 18 months we need a general election sooner rather than later
677834 seems longer though gavin joined the army just after we got married they transferred him to fort hannah when things started heating up with the indians
677835 my daddy was in the army i think i saw him two weeks out of every year usually at christmas time my momma said that sometimes she felt like a widow
677836 you must really be looking forward to seeing him tomorrow
677837 you dont look too excited about it whats the matter

677840 ihr erster podiumsplatz in der formel 1 was ist das f r ein gef hl
677841 es ist einfach unglaublich zur halbzeit meiner ersten saison auf dem podium zu stehen es war f r mich ein perfektes wochenende
677842 als ich massa ausrollen sah und wusste dass ich zweiter bin konnte ich es kaum glauben am ende kam dann noch r ikk nen n her aber ich wusste dass es sehr schwierig ist hier zu berholen ich musste dann einfach sehen keine fehler mehr zu machen
677843 h tten sie nach ihrem guten qualifying mit rang f nf gedacht dass das rennen f r sie noch so viel besser laufen k nnte
677844 ich h tte nie gedacht dass ich von platz f nf aufs podium fahren k nnte aber ich hatte einen guten speed bis in die endphase des rennens als ich mit meinem letzten reifensatz dann unter druck von kimi geraten bin ich hatte schon in hockenheim ein gutes auto in der rennabstimmung das ich an meinen stil angepasst hatte das konnte ich hier im qualifying und im rennen best tigen
677845 hatten sie keine nachwirkungen mehr von ihrem unfall vor zwei wochen in hockenheim
677846 nein das ist in den medien deutlich dramatischer gemacht worden als es war ich hatte mich schon am abend nach dem rennen wieder gut gef hlt aber man wollte mich zur sicherheit noch ber nacht im krankenhaus behalten
677847 yesterday evening abu mazen abbas and palestinian prime minister salam fayyad made a request for israel to allow them to cross into israel and then to hospitals and the west bank
677848 shortly afterwards barak was contacted again by abbas who asked him to allow all of them to return to gaza
677849 those battles were meant to erase our presence in the gaza strip this is political cleansing
677850 when you have palestinians being forced to flee their own territory by other palestinians it is a tragedy
677851 hamas might win the battle but this behaviour makes it so much harder to win international support to create an independent state this is the behaviour of a brutal dictatorship not a political party working towards advancing the interests of its people
677852 it is beyond doubt that there are now two separate palestinian territories so who does israel deal with
677853 mahmoud abbas does not speak for palestinians in gaza and hamas is not interested in any negotiations with israel at all this civil war makes a permanent solution impossible to negotiate

677878 ich habe alles gegeben aber mehr als dranbleiben an bauer und teuchert war heute nicht drin
677879 ich konnte das tempo der beiden an der spitze heute nicht mitgehen sondern nur rang drei gegen werner verteidigen jetzt stehen noch vier rennen und 100 punkte aus es gibt kein pardon mehr ich will unbedingt noch einen sieg
677880 wir haben gedacht dass wir das motorrad ber den mittag verbessert haben aber das ging wohl nach hinten los da ich nicht so schnell aus den kurven herausbeschleunigen konnte wie im ersten lauf

677882 ich musste die bremsbalance nach vorne verschieben danach hatte ich aber probleme mit blockierenden vorderr dern ausgehend davon war meine pace im ersten stint ganz gut

677993 there was no attempt to deal with the other key issues of workers rights pensions and the plight of agency workers a cynic would argue these talks were a stalling tactic from the outset and this social partnership is clearly now one of inequality

678021 witness merely changed his account from not sure to sure
678022 argued that moving from a not sure answer to one in which he was sure did not amount to a contradiction
678023 the prosecution subsequently applied to impeach yusri the witness following four contradictory pieces of evidence between the police statement and his evidence in court

678136 the whole hamlet is in uproar about it it is a council road and we have always had deliveries by the mail van
678137 i know it is steep and i know it is narrow but there are lots of little roads like that you just have to drive carefully
678138 i drive up and down the road in a normal car and have had no problems there have been no accidents on that hill i know because i have lived here most of my life
678139 if i cant rely on the postal service i dont see how i can continue to work
678140 this is a real blow to the rural economy which is already suffering what business is going to come and set up here if they cant even be sure theyll get their post
678141 a health and safety risk assessment has confirmed that the level of risk associated with this delivery is unacceptable due to an unsuitable track
678142 the condition of the track could contribute to longer term back injury with out employee
678143 under the circumstances mail deliveries to your address will be suspended from tomorrow and your address will be classed as one which does not receive the normal daily delivery to the door for health and safety reasons
678144 it is a council maintained road there are four passing places it is perfectly safe and we even grit it in the winter
678145 i am very concerned now how many other similarly small villages could be hit by a post ban with no warning this sort of ban could rip the heart out of communities such as booze

678160 theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something graham said in an appearance on
678161 to talk about your name the way you look and john mccain doesnt want to get elected on that so the idea hes not interjecting race quite frankly is not credible
678162 has never said that he believes that john mccain is a racist daschle said in his appearance on
678163 hes never said anything that that he was using race in this effort you cant quote him you cant find him saying that and where the mccain campaign couldnt get any traction on the issues they go after him personally they go after him as a person who really doesnt fit the political mold
678164 now without john doing one thing theyre suggesting that obama is a victim of john mccain to say that thats not trying to interject the idea that youre a victim of john mccain trying to make fun of your name and your racial background is a lie
678165 why wont you go to a town hall stand in front of normal people and answer their questions the whole thing is very disturbing why wont you allow the american people to look under the hood and test your tires on your ideas but you say your opponent has no ideas
678166 sen obama did something no one has ever done that i know of go overseas and have a rally in front of 200 000 adoring fans and talk like youre the embodiment of america that he is in fact living off celebrity not ideas and one of the campaign issues is credibility
678167 all i can tell you is that thank god that senator obama wasnt making policy on iraq he doesnt understand to this day tom that if you lose in iraq its a big loss in the greater war if youd lost in iraq the biggest winner would have been iran the topic were talking about
678168 but heres what john mccain understands dont elevate the tyrant he would never sit down with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad without preconditions because that is the worst thing you could do barack obamas judgment on iran has been terrible he would empower the very forces were trying to control by elevating them in the worlds eye so theres a huge difference here
678169 well obama has been consistent from the very beginning on this
678170 we have offered counter offered john had suggested some ideas for town hall meetings
678171 at this point at this point were really down to convention time and weve got two months so you cant there really isnt a lot of time for additional debates now

678422 if only there were some service that would reliably predict when any period of non voluntary solitude would end it would cut out the anxiety and allow single people to enjoy the good things about their lives increased lucidity productivity creativity and self awareness
678423 i think you will agree with me that selling ones self just to make money is wrong the more that its wrong if an establishment sells a person to make money
678424 in cases of business establishments the sole proprietor partners manager cashier shall be held liable if its a corporation the board of directors shall also be held criminally liable

678429 you go in and take a hot shower and retire to bed and you start what i call zoning down coming back to real life
678430 then you start talking to yourself you did it this was your dream when you were at mcclymonds
678431 its the best feeling in the world when youre the fastest man in the world its like walking around on clouds
678432 my ex wife doesnt know this nobody knows it but i stood there for 10 or 15 minutes crying i had to let it out
678433 they told my wife dont sleep in the bed with your husband they gave instructions to a married woman on how not to sleep with her husband
678434 i slept in the bed and we did what husbands and wives do
678435 i felt fine the next morning because i got such a good rest the other guys were tossing and turning i was in a comfortable place that i was accustomed to very relaxed and i just went out there and ran
678436 i dont even think i did the big picture until 10 years later
678437 im ready for bed im laying down but i was back in that first pitch
678438 it was the first time i sort of enjoyed it at all i remember the feeling and everything clicked
678439 everything you worked for the last 20 years sort of came out in that first pitch i dont know if they clocked that but i know it was freaking fast and it was going to go right down the middle
678440 its just weird its a team sport but when youre in that pitchers circle sometimes you feel really alone
678441 cmon you and me now they televise everything its a good thing they didnt do it then because you would have seen me talking the whole time
678442 i understand why he did it she said of u
678443 but even after the game i was still thinking about how that next pitch would have been better than the last one i threw
678444 i suppose that doesnt let you enjoy it as a whole but the older i get i look back on it more fondly than i did right after the game
678445 i was one of the few to make it through the boycott you have to answer so many questions am i going to win my times made me a favorite but until you step on the blocks you just dont know
678446 the 200 butterfly was a tough race to have hanging over my head because it was so much of a chore for me it was back to business
678447 when youre in the middle of it you almost cant know how special it is
678448 twenty four years later i can definitely step back its different now you definitely realize how special it is and how lucky you are
678449 we were in l a and we had a big party at the hotel afterward
678450 you can imagine as a college junior there were not really any boundaries
678451 sean was 2 months old and we put the gold medal around his neck and took pictures of him
678452 but they were both dreams to be able to share with family and friends there was satisfaction and relief too you feel some pressure representing more than yourself youre playing for the united states
678453 i probably could have gotten home from barcelona without the plane
678454 i remember reminiscing on the flight with assistant coach p j carlesimo how we were going to go down in history
678455 one thing that was for sure you can only do something for the first time once
678456 that medal is a symbol of a lot of things
678457 ill always remember 1996 as the olympics that women took over we showed the world that women are strong competitive and beautiful that was the beginning we went down in history that group was amazing
678458 i just remember thinking what this is crazy at one point i looked up and thought i could see stars twinkling in the sky but it was the lights from all of the cameras
678459 there was this sense of freedom release and joy we were so elated
678460 there was a greater purpose to show the world a level of womens basketball theyd never seen the olympics was a launchpad for womens basketball in the united states we showed people what we already knew for years
678461 whenever you can do something that has a lasting impact
678462 to me an athlete who has an individual sport and theyre on the stand by themselves i can see its a lot more emotional than it is for a team
678463 its very exciting but with an individual you see the tears coming down their face i dont remember anything special we did it doesnt stand out like other things like winning the ncaa title at cal
678464 it was kind of a blur at some point all the guys got to me
678465 the focus was really on me because of what had happened to me they obviously wanted it for themselves but they wanted it for me that was a good feeling i wanted them to know in every way that i appreciated that because i really did i was very happy that they felt that way about me
678466 obviously that wasnt my prime objective not having that 100 detracted a bit but only in the sense that i didnt get to run it
678467 you go in and take a hot shower and retire to bed and you start what i call zoning down coming back to real life
678468 then you start talking to yourself you did it this was your dream when you were at mcclymonds

678506 my team right or wrong totally blinkered entrenchment i just cant see anything changing for the foreseeable future
678507 if theres one word that sums up the churchs attitude to sex it would be wow
678508 it already has to some extent i go to a church where i can practise the sort of catholicism i believe was intended by vatican ii
678509 it welcomes gays and many of us would see a case for abortion for instance if it involved a young girl who had been raped i see no problem in that
678510 catholicism has always been a moveable feast things come and go and nobody minds were used to change years ago mary sometimes seemed more adored than jesus but these days you hardly hear of her possibly the women priest issue had something to do with that
678511 we raised our kids catholic but they went their own way they dont go to church but do think themselves catholic
678512 gen ys from conservative protestant denominations manifest much higher levels of religious belief and practise than catholics or anglicans
678513 at one meeting some 2000 of them stepped forward after he had pitched them a line of rock n rollery
678514 in america teenagers have a language all their own and think that grown ups are all squares because they cant dig the jive
678515 what happens to those young catholics when they go back to their churches will anything have changed

678519 he jumped out of the helicopter to go and get more guys when he got attacked and shot he was transported to the hospital but was dead on arrival
678520 all those who had the pleasure of knowing him appreciated his great sense of humor and honesty his contribution to alpha company can be seen in the heart and soul of every member he will be truly missed
678521 his actions on nov 1 2006 that helped save the lives of two fellow soldiers following an enemy attack
678522 courageous actions on nov 7 2006 where he made the ultimate sacrifice while providing covering fire for his soldiers
678523 he has been away for a long time and for the last time we would like us to be together in our home

678529 what will likely happen is that well be pursuing some projects ahead of others we have to break it up and pursue the projects that will give the highest yields ahead of the others
678530 what we want from our investments is for our business to grow and for our shareholders to benefit if additional capital is needed to do that then well invest more capital
678531 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
678532 its a job ive loved i put my heart and soul into it but its also the easiest because my mind just told me to pack it in i just felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this will prolong my career
678533 and last but not least i want to thank my family
678534 my mum and dad have been also i spoke to my dad this morning and he said you can walk away a proud lad because youve given it everything and thats all he asked me to do so i really want to thank them

678544 when text is copied from a previous email and should be
678545 first of all all you guys should check out this website articles very valuable insights im taken by this site
678546 u ntil 2 days ago i thought i was a crazy abnormal taken in hand website i have never felt such relief such internal peace in my life this whole idea of being loved and trusting enough in another to place my his and our well being into his hands was exactly what i have been searching for my whole life i spent 16 hours just reading it is like a huge weight has lifted off my shoulders
678547 there are lots of websites for people in the bdsm d s dd domestic discipline and spanking communities there are websites for people who belong to religions that advocate male head of household marriage there are even websites for christians who are interested in bdsm but there are very few websites for people who are interested in male led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above communities associate with this kind of relationship jargon clothes etc some of us dont even like thinking of this as a lifestyle if you are interested in this kind of relationship but are not interested in bdsm or d s or dd or spanking websites theres a new website for you taken in hand is really the most beautiful website devoted to dd
678548 t he whole damn site really is one of the most well articulated pro con loaded blogs ive seen it provides a cross section of how people are feeling out there even amongst those who are seemingly natural allies
678549 as i view it im a control freak i love to be in control however i fantasize about that control being stripped from me and handed over to someone else namely my husband im just glad i found a site that makes me realize im not a freak for wanting to be dominated
678550 thank you for providing such a positive validating place for like minded people to talk about this in a way that affirms the dignity of both men and women

678553 the forest service would be on its knees except for the money congress provides
678554 this thing is pretty close to being out of control
678555 the forest service bases its budget for forest fires on wishful thinking its a constant juggling act and thats not the way it should be done

678559 tab for wordpress 2 5 the settings is quite straight forward take a look at the sanpshot which is quite self explained below
678560 our data indicate an abrupt increase in storminess during the autumn to spring seasons occurring from one year to the next at 12 679 years before the present broadly coincident with other changes in this region
678561 we suggest that this shift in wind strength represents an abrupt change in the north atlantic westerlies towards a stronger and more zonal jet
678562 im looking at 10 days ahead and i dont see any big break
678563 to be this critical and have the fire conditions we have now is unusual for this time of year
678564 there is no indicator that we are going to have it yet but we are concerned with the increasing number of hotspots
678565 we are doing our best to avoid any open burning here in the country
678566 it had been there for many years and probably would be there for many more
678567 now i guess there might be more people making a pilgrimage to these glaciers before they go
678568 ice is almost like a species that is going extinct
678569 its the far north and the higher elevations that are seeing the impacts first
678570 and when it comes to california it doesnt get any higher than the sierra
678571 when i started doing climate change research in the sierra nevada around 1990 it seemed like an abstraction
678572 over the last five years the canary in the coal mine died
678573 its almost a shock to find out how many things are changing and how rapidly they are changing
678574 its doing this not in tens of thousands of years but in decades
678575 we are going into new territory that has not been seen in a long long time
678576 despite their imposing grandeur and apparent fortitude mountains contain highly sensitive environments that support delicately balanced physical and natural systems a warming of only a few degrees has major implications
678577 its like throwing a switch you get water or you get ice
678578 this winter there were a number of storms in yosemite valley where it was just kind of spitting snow but it never really got cold enough to snow
678579 a few degrees makes a fair amount of difference when sap starts rising plants begin to grow and insects become active
678580 it could very well be that giant sequoias become relics that survive for centuries where they are as they gradually die off and are not replaced
678581 there is going to be a great deal of nail biting there are going to be constant surprises for everyone
678582 resorts would be forced to rely entirely on snowmaking or move their operations
678583 when i was a kid i used to spend close to nine months a year in my ski boots
678584 you can only go up so far before you run out of mountain
678585 its just a single pine thats the insidious part sometimes you dont notice it because its a tree here and a tree there but there used to be a lot more there and today there are very few
678586 the less snow you have the more severe the fire becomes
678587 if the snow melts earlier the fuels are available for a longer period of time
678588 what a great experience what a jumble of fascination great ice pool
678589 there used to be a massive tongue of ice here
678590 the key thing is all the ice loss is occurring about the same time all these caves are being influenced by a common factor which is more than likely global climate change
678591 on the whole sierra nevada glaciers have retreated roughly 50 percent from a century ago
678592 if those rates continue we will probably be without glaciers in something like 50 years
678593 floats as a pale ship on a sea of desolate granite
678594 the east lobe is almost invisible you see a thin flake of ice like the stuff in a refrigerator that doesnt defrost
678595 the west lobe is more healthy but it has shriveled and shrunken the way a pumpkin does four weeks after halloween
678596 it wont be long until the lyell glacier is no more two or three more decades maybe
678597 i set out to trace the ancient ice current back to its farthest recesses
678598 a small but well characterized glacier swooping down from the somber precipices of black mountain
678599 while i am frustrated that the legislature hasnt reached an agreement i am very encouraged that all four legislative leaders recognize the need to reform our broken budget system and as i have said before i will not sign a budget without substantive and long term budget reform the people elected me to bring sanity and stability to our states finances
678600 weve been encouraging local police forces to make more officers available to schools no school staff should be obliged to conduct searches where there is doubt police should be called in to do the searches

678611 i would think john would never make it a litmus test but when it comes down to a nominee selecting a vice presidential running mate its their decision exclusively
678612 and i would respect that decision one way or another
678613 i think at the end of the day i think the party would be comfortable with someone senator mccain was comfortable with and that is ultimately his decision
678614 i would have that conversation with my friend john and report back to you
678615 the commercial elevates the whole question of energy policy in a way that some people like some people dont like

678624 i got outside and the cops shut the club down no one inside could leave and no one outside in the parking lot could leave either one of my friends was stuck inside the club and people were scared that the shooter was still inside
678625 im sad this incident happened because it interrupted a beautiful and loving party im happy none of my people or friends got hurt and the party continues
678626 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
678627 this puts a key part of the dashboard in place
678628 this is the most reliable estimate weve had since the beginning of the epidemic
678629 the largest commitment by any nation to combat a single disease in human history
678630 evidence of a failure by government and society to do what it takes to control the epidemic
678631 we have been inadequately funding this epidemic all along we need to step it up
678632 having winners earlier in the week just settled the jitters and it was nice to get on the board early you can just concentrate on riding your horses then
678633 weve had one or two little blips along the way but you will always have that
678634 its not easy to win races here the races are very competitive especially some of the maidens these are horses that we are going to be looking forward to the future with its very competitive
678635 thats only my second winner and it was my first ride at galway
678636 i was lucky to get the ride in the race and i got the breaks when i needed them you need a horse that travels and you need to quicken up the hill if you can
678637 at the start of this season i had a very bad fall on my first ride at dundalk but the boss prendergast has been very good to me
678638 im looking to ride as many winners as i can and ride out my claim as quickly as possible
678639 this horse has plenty of class but hes a bit of an enigma
678640 he jumped well so well stay chasing for now ill look for a novice chase next possibly at tralee so his owner can see him
678641 he ran a cracker here on tuesday when the ground was a bit tacky for him he much preferred the faster ground today
678642 the plan was not to hit the front too soon but paddy said he had no choice but to go on when he did
678643 hell make a lovely chaser but i think well wait until next year before sending him over fences
678644 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me

678649 at any one time there are more than 150 computers and servers in use on the network so the potential for infection is pretty high when i came on board the school was using symantecs norton antivirus to keep the network clean while the software has a good reputation for ease of use my experience with the product was not too good at keeping viruses out

678656 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
678657 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
678658 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
678659 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
678660 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
678661 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
678662 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
678663 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
678664 mr benson was not involved at all in any wrongful activity in fact he was a proponent of uncovering it and bringing it to the attention of the u s attorneys office

678667 why is it that every story written by david knowles doesnt seem to be true
678668 you dont have to wrangle somebody into a comedy club you can literally watch it wherever you are and thats it
678669 people are becoming instant celebrities literally overnight because of it because on the internet once somebody knows about it the whole world can know about it in 10 minutes
678670 when i started covering comedy it was very straightforward you did standup or sketch and it was live and that was that
678671 the idea now is to create something online that gains value from being well known and subscribed to and then sell it or make it into a tv show
678672 absolutely nothing changed when we went over to the comedy network
678673 we kept our own studio we filmed what we wanted we didnt have to compromise anything that was the whole point of it
678674 i think thats going to happen more you cannot ask somebody to change what has already been a success which is what the internet has allowed people to do
678675 lets say we did 10 live shows and just for fun 2 000 people came to see us
678676 we put out a video and in some cases its already up to 25 000 people and its not just toronto its everywhere
678677 sometimes some websites wont pick videos up because what will beat it out is somebody getting kicked in the nuts or two old men fighting on a driveway
678678 theres about a three month period there that was very blurry to me where i had periods of being quite coherent and doing things and then i would lose it and take off on a bender for many days at a time
678679 i became very negative and i really didnt care about anything towards the end i just was this self absorbed negative individual
678680 look at the international superstar drunk as a skunk trying to smoke a cigar he just dumped his wife and the bank took his car hes an international superstar
678681 i really got out of the mode of trusting my instincts and i think a lot of that was because i was pretty messed up
678682 it got to the point where i dont think i was dealing correctly with reality and not judging not able to focus in on my instincts when it came to writing everything gets affected by that and sometimes in a positive way and unfortunately most of the time in a negative way
678683 our tour rider was huge a huge huge rider of alcohol
678684 were talking like two large bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka and a bottle of schnapps and a bottle of scotch and 48 beer and anything else that you may want in there and you know if youre really smart about it then you can do things in moderation and have no problem with it but im not like that
678685 im the luckiest guy in the world right now because theres a good chance that i would not be here and not able to do what im doing
678686 das vgh urteil vom 16 juli 2008 stellt unmissverst ndlich klar die beobachtung und berwachung von versammlungen in geschlossenen r umen durch polizisten ist verfassungswidrig und ein generelles anwesenheitsrecht der polizei bei ffentlichen veranstaltungen wie es jahrelang immer wieder gegen den willen vieler veranstalter praktiziert wurde und wie es auch im neuen bayerischen versammlungsgesetz vorgesehen wird ist ebenfalls eindeutig rechtswidrig es stellt einen schweren eingriff in die grundrechte aller b rger dar und ist somit ein fundamentaler angriff auf die vom grundgesetz garantierte meinungs und versammlungsfreiheit das urteil st rkt damit die kritik am obrigkeitsstaalichen geist des neuen bayerischen versammlungsgesetzes der csu staatsregierung die rechtsauffassung des polizeipr sidiums m nchen das f r sich stets ein generalpr ventives anwesenheitsrecht in anspruch genommen hat atmet obrigkeitsstaatlichen geist und war ein weiterer schritt in den berwachungsstaat jetzt steht fest die praxis der m nchner polizei war seit jahren eindeutig verfassungswidrig in zukunft muss sich niemand mehr die berwachung seiner veranstaltungen durch die anwesenheit von polizisten gefallen lassen mit diesem urteil ist das grundgesetzlich garantierte recht auf meinungs und versammlungsfreiheit gest rkt worden es darf in zukunft nicht durch eine polizeipr ventive und grundgesetzwidrige berwachungspraxis weiter ausgeh hlt und eingeschr nkt werden genauso wie das argument der polizei vorgeschoben war eine veranstaltung gegen den erkl rten willen der veranstalter und der teilnehmer durch beobachtung und berwachung sch tzen zu wollen ist d e behauptung der staatsregierung vorgeschoben das neue versammlungsgesetz diene dem kampf gegen rechtsextremismus im gegenteil wird das neue gesetz wie viele ehemalige kz h ftlinge und initiativen gegen neonazismus festgestellt haben den protest und widerstand gegen rechtsradikalismus und die demokratische verhinderung von naziaufm rschen auf der stra e sogar erschweren genauso wie wir f r das uneingeschr nkte versammlungsrecht in geschlossen r umen gestritten haben werden wir auch das gestern von der csu landtagsmehrheit beschlossene neue versammlungsgesetz zu fall bringen es ist eindeutig rechts und verfassungswidrig und ausdruck einer autorit ren und obrigkeitsstaatlichen haltung sowie ein weiterer schritt in den berwachungsstaat

678719 a little bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing
678720 u2 always felt it would be pathetic to be good at the music and bad at the business
678721 i think its part of the artists responsibility quite honestly and artists who arent interested in that are going to find it harder to reach an audience
678722 artists and managers who have their wits about them are now doing things for themselves that were historically done by record companies
678723 the business model that i expect to see develop in the future will be in partnership with the isps where they effectively become revenue collection partners for rights owners its a pity that they have preferred to sell broadband subscriptions as fast as they possibly can without observing their responsibilities to the content owners but there are encouraging signs that they are waking up
678724 some music will be heard on services where the revenue comes from advertisers it wouldnt suit the clients that i manage but the future will be multi platform and artists will have to embrace that if they want to be successful
678725 i dont have nostalgia for the way things were more music is being made and listened to than ever before and the multiple platforms provided by streaming services digital downloads and physical products should make it a more interesting world it is certainly more complex but the opportunities are greater than ever
678726 we were pretty suspicious of greatest hits which were usually premature and had no artist input and often signalled the end of a bands career we felt it was the bands responsibility to compile and order its own catalogue and these albums should be as much a part of their canon of work as a regular album
678727 we have treated it as an opportunity not a chore
678728 i do not expect the cd to disappear in my lifetime but i think artists and record companies have to put more effort into it otherwise why would people want one over a download the artwork surrounding the release of a new music from an artist that youre interested in is in many ways just as interesting as the music i can remember when carrying a 12 inch lp down the street was almost an expression of the kind of person you were every bit as significant as what you wore or how you cut your hair these things evolve but i think the industry as a whole is missing the opportunity to produce the digital visual coefficient of an album sleeve and watch this space because its something u2 are addressing on their next album
678729 the only people who think music isnt free any more are the record companies
678730 it disturbs me greatly when i hear quite sensible people talking about the end of copyright i think copyright is part of civilisation and wed be very foolish indeed to accept the proposal that it is now a redundant concept
678731 at the moment our efforts are focused on rescue once that is complete we will investigate the cause
678732 there is no need to panic everything is normalized now

678735 consumers were happy to embrace standard dvd when that format arrived because the improvement in quality over vhs videotapes was dramatic standard dvd didnt require the purchase of a new tv either in contrast while half of the respondents to our survey rated quality as much better than standard dvd another 40 termed it only somewhat better and most are very satisfied with the performance of their current dvd players

678927 recent data releases and reports suggest that the consumer will continue to be pressured on all fronts income or cash flow wealth and credit consumers can spend using any of these buckets however with the labor market continuing to weaken housing continuing to deteriorate and credit harder to come by the outlook for spending remains bleak despite recent declines in gasoline prices
678928 the us may now be in a very long recession that will drive the unemployment rate higher with little that the federal reserve can do to help
678929 it is nearly certain the fed will leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the august 5 meeting the market expects a higher federal funds rate at the end of the year we do not the details of the gdp report point to significant weakness in the economy against this backdrop and financial market fragility the fed would only exacerbate the economic situation by raising the federal funds rate in haste fighting inflation will have to remain on the back burner until financial and economic conditions improve by that time inflation is likely to be moderating as it is a lagging economic process
678930 if it walks like a recession and talks like a recession it must be a recession is the fed going to raise its funds rate target over the remainder of 2008 not bloody likely
678931 former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said the us is nowhere near the bottom of the housing slump and is right on the brink of a recession
678932 in an exclusive interview on cnbc greenspan said the us economy is holding up rather well considering the extraordinary pressures from the financial sector but he added that a recession appears inevitable
678933 whitney says loosely transcribed fed knows there is no quick fix every time they open window they lose fire power for next crisis there is not much capital out there that wants to rescue brokers i keep saying we are less than 50 done with this crisis and are still there all capital raised by banks so far 450 billion was only to plug holes and not to grow business all banks assets marked at unrealistic levels creditors have cut mortgages and credit lines to the areas with the worst house prices depreciation that will hurt consumers even more corporate loan market will get hit soon as well maria was prodding to find out how quickly the stock prices were going back to the highs pump pump pump whitney says there is no way the bank stocks will return to the highs in next 3 years no comment on 5 years out the brokers are not growing capital and diluting the shareholder they cant grow earnings that way merrill raised tremendous amounts of capital just to plug holes they still have to shed assets and are not out of woods yet most every bank has to write down assets like merrill and raise capital banks who got in bed with housing assets such as c ubs mer bac wb will be in the market soon to do another capital raise everyone was involved in mortgages all of these banks are in trouble now 25 institutions will have to raise capital in next two months banks will cut dividends i dont understand why banks raise capital and then still pay a dividend it is not prudent for board members to keep paying when they are so capital restrained fannie freddie in same situation as every other institution all banks are betting on house price assumptions that are far too optimistic no banks are close to case shiller due to banks bad math losses will apply to everyone across the board in 2006 07 2 5 trillion was securitized nobody can replace this mortgage money and housing prices will continue to suffer as a result when maria asked if lehman will survive she said huh huh huh huh huh huh i dont know i am very opinionated on the short selling rule if you want to have faith in the capital market there has to be two sides to every trade and people have to be able to hedge restricting free trade will have the opposite effect and endanger the markets jamie dimon and goldman are pros and very cautious and aware of risks
678934 the us may now be in a very long recession that will drive the unemployment rate higher with little that the federal reserve can do to help said harvard university professor martin feldstein
678935 i dont see recovery on the horizon feldstein who headed the national bureau of economic research until june and serves on the groups recession dating panel said in an interview with bloomberg radio
678936 feldstein said the fed has already lowered interest rates as much as it can to help growth and that exports offer the only bright spot while they arent strong enough to fuel a recovery
678937 the next president should not be raising taxes feldstein said he said he was really surprised that obama hasnt backed off his proposals for a major tax increase
678938 feldstein said todays gross domestic product figures reinforced his view that the economy entered a recession in december or january gdp shrank at the end of 2007 and grew less than forecast in this years second quarter the commerce department reported today
678939 fed officials have lowered their benchmark rate to 2 from 5 25 since september bringing the reductions to a halt in june amid rising concern that inflation will accelerate feldstein indicated the central bank should refrain from lowering borrowing costs further

678941 real gdp grew at a slightly slower pace during the period of revision 2005 2007 the most noteworthy aspect was the contraction in real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 0 2 from an increase of 0 6 as per the previously published estimate
678942 in the second quarter consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 1
678943 exports of goods and services grew at an annual rate of 9

678948 after the november elections the national bureau of economic research will tell us what we and the fed already know the us economy currently is in a recession industrial commodity prices appear to have peaked which will begin to moderate the trend in headline us inflation in a couple of months businesses have little pricing power at the consumer level there is no evidence of a wage price spiral the inflation expectations anchor does not appear to be dragging the dollar appears to have stabilized in large part because of economic growth in the rest of the world appears to be slowing significantly losses continue to mount on the books of financial institutions which will inhibit credit creation is the fed going to raise its funds rate target over the remainder of 2008 not bloody likely

678951 the effects of the economic slump have worsened the job market and the white house forecast the jobless rate will average 5

678953 the consumer price index will rise 3 8 this year compared with a february forecast for 2 7 the white house said next year the cost of living will increase 2 3 faster than the 2 1 gain predicted five months ago

678955 the us treasury on monday said its borrowing would increase to 171 billion this quarter let us note three important points 1 budget deficits increase 50 to 100 in recessions 2 official budget deficit estimates historically greatly underestimate the deficits due to ridiculous assumptions and 3 surging nationalization and socialization is substantially increasing us guarantees and debt
678956 the credit squeeze in the us economy is likely to persist for many months and might even get worse gary stern president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis has told the financial times
678957 he said that with interest rates at 2 the fed was well placed to cope with any negative surprises on growth by contrast he said it was not as well positioned to deal with any negative surprises on inflation
678958 even without any such surprises the minneapolis fed chief also said real interest rates were at levels that if sustained for too long would not be compatible with medium term price stability
678959 an asset deflation in turn becomes a debt deflation pimco estimates a total of 5 trillion dollars of mortgage loans are in risky asset categories and that nearly 1 trillion dollars of cumulative losses will finally mark the gravestone of this housing bubble the problem with writing off 1 trillion dollars from the finance industrys cumulative balance sheet is that if not matched by capital raising it necessitates a sale of assets a reduction in lending or both that in turn begins to affect economic growth creating what mohamed el erian fears as a negative feedback loop
678960 president george w bush signed into law legislation that helps 400 000 homeowners facing foreclosure and extends a lifeline to fannie mae and freddie mac
678961 bush signed the measure at the white house shortly after 7 a m spokesman tony fratto said treasury secretary henry paulson housing and urban development secretary steve preston and federal housing administration director brian montgomery were among those present
678962 we look forward to putting in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac fratto said
678963 the law is aimed at stemming foreclosures and halting a free fall in housing prices by providing federal insurance for refinanced 30 year mortgages for homeowners struggling to make their monthly payments
678964 the measure also is designed to restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by tightening regulations and authorizing the treasury secretary to inject capital into the two biggest u s providers of mortgage money

678968 robert herz fasb chairman said that the move was made reluctantly after a staff recommendation for a delay because there might not be enough time for all companies to adjust to the up heaval

678980 bond yields have risen in recent months pushed up by increasing inflation concerns and comments from some members of the fomc federal open mouth committee financial institutions are also belatedly widening spreads and tightening lending standards
678981 moreover the stock of unsold houses remains far too high to stabilize house prices especially existing home inventories which hit a new high last month bottom line mortgage rates and inventories need to decline before housing stabilizes until then the economy and banking system will remain at risk
678982 the conference boards consumer confidence index moved up slightly to 51 9 in july from 51 0 in june the june reading of the index appears to be the cycle low for now the july report suggests that the outlook of consumers is stabilizing

678988 merrill lynch is to raise an extra 8 5 billion in fresh capital on top of 23 5 billion already raised in the past 12 months as the beleaguered investment bank took some drastic steps to right its capital position
678989 merrill which just two weeks ago announced plans to raise almost 8 billion from asset sales including its 20 stake in financial news provider bloomberg revealed that it needs to raise the money after disclosing that it will take a financial hit of 10 6 billion in the third quarter
678990 the news will come as a surprise to the financial community which had hoped that the worse was over for merrill which has already been one of the largest victims to date of the continuing credit crisis
678991 prior to this latest series of writedowns and exceptional losses merrill has already written down 40 billion in assets and other instruments
678992 but chairman and chief executive john thain said that the news was positive because of the fact it has been able to off load the substantial majority of its positions in a certain type of complex debt vehicle
678993 mr thain who took over from stan oneal last december said the news marked a significant milestone in our risk reduction efforts
678994 leading global banks including citigroup and ubs on tuesday faced renewed pressure to write down or sell billions of dollars in toxic assets following merrill lynchs disposal of 30 billion in mortgage related securities at a cut price
678995 merrills move to sell collateralised debt obligations cdos for 6 7 billion or 22 cents on the dollar announced on monday night raised hopes that other banks would be able to strike similar deals and purge their balance sheets of bad assets
678996 however the low price paid by lone star funds a distressed debt investor to buy merrills cdos sparked fears that the financial system could enter another spiral of huge writedowns followed by highly dilutive capital raisings
678997 merrill on tuesday raised 8 5 billion to offset 5 7 billion of writedowns caused by the cdo sales and other losses by selling shares at 22 50 a 7 5 discount to mondays close
678998 mike mayo deutsche bank analyst said merrills action a fortnight after john thain chief executive said that it did not need more capital raises ongoing credibility issues for the industry

679000 developed market bond yields should move markedly higher through the rest of this summer but then fall sharply going into 2009 says daniel pfaendler head of g10 economics amp strategy at dresdner kleinwort
679001 he believes the oil price shock and the unwinding of asset bubbles over leverage and economic imbalances in general should keep growth significantly below trend and real yields depressed for a protracted period of time
679002 price stability oriented central banks having learned their lessons from the 1970s should become more hawkish in the near term thereby limiting the upward pressure on long run inflation expectations mr pfaendler says
679003 however he believes inflation will peak around autumn and then fall significantly into 2009
679004 he adds that the positive growth effects of us tax rebates should dissipate raising the risk of a simultaneous recession in the us the eurozone and the uk during winter
679005 therefore real yields and inflation expectations should be able to fall in tandem making long duration as well as curve steepening exposure across developed bond markets attractive again
679006 do you remember treasury secretary paulson rushing all over the world beijing moscow berlin tokyo you name it

679009 faced with a swelling federal budget deficit as a slowing economy saps tax revenues the us treasury is expected to boost the frequency of 10 year note sales and offer more 30 year bonds next month
679010 analysts estimate the treasury will announce plans to sell 15 billion to 16 billion in 10 year notes and 9 billion to 10 billion in long bonds at its refunding announcement on wednesday
679011 theres a realization that these higher deficits are going to be with us for a while because the outlook for growth in the second half and into next year has deteriorated said lou crandall chief economist at wrightson icap in jersey city new jersey

679014 the presidency would like to place it on record that president thabo mbeki has never at any stage received any amount of money from man ferrostaal
679015 but a hotch potch recycling of allegations that have from time been peddled against the governments strategic defence procurement package
679016 this time the sunday times outdoes itself by placing a spurious allegation in the public domain ie president thabo mbeki received a bribe of 30 million rands from man ferrostaal

679019 the continuation of fighting between palestinian factions will harm the palestinian cause and endanger efforts aimed at setting up an independent palestinian state

679026 congratulations to heikki who drove a great race and he deserves his win
679027 i have had a great feeling since friday in the last lap i still couldnt believe i was going to be on the podium
679028 they dont want to give the impression that somehow they have lost their concern over inflation that would be fatal
679029 the risks of economic weakness and rising inflation remain relatively balanced
679030 the fed will maintain its accommodative stance for now while refinements to its enhanced liquidity facilities help ease financial strains
679031 they still see downside risks to the economy and the news from financial firms has not been good
679032 i think that they will sit right where they are
679033 i think the decline in oil prices has pulled some of the hawks fangs a bit and they wont be quite as eager as a group to raise interest rates now
679034 they didnt dissent last time why would they dissent now that oil is 20 a barrel cheaper
679035 the power to bargain for higher wages a power that we assume was dismantled may not be so feeble

679071 just before the last safety car it became a little bit slippery but it was race able as long as you could see where you were going
679072 the driving is okay as long as you can get the water off your windshield if you have a wiper youre alright
679073 when it started raining hard again i had some oil on the window and just couldnt get rid of it
679074 it was very drive able it was slippery but it was the same for everyone so it was good racing as long as we were running in the front it was fun
679075 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
679076 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim
679077 joey couldnt see when guys stopped in front of him he ran into the back of them he had no warnings that the guy was going to stop i have to be honest i had a lot of fun today this is pretty cool its the first points race in the rain but when drivers are saying enough is enough we need to heed that caution and we did not today
679078 its my kind of racing but you really need to be set up right and the tires as old as they are theyre a little hard so was zero grip out there
679079 all in all im surprised how well everyone did and how few accidents there were in the end people were wrecking under caution because you just couldnt see the cars were hydroplaning all in all it was a great day except we didnt win

679087 its only just begun its been fun we were fucked up and numb
679088 you recognize this shape its the back of your hand you placed it on my face here again and again
679089 when theyre coming from a band whove hit the big time on mtv while the same could be said of the self describing chorus of
679090 do you curse the happy couple do you cringe at wedding bells do you drink up all the punch while you wish em all to hell
679091 masturbation can be fun join the holy orgy kama sutra everyone
679092 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
679093 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
679094 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
679095 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
679096 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
679097 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
679098 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
679099 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
679100 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
679101 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
679102 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
679103 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
679104 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
679105 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
679106 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
679107 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people
679108 i dont want to make it any tougher for him what we need to do is rally behind the leader we have got rather than speculate about leaders that we might have had once and sadly have not yet had and probably never will
679109 if he wants to change his mind he is entitled to do so in his own good time and he will let us know in his own good time
679110 i would be rolling out the red carpet for him tomorrow if he wanted to stay in the parliament but its all hypothetical because he hasnt given us any indication other than the one back in december that he was going
679111 we all wish that he would come back but he has given no indication that he would

679116 we would like to reiterate the fact that abhishek bachchan continues to be the brand ambassador for flying machine
679117 flying machine is pleased to be associated with an icon like abhishek who personifies the brand impeccable style and youthfulness and will continue the association as initially planned
679118 i was confident we would come back we have done that in past one look at the dressing room shows you how much potential and quality this team has overall we played very well in this test match and everybody contributed
679119 this team has been through ups and downs and it has a fair amount of experience and quality there was no doubt that we will regroup and come back hard i am really proud of the way we played this test
679120 the way he scored runs in both innings was great gautams contributions also were vital but veeru getting those 201 runs in a total of 329 is something amazing taking that forward into the second innings is never easy but he batted brilliantly and gave us another strong start

679137 four people were killed and nine others were injured after a crude bomb exploded in garbage dump the incident happened when some ragpickers went to collect plastic pouches from the dump
679138 as they were scourging through the dumping ground they found the bomb and ignorantly tried to break it and that caused the explosion
679139 he fell about as far as you can and he wants to prove to the world that hes not only innocent but that hes back
679140 he beat the legal rap but on wall street all you really have is your reputation and he took a hit to his
679141 hes going to have to dig himself out of that and maybe he will and maybe he wont

679147 we were the gamut composers john cage and i got it from henry cowell cowell from charles seeger and later we discovered that virgil thomson and alan hovhaness were doing it too
679148 could one draw a line extending from satie through cage and feldman skipping over or around both serialism and minimalism to the postminimalists showing the rise of a new way of thinking about music as a nonsyntactic play among discrete sonic objects
679149 if there is a difference its that the postminimalist limitations of bill duckworths music and janice gitecks and john luther adamss tend to fall within a system or a scale or a logical set of rhythms deployed over a certain range while cage selected the elements of his gamuts for maximum disjunction and diversity but thats a tenuous disctinction
679150 began transmitting music over phone lines central studios played records the first 33 1 3 rpm records and the first ever done on vinylite rather than shellac
679151 whereas in the 1930s muzak was essentially the same as popular music and radio by the 1940s it had gone its own way creating a different level of attention and its own medium muzak had pioneered the use of long playing 33 1 3 rpm records in order to create more seamless soundscapes for its functional music
679152 oh those awful composers they were elitists they wrote ugly music on purpose yada yada yada
679153 there are many emphasis mine musicians and composers of experimental works who seemingly compete for the title of most obscure and most difficult for the listener and even record collectors like to play along
679154 are you now or have you ever been an academic composer
679155 i began to think a whole lot less of our audience
679156 not every composer who writes thorny complex difficult to understand music is a genius there have been people who wrote thorny complex difficult to understand music because it was trendy because it would help get them tenure because it was easier to look down their noses at audiences for not understanding than it was to write really good music etc
679157 as classical music followed this bizarre perverted road for some half of the 20th century the audiences left in droves
679158 this is normal for think tanks worldwide it takes time to build up the staff the shared interdisciplinary work the clientele the resources to achieve impact
679159 there are big black holes in the research for example one of the ideas which came up in the institute which demonstrates how we think about the unthinkable is to try to make jewish education in the united states free of charge but there are no studies on this
679160 it makes sense that if jewish education were free many more parents would send their children to jewish schools but this is not assured its merely a proposition a hypothesis a speculation nobody did an experiment there is no survey we know of where parents are asked systematically if they would send their children to a free jewish school
679161 thinking the unthinkable there will be a need in the future for a conceptual revolution for radical policy innovations this takes time and in order to convince you need data
679162 is not obvious somebody can tell us rightly that the orthodox community in america sends its kids to jewish schools even when it costs a lot of money
679163 a social experiment lets get two communities to open their schools for free and see what happens if it goes well with a solid evidence based demonstration it will be easier to convince others its also an opportunity to do costing
679164 we do meta analysis we rely on work done by others field studies are very expensive and require a different specialization its up to the jewish communities in the united states to do this
679165 it is a term used in medicine when they take 50 to 60 studies on the impact of penicillin on pregnant women and integrate them into an over arching analysis we do analysis based on field studies and data collected by others were not a data collecting body we cannot be we are not and we dont want to be
679166 that there is no shared meeting of the heads of jewish organizations in the states
679167 the heads of the organizations are not necessarily the future but it is necessary to get them together for an aspen type retreat for a frank exchange of views and experiences this is not happening if there was such a meeting we would go there to present our china study
679168 this is a study with good very cheap recommendations what is 1 million a year everyone agrees its a good proposition but it has not been implemented
679169 doesnt fit into the decision making culture of israel which is a culture of improvisation this proved itself in the establishment period the state is a great success and its first 60 years are a heroic achievement but it doesnt assure the future
679170 the concerns of the jewish people are taken into account
679171 20 central issues on which the israeli government has no policy im not speaking about the current government the news that the israeli government doesnt do policy thinking is not new why should the government have a policy on the jewish people if it doesnt have one on income disparity with exceptional cases in some special domains the government is not oriented to long term strategy it doesnt have the staff units the professionals or the culture
679172 my starting point is the future of the jewish people which is not assured the biggest challenge is the detachment between israel and the diaspora young israelis and young jews in the united states live in a different cosmos the communities have totally different structures and how many israeli ministers even understand whats going on in the diaspora
679173 that would study american jewry and be staffed with people with deep personal knowledge of american jewry
679174 israelis of the next generation who are much more israelis than jews
679175 and i dont mean sending money to the poor im not against a jewish peace corps but this also isnt what i mean i think that without giving a sense of pride in the jewish people among those without religion the motivation to belong will go down
679176 i regard humanity as on a dangerous slippery slope the human capacity to influence its future grows exponentially while its moral and cognitive capacities what to do with this power is more or less stable
679177 the world is full of problems that need a new ethics including the question of poverty and equality in globalization the problem of a modern version of amalek enemies of humanity mass terror groups the possibilities of space travel what to do about bioengineering and the possibility of cloning human beings creating a different kind of homo sapiens superior i think these are continuity breaking types of knowledge
679178 ethical problems for the next age of humanity in this israel can be a medinat mofet exemplary state a modern version of a light unto the nations this is good in terms of realpolitik and it is a moral imperative
679179 the jewish peoples think tank needs a billion dollar endowment or we must get outstanding political leaders or we must get outstanding jewish value creators spiritual leaders id prefer the third option but
679180 i dont know how to engineer it how to craft politicians i have some ideas how to craft policies i have many ideas but how to develop spiritual leaders rabbi yosef soloveitchik avraham heschel ahad haam and rabbi avraham yitzhak kook if it were up to me id set up tomorrow an institute for advanced ethical jewish thinking get the best thinkers for two years then terminate it
679181 i proposed sponsoring a game called jewish civilization it would be a money maker i contacted the company which makes civilization and they say developing such a game would cost a million dollars or two not so much
679182 prepare five core curricula different so each stream can pick what it likes
679183 wed love to have someone dealing with cultural studies of the jewish people at the institute in our last annual assessment for the first time we succeeded to put in something on culture namely on jewish cinema
679184 i agree with you i would love to see the institute deal with this but there are no quantitative criteria for measuring it if we could bring about a pluralistic jewish renaissance id give up everything else for this it would have an impact on policy on leaders but this is deus ex machina and i dont know how to generate it the literature on cultural renaissances is open ended creativity is a black box i dont know how to craft policy for this

679200 for the good of the institute it should not depend on a person of my age
679201 im not sure we have the institutions and the leadership spiritual and political to deal with adjusting to the 21st century
679202 maybe my frustration is the result of not being patient enough those processes take time the institute is new the idea of a jewish think tank is new
679203 im now 80 i could have died at 70 and i would not have had the winograd committee experience the institute the israel prize but im eager to get home im tired of this business winograd was a great burden though it was an unequaled unique experience in life

679213 the assumption going into this year is you can take your base salary or severance thats the choice theres a resignation in the market
679214 right now we see the volume of opportunistic hiring is also reduced
679215 and the key thing during a downturn is keeping your job
679216 if you look at ism and the unemployment number together it suggests an economy that is at best stuck in neutral
679217 but we are forecasting continued growth in the economy for the back half of the year and it will be that growth that will determine a return to job creation
679218 with job losses mounting prices rising increased turbulence in our financial system a growing credit crunch we need to do more
679219 we are clearly in a growth recession and my fear is that we are in a mild but longer recession than the one we experienced in 2001 2002
679220 overall the report looks to be broadly consistent with other data that show the economy quite soft basically stalled not growing very much but not contracting very much either

679225 here is a former captain who comes back to a team and is no longer captain
679226 theres no animosity no resentment he went to our new captain and tried to see what he could do to help him and what he could do to make him better it shows you what kind of kid he is
679227 its kind of like a proving you wrong kind of thing

679229 georgia tech is going to be a force to reckon with
679230 once the guys down there understand the offense and know what to do and why theyre doing it the acc is going to be in for a big surprise
679231 i think theyre going to do well this offense a lot of the teams in the acc havent seen it so its definitely going to be a good team in the future
679232 i dont know how those guys down there do it i just talked to coach jeff monken my old position coach last week and i was asking him how are the guys doing down there he told me right now theyre struggling its hard for a drop back passer to go into that offense hence their quarterback taylor bennett transferred its just hard on a lot of guys a lot of those linemen with all that pulling theyre not used to that
679233 im sure theyre staying pretty basic with them right now because they need a guy who knows how to run the offense its going to be tough for them i came from a shotgun no huddle offense to coming here and running the triple it was a big change but theyre good coaches theyll figure it out

679254 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
679255 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans

679274 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
679275 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
679276 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
679277 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
679278 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
679279 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
679280 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
679281 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
679282 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
679283 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
679284 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
679285 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
679286 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
679287 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
679288 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
679289 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
679290 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
679291 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
679292 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
679293 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
679294 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
679295 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
679296 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
679297 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

679302 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
679303 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
679304 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
679305 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
679306 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight

679308 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
679309 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
679310 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
679311 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
679312 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
679313 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
679314 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
679315 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
679316 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
679317 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
679318 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
679319 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
679320 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
679321 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
679322 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
679323 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
679324 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
679325 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
679326 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
679327 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
679328 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
679329 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
679330 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
679331 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
679332 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

679340 we had 70 000 people trying to buy tickets this year and each of them wanted to buy at least two so you can see the demand is there
679341 we want to make it slightly bigger without losing the feel of the festival
679342 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
679343 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
679344 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
679345 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
679346 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
679347 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

679356 youve felt anger though and sadness and the physical pain
679357 its like im acting those things i think youre protecting me from the worst of it like youre the helpful monster inside my head
679358 you should keep taking them at night they help you sleep
679359 youre planning to do something with them use them as an overdose
679360 it goes across the sea to other islands like this one its easier to walk to them than it is to row there

679362 really what about that other place you took me is that a better place or a worse place
679363 you said it was lost that woman wants you to find her
679364 the one on the cliff in that other dream she really needs your help
679365 during the dream and then afterwards i like her she doesnt try to force me out like you do sometimes
679366 you make suggestions like all of the time sometimes it really pisses me off whats that road made of glass
679367 fuck thats cool do you ride them like in the books
679368 i dont know sometimes she says funny things about people how stupid they are or when i ought to listen to what they say shes a bit like my mum looking out for me though she likes it when i get into trouble she doesnt mind about the sex not like you
679369 does she talk to you a lot has she said anything about me
679370 no just now and then she said you can be a bit thick at times but im not to get in your way because youve got to go and find her
679371 has she mentioned the band i mean a ring to you at all
679372 i know its there she told me about it said it wasnt a good idea to look at it
679373 like forever shes always been there like an invisible friend when youre a kid except mine never went away but i never saw her not until you took me to her in that dream so if you dont ride these dragons what do you do with them
679374 feldman goes out there and pitches his tail off its frustrating to see him pitch that well and then lose the game its my fault that we lost that game

679406 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
679407 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
679408 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
679409 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
679410 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
679411 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest

679431 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
679432 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
679433 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
679434 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
679435 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
679436 im looking at 10 days ahead and i dont see any big break
679437 to be this critical and have the fire conditions we have now is unusual for this time of year
679438 it had been there for many years and probably would be there for many more
679439 now i guess there might be more people making a pilgrimage to these glaciers before they go
679440 ice is almost like a species that is going extinct
679441 its the far north and the higher elevations that are seeing the impacts first
679442 and when it comes to california it doesnt get any higher than the sierra
679443 when i started doing climate change research in the sierra nevada around 1990 it seemed like an abstraction
679444 over the last five years the canary in the coal mine died
679445 its almost a shock to find out how many things are changing and how rapidly they are changing
679446 its doing this not in tens of thousands of years but in decades
679447 we are going into new territory that has not been seen in a long long time
679448 despite their imposing grandeur and apparent fortitude mountains contain highly sensitive environments that support delicately balanced physical and natural systems a warming of only a few degrees has major implications
679449 its like throwing a switch you get water or you get ice
679450 this winter there were a number of storms in yosemite valley where it was just kind of spitting snow but it never really got cold enough to snow
679451 a few degrees makes a fair amount of difference when sap starts rising plants begin to grow and insects become active
679452 it could very well be that giant sequoias become relics that survive for centuries where they are as they gradually die off and are not replaced
679453 there is going to be a great deal of nail biting there are going to be constant surprises for everyone
679454 resorts would be forced to rely entirely on snowmaking or move their operations
679455 when i was a kid i used to spend close to nine months a year in my ski boots
679456 you can only go up so far before you run out of mountain
679457 its just a single pine thats the insidious part sometimes you dont notice it because its a tree here and a tree there but there used to be a lot more there and today there are very few
679458 the less snow you have the more severe the fire becomes
679459 if the snow melts earlier the fuels are available for a longer period of time
679460 what a great experience what a jumble of fascination great ice pool
679461 there used to be a massive tongue of ice here
679462 the key thing is all the ice loss is occurring about the same time all these caves are being influenced by a common factor which is more than likely global climate change
679463 on the whole sierra nevada glaciers have retreated roughly 50 percent from a century ago
679464 if those rates continue we will probably be without glaciers in something like 50 years
679465 floats as a pale ship on a sea of desolate granite
679466 the east lobe is almost invisible you see a thin flake of ice like the stuff in a refrigerator that doesnt defrost
679467 the west lobe is more healthy but it has shriveled and shrunken the way a pumpkin does four weeks after halloween
679468 it wont be long until the lyell glacier is no more two or three more decades maybe
679469 i set out to trace the ancient ice current back to its farthest recesses
679470 a small but well characterized glacier swooping down from the somber precipices of black mountain
679471 the seven detained bahai believers have confessed to setting up an illegal organization in iran that took orders from israel and others to undermine the islamic system
679472 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
679473 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
679474 the seriousness of the allegations makes us fear for the lives of these seven individuals
679475 we deny in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that bahais in iran have engaged in any subversive activity
679476 the bahai community is not involved in political affairs their only crime is the practice of their religion
679477 the seriousness of the allegations makes us fear for the lives of these seven individuals
679478 that is no secret the government knew perfectly well about the existence of this committee long before its members were arrested just as the government knows perfectly well that these people are not involved in any underhanded activity
679479 suggestions of collusion with the state of israel are categorically false and misleading the iranian authorities are playing on the fact that the bahai world administrative center is located in northern israel
679480 the iranian government completely ignores the well known historical fact that the bahai faith was centered in iran until 1853 when the authorities there banished the bahai prophet founder who was forced into exile and eventually imprisoned in acre on the mediterranean coast under the ottoman turkish regime that area happens to be in what is now israel
679481 i turned a small rock and found it hiding underneath
679482 this was my first make a wish experience getting to meet all the circle of champions honorees robert in particular stood out to me as a kid with an incredible fighting spirit it was an emotional meeting but at the same time it was very uplifting for me it makes you appreciate each and every day and know how important it is not to take anything for granted
679483 the olympiad cycle was a very simple four year cycle and you dont need a sophisticated instrument like this to calculate it it took us by huge surprise when we saw this
679484 but the games were of such cultural and social importance that its not unnatural to have it in the mechanism
679485 it dawned on me that i didnt need to go to far off places or engage in
679486 motherhood is a beautiful container of the virtues we need to develop
679487 while monks and nuns in different faiths devote themselves to develop unconditional love selfless service good will joy for others happiness and the ability to let go these are actually what mothers do in their everyday life
679488 i saw he returned from a retreat clear and calm so i decided to give it a try i was amazed at how calm i felt
679489 i just watched the pain being aware of each moment without thinking
679490 it taught me that we cannot escape pain but suffering is an option
679491 when confused or in a bad mood dont deny it just see it observe it dont fight against it surrender and watch it without judgement and the dark feeling will miraculously dissolve by itself
679492 with space you can look at things fresh and solutions will come from that
679493 motherhood gives us a glimpse of unconditional love it expands our capacity to love to give and to empathize with others in difficult situations
679494 upekkha or onlooking equanimity is the ability to observe struggles joys and all other states of the mind with open and loving detachment
679495 upekkha comes from the realization that pain is part of growth and human condition it is the courage to look on lovingly at things we cannot change its the courage to let our children be who they are to accept that we dont have control that we can only influence
679496 thats why mothering is a direct path to spiritual insight
679497 tough love demands letting our children experience the consequences without interfering but with deep love in our hearts
679498 everything that happens can be used as a gate to enlightenment
679499 if angry use it as a gate by not resisting it not thinking that you
679500 by not resisting it it disappears by not giving anger any more power it fades its incredible then there will be more peace in the home

679548 extensive scientific and medical experience has demonstrated it is an effective anti depressant
679549 the difference in improvement between patients taking placebos and patients taking anti depressants is not very great
679550 this means that depressed people can improve without chemical treatments
679551 given these results there seems little reason to prescribe anti depressant medication to any but the most severely depressed patients unless alternative treatments have failed to provide a benefit
679552 if these results were upheld in further studies they would be very disturbing
679553 the newer anti depressants were the great hope for the future these findings could remove what has been seen as a vital choice for thousands in treating what can be a life threatening condition
679554 we have become vastly over reliant on antidepressants when there is a range of alternatives

679563 it cant be understated that he is from our neighboring state
679564 barack obama coming up here and competing here is going to force john mccain to make a choice
679565 for everything that mccain does up here thats a little bit less that he can do in these big battleground states we always hear about
679566 there is a real sense of energy coming off that campaign that is completely lacking from the other side

679574 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
679575 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either

679577 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
679578 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
679579 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet
679580 there is no open place for them to play there is no park they are living with their mothers inside the prison in the room

679582 if i go outside i can help my sister cook and wash the clothes i can study go to the mosque study the quran and when i come home i can help my sister wash the dishes
679583 i cant let my children be taken to an orphanage because i have many enemies who may kidnap them
679584 some of my enemies are even in prison and they ask about me if my children were in an orphanage i would not feel that they were safe
679585 if i can get paid to do that then im in

679606 were a brand thats constantly trying to innovate we speak to the innovators the early adopters it makes sense for us because art just inspires and we want to inspire as a brand and with what we do
679607 i think the artwork does the talking but we have other ideas that we want to do together
679608 the artwork is the centerpiece but we are part of it
679609 i wouldnt draw a line between design and fine art at all
679610 artworks are designed all i do is put together colors and shapes for people to look at and thats what designers do im making products just like a designer
679611 were very price conscious and if its a very fashionable piece well do it in our private label
679612 we wanted someone to find a top for 34 and walk away happy
679613 we were at the bottom of the ladder and you climb up one rung at a time
679614 we started off as a party store where people would find something to go out in

679622 im trying to get out of the five pocket syndrome
679623 when i was at seven in the beginning we had a philosophy like that i think they went off in another direction now so i wanted to continue what i did at seven but evolve it
679624 the concept i think is great for anything really like shirts and t shirts

679664 speedy conclusion and successful outcome of the talks so that we can focus on the recovery of our economy
679665 would rather collapse or not move forward unless mugabe is offered a ceremonial post or forced to retire
679666 we will simply walk out of the talks and there are no two ways about it and that is why we have come up with two key works in ndebele and shona we have said if mugabe refuses to step down under the talks then busa sibone or tonga tione

679670 i am glad its sorted and that is the most important thing i can say now that i am an official player of bolton

679672 right now i am at sporting and will continue to give everything for sporting but the future belongs to god as i have said in all the years that i am here
679673 its difficult to keep them i think we have a good youth system which is very important to ajax but its been like this for the last 25 years
679674 its important to keep players for as long as possible maybe with money maybe with other promises
679675 the possibilities are better for the game against portsmouth than they were before
679676 i am happy because i saw players go up in their level from training and the last game
679677 it was not the normal milan they had four or fives players out big players with quality but our team played very well and the performance today was better than the four earlier games
679678 this game was important for nicolas anelka but more important for us the fans the coach and the other players who will have more confidence in him
679679 today was good not because he scored four goals but because he played more free and with more quality than in other games
679680 he was playing against a big club and to get four goals against milan for his confidence it is fantastic and anelka today and the last game played more inside the penalty area than before
679681 people kept asking me about the appearance record when i was trying to win the premier league and champions league so it is a relief not to have it there any more
679682 of course i am proud to have done it but now i just want to move on hopefully add a few more games to the total and focus on the team
679683 there is a stigma of celebrity and money alongside football these days which is different from when i first came into the team
679684 now you see players with nice cars and 18 year olds on good money
679685 but its down to the individual having the right attitude and application its not enough just to have the talent
679686 rest assured well give it our best shot to win it
679687 i think its in everybodys best interest now you get yourself into a final to do what we can
679688 we came across pretty confident but at half time i was wondering where that confidence has gone
679689 i think we backed ourselves we knew with the results today what we had to do and a win would get a home final so weve achieved that

679749 the 2001 anthrax attacks remain one of the great mysteries of the post 9 11 era after 9 11 itself the anthrax attacks were probably the most consequential event of the bush presidency one could make a persuasive case that they were actually more consequential the 9 11 attacks were obviously traumatic for the country but in the absence of the anthrax attacks 9 11 could easily have been perceived as a single isolated event it was really the anthrax letters with the first one sent on september 18 just one week after 9 11 that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after it was anthrax sent directly into the heart of the countrys elite political and media institutions to then senate majority leader tom daschle d sd sen pat leahy d vt nbc news anchor tom brokaw and other leading media outlets that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by islamic radicalism if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab sent by a top u s army scientist at ft detrick without resort to any speculation or inferences at all it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact from the beginning there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both islamic radicals and the 9 11 attacks one other fact to note here is how bizarrely inept the effort by the bush doj to find the real attacker has been extremely suspicious behavior from ivins including his having found and completely cleaned anthrax traces on a desk at the ft detrick lab without telling anyone that he did so and then offering extremely strange explanations for why was publicly reported as early as 2004 by the la times ivins detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it ivins considered the problem solved when he cleaned the affected office with bleach
679750 it is hypocritical for bill keffer who claims to be the champion of morality to continue accepting pete sessions political patronage and strip club money he should denounce congressman sessions for using a strip club venue to raise money and he should return the monies given to him by sessions or that sessions helped him raise for use in his own campaign

679761 the nose is one of the bodys filters so cleansing the nasal passages of dust and allergens that cause inflammation is crucial for good respiratory health
679762 while most people think of allergies as an inconvenience symptoms can worsen leading to an infection or sinusitis simple preventive methods such as saline nasal wash in a squeeze bottle can be used daily over the long term to reduce or alleviate sinus symptoms

679775 the problem that i see isnt the number of immigrants that are coming we are actually advantaged by the number of immigrants coming we need to provide a pathway for citizenship for those undocumented workers who are here who have put down roots frankly we are probably underrepresented when it comes to immigrants from certain parts of the world its harder for haitians to immigrate than it is for persons from other countries in some cases thats something we need to prevent

679804 we are not being distracted by this gentlemans filing state republican party chairman ron carey said
679805 i dont know of any resource any time that is being spent on this so called challenge he added
679806 i just developed a bond for the united states said immelman whose campaign highlights national security public safety and immigration reform as the top issues
679807 since 2004 ive been advocating vigorously against the iraq war i am not an anti war candidate i am against wars that undermine u s national security and waste taxpayer dollars and weaken dollars because of the money thats being borrowed
679808 its bad policy to give in effect amnesty to people who came in illegally he said
679809 it encourages the exact same behavior you are trying to discourage i dont advocate mass deportation but we need to have verifiable border security before we come up with humane solutions
679810 to independents and even some democrats for whom foreign policy is an issue and who believe we made a mistake invading iraq we need to admit that mistake and move on
679811 its a sign of pareidolia which is what its called when you see faces in random things clouds the moon mars tortillas truly this is a miraculously improbable confluence of random chance
679812 the one criticism of economics that annoys me the most is the charge that economics is unrealistic because economists think people are only motivated by money this is stupid basic economic theory says that people seek to maximize utility which is generally defined as a persons level of satisfaction if you think basic economic models assume that people are only motivated by money then im sorry but you fundamentally dont understand what economics is all about

679819 of course i feel a little bit sorry for felipe i know how he feels with what happened to him today ive had similar moments to him this year
679820 i just tried to put pressure on massa hoping something would happen
679821 it worked out for me im very very glad to secure the victory
679822 we had the speed in the race its qualifying where we must sort it out
679823 we need to get something sorted my car is fast and we need to just get in the front to use it
679824 when i saw the car on fire on the straight the smoke i thought it could be felipe but couldnt believe it
679825 i just tried not to do any mistakes and stay in front of him
679826 i didnt expect the podium its just the perfect weekend
679827 they had some gaps there and i just took advantage of them the ball found me and i was able to make them pay
679828 in that kind of situation where the game is kind of seesawing back and forth we have so many weapons it could be lebron it could be d wade one of us is going to kick into high gear
679829 its great to be so far from staples center and still have so much support i feel like im home
679830 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter
679831 if you take a look in past games the american team most points they score is fast breaks and its dunks i think for the most part we contained the ball
679832 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
679833 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense
679834 just did a great job of being aggressive so he played well
679835 it has never been done before i doubt it will be repeated this is it weve got a golden opportunity to fast forward our research
679836 i immediately jumped off my seat i thought this is what ive been waiting for i said thank god for the olympics for me this is 10 times better than winning the lottery
679837 if mother nature cooperates i expect there would be an impact but it all depends on the wind directions
679838 its a giant science experiment on air pollution as far as i know its the biggest case where a city that had air quality problems took strong measures to improve air quality theyve taken it very seriously its exciting from a science standpoint
679839 they didnt have to go to quite the extremes that beijing has beijing has had to come a long way further than l a or atlanta
679840 its not just about china its about megacities across the world whats learned here can perhaps be applied to other cities
679841 i hope the sky can stay blue like this both during and after the olympic games
679842 this will give foreigners a good impression of the city and leave a legacy to beijing citizens
679843 its much better than i expected theres none of the gunk in the air
679844 there is a little haze in the air but that reminds me of los angeles in 1984 but its nothing like ive been reading about
679845 a safe olympics is the biggest indicator of the success of the games
679846 a safe olympics is also a key indicator of the positive reflection of our nations image
679847 protest by athletes doesnt really mar the games because that is something even the ioc would be opposed to
679848 but i think major protests that the chinese put down in front of television cameras particularly if they are foreign protesters that could look very bad
679849 were taking things a day at a time but i was able to do good bars today
679850 if i dont have written proof of something we have to take for granted the passports that weve seen and have been checked by the ioc are ok
679851 the ioc relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of athletes
679852 its not the task of the ioc to check every one of the 10 000 athletes
679853 its just as grave and just as brutal like cheating with doping
679854 the international gymnastics federation strictly verified their passports and confirmed that their ages met the age rules for participating in the world championship world cup and olympics
679855 a passport does nothing passports at this point in china is nothing they can do anything
679856 i dont believe you have to be a child psychologist or doctor to look at those particular girls and say wait a minute these are kids they are not 16 years old not a doubt in my mind
679857 you can test for lots of drugs but theres really no carbon dating
679858 other than believing what they say where is the truth if you have to look for some independent source i dont know
679859 its going to take time the games are good for us playing against the competition that is here latvia is one of the best teams weve seen
679860 despite the focus we had on her and the different people we had on her she managed to get shots off shes a quality player
679861 she could have played in the second half but since these games dont mean anything we didnt put her back in
679862 america is one of the best teams in the tournament
679863 we were looking for some new ideas and mr chen has certainly brought those to us
679864 he has taken us from a development level to the top level
679865 my family is really happy im here and they can watch me coach at the olympics
679866 i think they will cheer for both the americans and chinese no problem with that i have so many friends here so it feels like being at home
679867 he is definitely leaving soon to go to green bay

679889 i visit her every day that i am not out with the band and talk to her about what is going on with the band and how well the new album is doing her family and close friends are also at her bedside every day
679890 thank you to everyone who has sent messages of support to debbie and to me a lot of them i have read out to debbie in hospital
679891 she has worked so hard to get the band going and to make the new album possible that i feel it is important to continue with what she has started for us

679895 bruce told me that all of them had been detained at different locations his children and his wife and then himself and they were extensively questioned and they told his wife and his children some disturbing things about their father being a murderer
679896 i think simply bruce was a high strung person and very sensitive and this pressure was just simply adding to his depression that ultimately caused him to kill himself
679897 deep in my heart i wont believe he had anything to do with it until i see him in the afterlife and he says yeah i did it russ thats the only way im really going to believe it deep in my heart thats the truth
679898 after all of my sincere concern for him over these last 6 months the constant pain of missing him waking up and physically hurting because hes not there and how hollow all of my attempts at dating have been because my heart was truly

679908 copyright law has abandoned its reason for being to encourage learning and the creation of new works instead its principal functions now are to preserve existing failed business models to suppress new business models and technologies and to obtain if possible enormous windfall profits from activity that not only causes no harm but which is beneficial to copyright owners like dumpty the copyright law we used to know can never be put back together again multilateral and trade agreements have ensured that and quite deliberately

679912 he told me that day he said hey if i needed to make a decision today i would retire
679913 we thought for sure he was going to come back
679914 i thought he was working just going through the process and he needed more time
679915 he felt at this point we had reached a point of closure
679916 those were his words and he was going to stick with his initial decision
679917 but he mentioned several things where there was always indecisiveness or he was wondering if he made the right decision i think thats normal
679918 you and ted need to have a plan if i do come back
679919 either give me my helmet or give me my release
679920 he said no no im not saying im there yet
679921 james was put in a tough spot and i think hes totally been wrongly illustrated in this
679922 were trying to be as respectful to him and his legacy as possible but thats an important piece of the puzzle
679923 as an organization ted and i thats the first time any communication to us was he was committed to play

679926 the combination of efficiency power performance and design make the a4 the new segment standard
679927 these are all new models with added standard features versus the previous generation and the a4 when equipped with the all new 2 0 tfsi engine and quattro all wheel drive system delivers better fuel economy and acceleration than the key competitors in this segment
679928 especially after the a4 hit the auto show circuit and photos started to appear consumer interest increased as fuel prices rose the new 2 0 tfsi is a great engine add the new engine to the beautiful design and incredible vehicle technology and i feel that this is the perfect car for the time

679973 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
679974 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim

679976 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
679977 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
679978 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
679979 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
679980 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
679981 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country

679985 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
679986 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
679987 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
679988 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
