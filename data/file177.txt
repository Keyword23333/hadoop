1770006 when they got close she hid her head behind the lifesaver like a little kid who hides behind a curtain and doesnt realize his toes are sticking out
1770007 this is a problem up and down the coast particularly on docks
1770008 she was so busy snapping pictures she forgot to bring the ladder up
1770009 hed just turn his nose up to the sun and just look at us like im here so what it was just the darndest thing
1770010 ive never seen anything so preposterous and ive been sailing for years and years
1770011 ernies acknowledgement of the role that his staff has played in the programs success reached the point that he was willing to deflect substantial personal gain to aid the continued growth of the program
1770012 that speaks a lot not only for the commitment he has for his players and staff but also the university and this community
1770013 i am honored to have been the head basketball coach at the university of oregon for the last 11 years
1770014 but our work here has just started i want to build on the momentum and excitement that has been generated from our recent success and take this program to the next level
1770015 were simply better when it really counts i feel so happy

1770022 we were 23rd in the gold fleet at the europeans at istanbul last year and 16th at the junior europeans in holland it is great to be doing so well at our first worlds here in athens there is more to come
1770023 here there are short waves not the longer sea waves of tel aviv
1770024 in istanbul there were maybe ten top performing sailors here the standard of the top 40 is all very high it is very impressive
1770025 we were selected at two five day regatta the experience here is great the competition is strong the best in the world are here

1770030 in israel it does not come from the shore we sail away from the beach

1770032 mccain cant afford to have the sun on his gace nor can he take the media spotlight and win

1770044 that in my opinion would be unworkable it would be a major major issue for the crusaders
1770045 its far better and simpler for franchises to contract their own players the crusaders should have a guarantee of knowing who their players are
1770046 i dont know what is going to happen with tasman but if it is not around again then franchise contracting needs to be introduced very very soon
1770047 we have an appetite for rugby here and we cant satisfy it the hurricanes have no manawatu players and little appeal to people in the manawatu thats the disconnect thats occurred
1770048 weve a better chance of getting a highlanders game than a hurricanes game
1770049 we believe its viable and we have some people prepared to underwrite it
1770050 we believe we will fill the stadium so long as there are some manawatu boys in the highlanders team those two players are a huge part of this community

1770053 theres nothing better than playing test cricket for england and from what ive seen this morning harmy bowled a hell of a spell to fred andrew flintoff in the nets so if he bowls anything like that this week hell be back properly
1770054 the big feature of my captaincy is to get back to playing with a real amount of pride and passion and to try and play with confidence and without fear
1770055 the recipe for success that i use is to play my way to play without fear and be confident and once we go over the white line to just express yourself and do whatever you need to do to be successful
1770056 yes i think it did i think there was a bit of worrying about stuff too much worrying about little things

1770080 leon is improving but the medical advice is to take things slowly
1770081 hell gradually get back into exercise and then training and then may look to play a match for canterbury
1770082 if he is unable to commit to that then i would think that precludes him from taking up a full time contract of course he can still play when he is available as a free agent for match fees as he did last season
1770083 i think there has been too much bending over backwards to not upset india
1770084 i really enjoyed the four day stuff with hampshire and was quite successful so i was hoping to get in as many games as i can for canterbury

1770093 when you draw that crap on there its like youre defacing my face
1770094 my problem is the word attaining persevering is not a necessary evidence of justification but it actually attains justification
1770095 to present the biblical case for a completed once for all justification a justification which has no future aspect
1770096 enduring to the end is not a condition of attaining final salvation or justification
1770097 but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved
1770098 perseverance is a means by which one will be saved
1770099 to achieve or accomplish to arrive at esp after some labor or tedium
1770100 but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved
1770101 t he text says the one who perseveres to the end will be saved
1770102 jesus words indicate that perseverance to the end is the necessary condition perseverance is a means that god has appointed by which one will be saved
1770103 at times we will use the words condition and means interchangeably when we use the word means we use it in the sense that perseverance is a necessary means that god has appointed for attaining final salvation
1770104 we essentially concur with john pipers discussion of conditional promises for his discussion see the purifying power of living by faith in future grace sisters ore multnomah 1995 pp 231 59
1770105 their emphasis must not be missed perseverance is not merely an evidence of salvation or that through which we enter into final salvation
1770106 the consequence of perseverance salvation not yet attained into the cause of perseverance salvation already possessed
1770107 is both biblically and theologically accurate but the text we are examining does not say that it is a case of good theology but from the wrong verse
1770108 perseverance is not that through which we enter into final salvation
1770109 to attain salvation by perseverance is to work for it
1770110 a primary dictionary definition of attain is to achieve or accomplish to arrive at esp after some labor or tedium
1770111 therefore to speak of attaining salvation is the language of works whether it is said to be so or not
1770112 that by any means possible i may attain the resurrection from the dead
1770113 present a paper later in the campaign showing that claims of global warming have no basis in science and therefore do not apply to the world in which we live

1770193 do not do unto others what you do not want them to do unto you
1770194 ive just found a pot of marmite i bought last year and compared it with a new one and yes the salt reduction programme has been implemented the sodium level has gone down from 4 3 to 3 9 and maybe to compensate for this carbohydrate level has increased from 19 2 to a massive 24 with sugar going up from o 5 to 1 1
1770195 i have the proof marmite has changed i have an old jar that i keep at my mother in laws in austria for when we visit it has a best before date of march 03 it is pretty much black in colour tastes far better with no nasty after taste spreads slightly firmer and is just the real marmite taste
1770196 you take the blue pill and the story ends you wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
1770197 you take the red pill you wake in your bed and stay in wonderland you take the blue pill and unfortunately for you the story doesnt end and you will probably never find out how deep the rabbit hole goes
1770198 the story that i am about to tell you is one of a king
1770199 vandetto was a great man one who brought not only prosperity to leonia but respect as well he brought a respect to his kingdom that had not been seen in these castle walls since the days of the slayers but prosperity and respect do not protect you from deceit and lies millcor wanted the throne he knew vandetto would reign king for season after season and he could not wait he took his brothers throne and had him thrown from the kingdom that vandetto himself had returned to greatness
1770200 i saw what happened to the king i watched as he screamed in the night as his flesh was torn from his body in blood soaked strips
1770201 i could have intervened yes probably should have i could have also been on that torture rack next to him if i had it was best to stay hidden like the coward i am and be able to pass the story of your kings last moments in life onto you
1770202 the demon creatures the horde tortured him for information but he would speak nothing to them they peeled his body of its flesh revealing his age weakened muscles as they did they tore at him burned his eyes with hot pikes they cut his fingers from his hands to make him speak of his people and their warriors but he would not no for vandetto was a noble man a man of no regrets and a man who did not betray his people the horde made his screams echo into the night air made him almost lose his mind as they tortured him vandetto would not break though he would not die
1770203 until the exact moment came the exact moment to strike
1770204 i crept up on one of the torturers as his companion headed into the dark forest no doubt to gather more devices to torture the great vandetto with this very dagger i drew blood from his throat watching in satisfaction as he drowned in his own lifeblood
1770205 i approached the bloodied and beaten vandetto his gasps for air rattled in my ears as he spoke to me his one eye staring at me as his last words escaped his lips take this ring he told me
1770206 he told me to bring it here to leonia and show his people that he fought to the end that he died not in vain but for the people that he loved
1770207 who dares speak to me in such a manner you must be the son of a local whore only a bastard would have such attitude
1770208 you speak to me as though i were a thief i who ended your kings suffering he no doubt glares at you from the heavens above
1770209 i see you have not lost that scar i gave you so long ago but i seem to remember feasting on your eye when i took it looks as if the gods gave you another
1770210 i took it from your wench of a mother when i slit her from navel to neck speaking of feasting she had the sweetest loin that i can ever remember tasting and my eye i wont let you get that close again demon
1770211 i was young then a mere student of the slayer
1770212 now i am all that is left thanks to spawn like you spawn that i am going to personally see wiped off this planet
1770213 tell nehemiah that demon bastard that i send my regards when you see him in the underworld
1770214 the horde i thought those demons were fairy tales told to keep children in bed
1770215 do you recall hearing about the slain cattle outside of mcfarland or of the missing carriages carrying the royal family of lathrop that was the horde they have been making their way to us to our realm they are coming for leonia
1770216 does the book of the slayer remain unopened in this day have i not told you to read it
1770217 there are three points in the world that are directly connected to the underworld
1770218 the first is in the realm of plourde near the city kingdom of rosewood
1770219 the second point is on the coast near the kingdom of vera it is normally beneath the waves but the water is low this year revealing the sunken remains of the temple of the old gods that was erected there
1770220 the third point is here in leonia if the horde takes leonia then they will have access to all of the points if this happens than they will release their fallen into the world dark age like we have never seen will rise giving the entire world to evil
1770221 antede came to scout the castle and no doubt saw what level of unprepared chaos we are in gather the troops near the southern gate and have the metal sharpened and the longbows and crossbows restrung i will meet you there
1770222 he will utter nothing to anyone now that he is dead
1770223 the horde has a collective conscious a greater evil that controls it it is said that the greater evil resides in the underworld and that the horde is merely his pawns to do with as he wishes
1770224 what one demon sees they all see that is why they are so difficult to defeat they know your fighting style and your tricks before they even meet you if you have ever fought one before
1770225 how do you know if you have can they all look like a human as antede did
1770226 they can all change into any shape they wish but they shape must coincide with their size a demon that stands six foot cannot change into a dog or a mouse but can easily change into a small horse or a human just as a demon that is the size of a child cannot change into a cow or and adult human do you understand
1770227 i can tell them apart though i can see them and i can smell them the power of the slayer allows me to detect the demons even in their shifted forms not to mention the fact that all of them smell like a rotten heap of flesh they smell like death you will see when they come for leonia and they are coming soon
1770228 what news is so important that you interrupt my meeting
1770229 it is not very often i can escape from my royal duties to attend to other affairs
1770230 you will have nothing including your head if you do not tell me how vandettos ring ended up in the hands of a demon you know the prophecy as well as i millcor if the horde takes this castle then the world is finished
1770231 vandetto left under the cover of night over three months ago no one including me has seen him since
1770232 all will be lost your kingdom will be nothing your money and your gold will be nothing do you understand millcor vandetto understood the importance of this land he was a great king far from what you will become the demon spoke of you as though you were scum they only speak of men that way if they are requested to otherwise they speak of them as though we were nothing that is what the horde thinks of man they think we are nothing i dont like the idea of you and the horde making any kind of deal for this kingdom if i find that you had anything to do with your brothers death then you will be found hanging from the rafters of your bedchambers with your precious gold beside you
1770233 i suggest you quit melting down the armory weapons to make this worthless coin
1770234 the people want to know where their gold and silver is going they will overthrow you when they find out i suggest you send your chambermaids away and decide how to cure the money problems you are causing if i were you i would start by hiring fewer guards they seem to be fairly useless anyway
1770235 is that what you came here to say to me today
1770236 the demon from the square came with a message for leonia
1770237 the swords in the armory are useless rusted and dull what should we do
1770238 bring them to the royal blacksmith have him repair them
1770239 the royal blacksmith is gone no one can find him nor his apprentices i know the peasant blacksmiths would not accept millcors coin in the past and that is all any of the soldiers have
1770240 the soldiers of leonia need these swords hammered and sharpened before nightfall
1770241 these coins of the keepers would feed my family for over a year lord samisin
1770242 when the slayers were the guardians of the lands we were respected and needed with the honor of being a slayer comes the responsibility of protecting a planet from the forces of the horde forever there has been a struggle between good and evil with both sides equally balanced the slayers became too much for the horde to handle we destroyed them for the most part chased them from one corner of the planet to the other from one pole to the next we hunted them and slaughtered them like the beasts they are slayers began to die out then most quit became family men your grandfather was a slayer alezandria one of the best men i have ever met the spirit of the slayer is what makes us warriors it is what makes us fight for what we believe in i remember when you first came to me to become a slayer you had heard the tales of adventure and you were so excited i taught you what i knew but i never taught you what the slayers knew that comes from inside for many millennia there have been slayers and for many millennia there have been slayers who have died never will there be two slayers in the same lands at once it is too difficult to contain the balance of power slayers are unique never quite the same but they all fight for one thing peace and harmony
1770243 it sounds silly but that can be the only way magic is no more and the horde is unaffected by little else besides weapons of war and destruction
1770244 i came to leonia because it called me since then i have never had to decide what i would do i just always did it two days after arriving in leonia i met antede in his demon form of course he clawed out my eye before he escaped i knew i would find him one day and pay him back
1770245 the last of the keepers was a dragon named raglan in her last day of life she called me to her when i arrived she gave me her gift her eye allows me to see the horde wherever it hides even in the form of a human like antede in the square today and then she gave me the history of the slayers with the engravings on my blade
1770246 your sword i thought those were your battles etched into that blade
1770247 every slayers battles are on this cold steel in it
1770248 that means you alezandria youre the best shot ive got around here
1770249 dark spells to hide their numbers well discover how many there are soon enough until then we wait
1770250 the last follower of a useless religion how does it feel to know you died in a battle against those you are sworn to defeat pathetic
1770251 die millcor and rot in the underworld with your demon kin die
1770252 i did read the book of the slayer just as you told me ive done everything you instructed the soldiers to do ever since i joined their ranks i have always done everything you have ever told me to do i want to be you samisin i want to be a slayer i dont know how to exist without your guidance without you
1770253 we need you out there i need you out there
1770254 i have been replaced there cannot be two slayers in the same part of the world one slayer is all a realm can hold for their powers are too great
1770255 who is the other slayer does he know hes the slayer will he stop them before it is too late
1770256 you will have to look inside for that answer child
1770257 i am the keeper raglan i was samisins keeper the bond between keeper and slayer is so strong that one is sometimes lost without the other samisin was strong though he survived when others could not until he had left the spirit of the slayer with another for there to be another slayer means something else as well somewhere there is another keeper it will be a dragon too but the last of the dragons you will have to find this keeper you are now the last of the slayers alezandria be sure to use your powers well i once gave samisin the gift of true sight
1770258 as i will now give you something use it wisely use it as samisin would have
1770259 it is what made me realize i was finally a slayer
1770260 it will guide you as it guided me be glad that you have not the pain i did when i received it though and that you have the mark without losing the sight when you finally come here there will be a place for you right next to me
1770261 i love you alezandria as though you were my own child i will be with you forever go now
1770262 its good for a sportsman to be recognized for his performances but i have to say that the titles won last year by the team are far more important
1770263 the situation is positive for both players we believe tomas could be available in september and eduardo maybe in november
1770264 i thought both sides came out full of confidence and it was a tough battle for the first five minutes unfortunately we lost that battle and the two early goals made things much more difficult for us were disappointed to lose but well be working hard to get back on track against japan
1770265 i like to listen to songs with different energy some are up tempo some are feel good songs and some just classics i grew up with i could probably have a legit top 100 to list these are what i would listen to for getting pumped up in no particular order
1770266 the event of the transfiguration marks a decisive moment in the ministry of jesus
1770267 sometimes its actually good because you get to test out some of these young receivers its good to get these guys some extra reps so they can have a better grip on the offense the games and practices tell us a lot about some of these young guys who can help this team who can be the fourth or fifth wide receiver it shouldnt change your reads youre still going with reads that the defense is telling you hopefully some of these guys start making some plays and develop a better understanding of when and how to get open
1770268 a template for the better world we have been so urgently seeking

1770278 i am honored to accept this award on behalf of the asia pacific network for sex workers
1770279 international recognition of sex workers human rights is vital to curb the hiv pandemic governments and un agencies need to promote sustainable comprehensive hiv prevention and care initiatives for sex workers that are community led and protect their human rights

1770281 the international aids conference presents a forum to focus worldwide attention on the epidemic and our global response
1770282 unfortunately too often that response has been tainted by prejudice and misinformation only by ensuring the health and human rights of sex workers will governments un agencies donors and nongovernmental groups be effective at reducing the vulnerability of sex workers to hiv infection the asia pacific networks work epitomizes this
1770283 the wages should be hiked in view of the inflation the reason behind the industry surviving over such minor issues is that there is no uniformity in the wages of the diamond workers the diamond cutting and polishing rates differ from company to company with some paying rs 15 and some rs 25 per diamond one us dollar is equivalent to 42 50 rupees if the wages are fixed then the issue will automatically subside the ongoing agitation has definitely affected the trading business

1770285 in recent years certain open source software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our license based software model
1770286 the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsofts own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products
1770287 microsoft released the sharepoint protocol as part of its compliance with the european commissions decision issued on march 24 2004
1770288 the popularization of the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including continuing efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products

1770304 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1770305 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1770306 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush

1770326 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
1770327 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
1770328 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
1770329 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
1770330 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
1770331 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
1770332 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
1770333 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
1770334 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form

1770352 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1770353 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1770354 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
1770355 you ought to welcome people being able to express their minds
1770356 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1770357 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow
1770358 i dont know whether or not theyre going to give up their weapons

1770383 oh hey the real world is too painful to deal with
1770384 mighty strange my teachers allus learnt me that the past inconquerable tense had a lil more body to it
1770385 course what he ought to holler is octopotmus is got me
1770386 thatd be more the past invokable tense only for use gainst elephants an other dry type game
1770387 then in that case hed of hollered elephumps did got me
1770388 id use the present indictible tense more like this rhinockwursts done is got me
1770389 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
1770390 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
1770391 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
1770392 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
1770393 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
1770394 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
1770395 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
1770396 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
1770397 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
1770398 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
1770399 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
1770400 im not a hypocrite i dont see things as right left i see things as right wrong so just because the people at fox like the sean hannitys of the world dont want to accept that theres climate problems theres enough information out there that im concerned
1770401 so al gore says were going to put a set of commercials together where two enemies get together on one cause and say lets support this so theyre going to get donald trump and rosie odonnell to do one and me and my arch enemy to do one
1770402 i gave them two dates because i was doing the movie and i was doing my family vacation and then i had to get the sound track ready for the movie get my album ready the 35 hits do a ford truck commercial and start rehearsing for the tour
1770403 just one of those unfortunate things it could still happen
1770404 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
1770405 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
1770406 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
1770407 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
1770408 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
1770409 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
1770410 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
1770411 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
1770412 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
1770413 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
1770414 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
1770415 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
1770416 if everything is so good for barack obama why isnt everything so good for barack obama
1770417 whats remarkable this summer is the stability of this race
1770418 in a broad sense it is similar to previous elections
1770419 despite previous studies suggesting a warmer climate is already taking a bite out of washingtons snowpack theres no clear evidence that human induced climate change has caused a drop in 20th century snow levels according to a new study by university of washington scientists

1770476 anderson did not stop or seize any of the messages that were forwarded to him
1770477 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act
1770478 the information was obtained in a legal manner from a confidential informant who we believe obtained the information legally
1770479 the case is alarming because its implications will reach far beyond a single civil case
1770480 law enforcement officers could engage in the contemporaneous acquisition of e mails just as anderson did without having to comply with the wiretap acts requirements
1770481 internet service providers could intercept and use the private communications of their customers with no concern about liability
1770482 the government could go to your internet service provider and say copy all of your e mail but make the copy a millisecond after the email arrives and it would not be a wiretap

1770502 if outsourcers take on the carbon footprint of their customers we are presented with an interesting conundrum as a company
1770503 our carbon footprint will always grow as we grow as we take on the it operations of more customers so we add the carbon contribution of those operations to our own however because we run things more efficiently the rise in our footprint should be less than the fall in theirs and overall emissions therefore reduced
1770504 our approach leads to immediate and continuous reduction in environmental impact of an organisations it estate
1770505 our outsourcing services combine our lean thinking to drive continuous improvement and with the benefits of scale and the latest technologies we can make a significant reduction in overall carbon footprint

1770587 the installation of fujitsu recycling equipment has allowed bes to reinforce the politics of cash recirculation and compliance with the present guidelines regarding the certification of bank notes the platform of remote equipment monitoring creates additional value for bes because it is an innovative solution and a basic asset for the efficient management of such equipment
1770588 this project is very important to fujitsu which already has a 20 year old history in the introduction of new technologies in the top portuguese financial institutions this solution of cash management represented an additional challenge because it involved the local development of monitoring and resource agility tools that will be exported now to spain and italy
1770589 unless there is a radical transformation of existing business processes well in advance of any collaborative programme then a project is doomed to failure before it has even started collaboration introduces an entirely new way of working and this has a direct impact on the way people work how they interact with it and how they are trained businesses need to understand all these facets before undertaking a project of this nature user buy in is an absolute pre requisite to success
1770590 it policies also need to be reviewed this must encompass issues such as the appropriate use of email and instant messaging technologies as well as ensuring that the organisation has the capability to archive and monitor all communications
1770591 collaborative solutions should in fact eradicate the need for this sort of communications technology as everything can be captured on the collaboration platform which in turn will support many aups
1770592 collaborative solutions enable individuals and groups to interact in real time and keep a record of whatever they discuss and agree to do increased levels of communication and co operation between your employees partners and customers drives any organisation towards an anytime anywhere culture that delivers tangible business benefits
1770593 start with one technology area and then expand to others alternatively start with one business process and then add in others applying the collaborative technology as and when you assess the success of the initial projects the third option is to start with one business unit or group before large scale roll out
1770594 critical to this however is user acceptance and that will mean the radical transformation of traditional mindsets in a number of business areas not least human resources and the way employees interact the answer be prepared
1770595 weve started with what the mass market knows and understands scheduled tv and were introducing new consumption models woven into that familiar experience

1770601 the island has proved to be a great success with hundreds of visitors looking at the memorials to ordinary people the military personnel lost in the gulf and afghanistan and celebrities alike the staging of tribute concerts is a natural progression but letting the artists celebrate their heroes the people whove inspired them is a great way of keeping the island alive and interactive something thats a big part of the ethos behind second life

1770603 thats why we think were probably only using 30 or 40 per cent of the power of the ps3 right now and theres this great untapped potential all third party developers can get the edge libraries for free and are going to be able to use them in their own ways to get more and more and more out of the ps3 over the years
1770604 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out
1770605 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
1770606 but for me i just kind of thought that wed never manage it never quite make it but the feelings not too bad really its what its like as a games developer you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype ive had what four or five things that never happened its funny that we dont even talk about them a lot of the time because you think well we might revisit it
1770607 the balls not in anybody at rares court really its squarely in the license holders courts its a shame its kind of locked in this no mans land theres nothing on live arcade theres nothing on wii
1770608 its just what happens legally sometimes not necessarily with games but you see it with music and films things get locked in this legal limbo even most of the parties involved probably all the parties involved want to solve it its such a complex issue
1770609 im the best marketer in the world of course i knew this
1770610 if you view it as something you have to have its never going to happen
1770611 youll be thinking about it too much if after one orgasm youre totally spent and satisfied you shouldnt even try for more
1770612 but the instant you do the tension will plummet and it will be extremely difficult to build it back up again
1770613 instead of stopping completely after your first orgasm just slow down a bit so the tension stays at a high level
1770614 then gradually increase the speed and intensity of stimulation until it starts to feel really really good again your body will guide you
1770615 thats the best way to learn because during masturbation you have total control
1770616 if your partners present hell be having his own thing going on and that might distract you
1770617 the number of orgasms a woman can have is unlimited
1770618 ive heard of women whove had more than 20 in one sex session
1770619 we have exercise in a pill with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it
1770620 despite the internet buzz the scientists admitted these results were not an intentional result of their work
1770621 whats more they dont have the science down pat they know it works in mice thats it
1770622 aicar activates certain proteins that switch on sets of genes needed for endurance but it doesnt replace exercise
1770623 so people who have difficulty exercising because of a medical condition could benefit from this drug
1770624 its also possible that aicar protects a person from gaining weight on a high fat diet which could help treat obesity
1770625 but we are so far away from developing a drug that replaces exercise and all its benefits if ever
1770626 just like eating mood and sexual habits your exercise habits are largely factored by nature and nurture
1770627 sure its true certain people have a propensity to excel in different fields however its possible to overcome some genetic predispositions with behavior modification
1770628 again this study has only been done on mice so the effects on humans are unknown
1770629 however since we can modify our genetics with behavior dont use this study as an excuse to not exercise
1770630 for we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been freed from sin
1770631 maybe where youre from all the children play walk through the walls i never learned it

1770756 as i perform the songs i had the time and focus to really think about what i was thinking about when i wrote that song
1770757 i put off listening to the album for a long time
1770758 the first time i tried to listen to it i couldnt even make it all the way through it it was kind of boring to me but after a few listens it grew on me

1770763 and i miss a lot of them we only have so much room in the set i loved the idea because it kind of satisfied my need to get all those songs out again

1770766 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
1770767 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
1770768 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
1770769 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
1770770 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
1770771 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
1770772 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
1770773 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
1770774 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again

1770776 with 25 years of experience as a military lawyer i have a great deal of confidence in military judges juries prosecutors and defense attorneys to fairly and appropriately deal with allegations of war crimes by unlawful enemy combatants
1770777 as one of the primary authors of the military commissions act mca i continue to believe the military commission setting is the right venue for these trials not civilian courts
1770778 i was pleased the commission proceedings were open to the public to the maximum extent possible and the judge prohibited the use of evidence he found to be a result of coercive interrogations
1770779 i love his policies and his passion hes an example to my sons to not be afraid be willing to take a risk and to do it with respect for god and people
1770780 i want to be held accountable if i am fortunate enough if i have the honor to serve as your president then youre still going to have to watch out youve still got to make sure that im going to do what i said i was going to do because thats how our democracys supposed to work

1770791 cuba has granted leases in the gulf to communist china so china will be able to drill off the coast of florida bring the congress back to pass an energy bill for the american people
1770792 the speaker says she wont bring up a vote on drilling because she is trying to save the planet if nancy pelosi wanted to save the planet she would allow for more american energy exploration because american energy production is the cleanest in the world
1770793 we need a balanced energy plan that says we must conserve we must invest in alternatives and at the same time we need to bring more american oil and natural gas on line
1770794 i am the only member of congress from new england to vote against adjournment and yet new england has the highest heating costs of any where in the country i am not asking people to vote the way i want to vote but lets have a debate
1770795 we are the only country in the world with a moratorium on drilling but we cant drill our way out of high gas prices alone we must do other things too we must drill we must conserve and we must invest in alternative energy
1770796 we are here today because congress has gone home for five weeks we believe that the business of passing an energy bill is too important to wait until september
1770797 we can look at a map of the middle east and say thats a very interesting part of the world but its irrelevant to our economic security we can say we dont need them because we can do it here in america

1770821 the bush administrations disregard of faa workers rights has put the safety of our aviation system at risk the administrations heavy handed tactics have forced experienced air traffic controllers out the door in record numbers its time we treat these workers with the respect they deserve
1770822 by giving all faa employees fair labor rights we can recruit and retain the number of safety professionals our air travel system needs to run smoothly and safely
1770823 our aviation system is in disarray the faas unilateral imposition of work and pay rules has forced our veteran air traffic controllers into retiring earlier than they had planned depleting the human infrastructure that once made the u s aviation system the envy of the world the flying public is paying the price for the faas mismanagement with record breaking delays and we are concerned with the growing number of runway incursions and near mid air collisions happening in the system passage of this bill will provide the incentive for controllers to remain on the boards so that the safety of the flying public can be restored
1770824 our first responders small business owners and non profits in maryland and across the country are hurting because of high gas prices
1770825 today 62 of small business owners use a vehicle in their business and many are facing serious financial problems because of high gas prices at the same time we are seeing the effect of high gas prices on our first responders and we are experiencing a decline in services by the non profit community because they cannot afford the price of gas in the short term we need to provide immediate relief to americans in the long term we need new policies that will make us energy secure and end our nations dependence on foreign oil
1770826 americans are feeling stretched and strained as they face rising fuel costs and food prices i believe congress must act now to provide relief to the families and businesses who are struggling to make ends meet we need to put government back on the side of the people
1770827 i know that marylanders are frustrated and i take those frustrations with me to the capitol as i fight to go after the speculators and gas gougers who are manipulating our economy and for federal investments in alternative fuels that will bring costs down
1770828 mr mcculloughs research clearly shows that oil prices are no longer tied to supply and demand
1770829 statistically this research shows that prices are spiking absent of a crisis like a natural disaster or supply disruption however prices then fell when congress began serious debate on how to crack down on those who may be trying to manipulate the markets research shows that traders may well be in control of the market not supply and demand and consumers have been left paying the price
1770830 there is evidence of a troubling concentration of ownership in the oil markets
1770831 this allows a few players to have undue influence on setting prices however the regulators are driving blind through this crisis since they are collecting such little information that reveals who is doing what in the market

1770840 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1770841 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1770842 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1770843 this speech puts together what the president has been saying for seven and a half years but does it in a very focused way
1770844 is one of the most important relationships that we have in the united states and the speech is being given on the eve of his trip there so he thought it was appropriate to talk about it at this point
1770845 absurd to try to sustain the claim that americas policies are principled while then effectively standing back and saying we will watch from the sidelines while the chinese do what they do
1770846 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1770847 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
1770848 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1770849 thats a debate im happy to have because reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists
1770850 misusing of an arm of government the kind of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1770851 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter is absurd
1770852 ultimately habbush could not offer proof that weapons that didnt exist didnt exist
1770853 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1770854 i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter
1770855 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack

1770861 a clean reliable source of water is essential for the health and well being of mountainburg residents
1770862 in addition this investment will foster economic development and benefit the wider community
1770863 its important that we continue to improve infrastructures to provide citizens with a reliable and dependable quality of drinking water
1770864 i am pleased mountainburg officials have taken a proactive approach in making sure its residents get this basic need
1770865 they help confirm the rise of the bric economies as viable alternative places to invest taking funds primarily from the u s economy the continued strength of the european economies may come as a surprise to some but the fact that they hold up so well suggests that we may be developing a roughly equal balance of economic power between the americas europe and asia pacific that would indeed herald the start of an entirely new global economic game

1770869 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all of the stages that i have to become a u s citizen
1770870 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american seeing my fellow americans coming behind me in the opening ceremony and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor its just a happy day i dont even have the words to describe how happy i am
1770871 we looked at where we are and what we needed to be successful and it starts at the back end to have two quality goalies like this gives our young players the opportunity to make a few more mistakes and be more creative up top
1770872 ernies acknowledgement of the role that his staff has played in the programs success reached the point that he was willing to deflect substantial personal gain to aid the continued growth of the program
1770873 that speaks a lot not only for the commitment he has for his players and staff but also the university and this community
1770874 i am honored to have been the head basketball coach at the university of oregon for the last 11 years

1770876 credit related expenses were far higher than what guidance had been
1770877 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1770878 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate
1770879 we have to prepare for a stress condition that looks worse than that
1770880 i was totally not expecting the call for this team
1770881 i just came off a really good college season and got a call up in january got invited to one of the camps out in california and ended up performing pretty well and kept getting the call back the coaches were really really positive and really willing to invest in me and had a lot of faith in me so i was really thankful that they were willing to take a chance and give me the look for this team
1770882 this time around when i came in i knew the girls
1770883 i didnt have to re meet all the same girls so that was an easy transition for me my biggest goal this time around was to get good chemistry on the field so that when i play with them were playing together and looking good and playing as a team
1770884 i think her experience over the past couple of years at college has helped her grow a lot as a player
1770885 shes changed her style of game shes very strong very physical and i think thats one of the things were going to really need up front someone that can hold onto the ball but has the quickness and speed she has as well to take people on and get around them shes shown that over the past few games
1770886 she is just a hilarious person and i love being around because i cant stop laughing
1770887 i think us younger girls we kind of developed a bond here being a little bit younger and having played together on the youth teams so its cool to have that
1770888 my teammates are really supportive im getting a lot of phone calls and text messages from them
1770889 its nice to see that my team is behind me especially when i decided to take a semester off of school to go chase down a dream of my own its really nice to have my teammates back at home supporting me
1770890 its one thing to watch the olympics and root for your country and one thing to win and all but to actually know the person who is playing and to really have that relationship with that person is so cool and were so excited for her
1770891 initiative that all governments need to take forward to ensure that agricultural knowledge science and technology fulfils its potential to meet the development and sustainability goals of the reduction of hunger and poverty the improvement of rural livelihoods and human health and facilitating equitable socially environmentally and economically sustainable development

1770893 in evolutionary theory altruism means behavior that reduces the actors fitness while enhancing the fitness of others if the total contribution of the altruist to the fitness of others is greater than the fitness lost by the altruist altruism will increase the prospects of the groups surviving in competition with other groups

1770927 hes a smart player and makes good decisions if he sees he has run out of room and space you know hes going to be chipping it in or driving wide with it if he has room hell go in without the puck and hell finish his checks and hes on the puck all the time

1770953 when you first mention it to artists a lot of them their initial reaction is whats wrong with our new stuff
1770954 much stronger and faster than humans but they had no endurance
1770955 the australopiths would really excel at gymnastics and diving because of the greater upper body strength longer arms
1770956 their short stature and low body mass would also have greatly increased their ability to do flips and spins because of the low rotational inertia of their body
1770957 australopithecus represented a biped on the ground with much more climbing ability and without striding locomotion
1770958 running would have been possible but probably not as efficient
1770959 most human sports that we value the most with exception of power sports involve this incredible ability to run or do aerobic capacity
1770960 however if you compared them to early modern humans the neanderthals and early humans would not appear very different
1770961 neanderthals were somewhat shorter and stockier than the average sapiens but there are modern humans with the same proportions

1770993 although her career path may be different from many of our students
1770994 kates commitment to her education is the same she is one of over 345 000 current students who know university of phoenix plays an important role in higher education today offering nontraditional working students like kate a quality alternative that is more accessible than conventional four year colleges and universities
1770995 i am looking forward to my first headlining tour with myspace and university of phoenix

1771019 why cant the computer take the one thing that i want to do and split it into pieces so that each core can do part of the work
1771020 he hasnt been on our radar because hes been a contracted player
1771021 all i can say is that if that changes well discuss it
1771022 there will be much speculation for the next two months
1771023 we have not discussed any of the collingwood players who may become available id need to talk to my chairman and the board
1771024 we had our market value and they had theirs so we started negotiations a little way apart
1771025 but im confident it will be resolved at some stage soon were just trying to finalise it i wouldnt say it was in a stalemate weve just been working through it
1771026 elbows were raised i dont know if they were trying to make us injured for the olympic games
1771027 yeah it was definitely one of the most physical games ive ever played in
1771028 i think it was important for us to give them the message that we wont back down no matter how physical they want to play
1771029 last time at the world championships they didnt get to the gold medal match and i think maybe that mightve been on their minds
1771030 none of us backed down but i was just hoping that none of us got hurt for the olympic games thats how physical it was
1771031 they were just trying to say theyre hungry for it but i just think were hungrier and were better than them
1771032 we have a lot more to give than we did last night
1771033 i cant wait for the gold medal game because we want that gold medal really bad
1771034 i dont think we played anywhere near as good as we can and we only lost by four points
1771035 i think tonight the judiciary and the system has said to players out there that its ok to assault the referee by grabbing his jumper as paul gallen did its ok to abuse a referee like michael crocker did but you cant make a non verbal non abusive non aggressive gesture
1771036 lets just tell the kids out there that its ok to grab a referee and pull him lets tell the kids its ok to run aggressively at a referee and swear at him and attack him verbally
1771037 but dont you keep your mouth shut and make a childish action in frustration kids dont do that because youll get in trouble
1771038 if someone did it to me i wouldnt think anything of it ive used it a few times at the racetrack when ive been trying to get home a horse and the chips have been down
1771039 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1771040 i just laughed i said seriously youre joking and then he has a go at anthony youre kidding yourself if youre taking advice off him
1771041 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1771042 in light of what has happened my advice about sonny not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1771043 im not speaking on behalf of the club in this area but people who have known folkesy for the last 30 years would find that extremely hard to believe
1771044 to slur folkesy like that is where this whole situation has got to and thats pretty sad
1771045 the whole things totally distorted and if people want to go down that route i feel sorry for them because theyre trying to steer people away from the real facts of the matter
1771046 the bulldogs as a club are one of the most multicultural football clubs in the nrl
1771047 if sonny bill williams is alleging that racism is a root cause of his decision to walk out then the young man has been badly advised
1771048 i think sonny might be thinking he hasnt got that much longer to go and he needs to get out of it what he can
1771049 looking at it that way i can see his point of view but i think the way he went about it and not letting us know wasnt the right way to go about it
1771050 youd have to say its harder to win when hes in the field than when hes not in the field but i dont see this as any greater opportunity than last years pga
1771051 if the pins are on top of all these hills it could be borderline impossible to shoot anywhere near par but if you have pins down the bottom of the slopes and the tees up it will be a bit more playable
1771052 this is an interesting course to attack because the birdie holes change each day based on the pin placements
1771053 i would like to have my world record back because i did it clean and you dont like to be pointing the finger at anybody without any substantive information but at the end of the day i probably dont think it was done cleanly
1771054 i would be silly not to question the world record denis hasnt been caught yet but obviously you have to be a bit suspicious
1771055 they are all from the same squad they all train together
1771056 i agree that it is a case of systematic doping i find it frustrating that such planned cheating is still going on i am very disappointed
1771057 the fact so many positive tests have come out in the past week shows it is only the tip of the iceberg
1771058 we have known for a long time that systematic doping has been going on in russia because they dont have an anti doping agency and it is difficult for international testers to get in there with the visa system the testing just hasnt happened
1771059 the fact there are a few more tests going on now by the international federation and the athletes are getting caught is a great thing
1771060 as a whole russian athletics has got a lot of work to do to clean up their act
1771061 this year there have been two coaching changes appendix surgery and two hamstring tears and fighting with athletics australia isnt really the best preparation for the olympics
1771062 i dont blame anyone but myself because im the one doing it all i can do is learn from it and then move on
1771063 im 25 ive still got a lot of years in track so were not saying this is it for john steffensen
1771064 its something you dont want to throw away its a good opportunity and you cant slap fate or destiny in the face
1771065 im here for a reason i made this decision for a reason and i think it would be wrong for me to throw it away just because im not running well individually
1771066 but this is the way it is and i think something good is going to come out of this for me
1771067 im not in bad shape in terms of fitness wise to be able to get around
1771068 but as far as mentally when you get hurt its a big strain on you in two weeks i can get myself together mentally for the relay heats on august 22
1771069 dont stand too close to each other or you wont have room to wave your flags
1771070 i havent said anything about breaking any records or going after any records my goals havent been published bob his coach bob bowman and i are the only ones who know them and were going to work through the next week and a half and try to accomplish our goals
1771071 at the olympic games you have to be ready to swim no matter when morning night noon or midnight it doesnt matter to me i will swim whenever i have to
1771072 each one of us has our own goals and michael doing what hes doing doesnt affect that
1771073 but if the guys going to win eight gold medals well three would normally be very very good but i dont have a problem taking a back seat to anyone who wins eight because he deserves it
1771074 its never become a chore i love training i love playing that hasnt wavered
1771075 when tagging midfielders get that much protection now but he ran them to death when they used to hang on and whack you and really target you physically
1771076 he never took his eye off the ball and he just continued to run them into the ground
1771077 im not a great overly long kick or a good mark and im not a goal kicker as such if you want to be an afl player for a long time youve got to hang your hat on something and thats all ive been able to hang my hat on being able to push myself
1771078 im still pretty quiet now but i was really quiet then and i used to saunter up to him after training and correct him but sure enough hed call me rodney again
1771079 it took him about six months to clear it up

1771380 no le vemos ning n beneficio a la participaci n de empresas privadas en la gesti n de aeropuertos

1771395 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
1771396 misusing of an arm of government the kind of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1771397 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter is absurd
1771398 ultimately habbush could not offer proof that weapons that didnt exist didnt exist
1771399 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1771400 i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter
1771401 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1771402 the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1771409 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
1771410 threw all of his opponents off the ballot on a technicality so that the voters had no choice but to elect him
1771411 audacity of hope his second book you see that he talks about that election as if he had gone around chicagos south side telling people be less cynical about politics and then they liked his speech and elected him
1771412 it said that 9 11 ring leader mohamed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq
1771413 the notion that the white house would concoct such a letter is absurd
1771414 when that information was passed to president bush he said f it were going in
1771415 i hope this brings you the closure that you seek
1771416 he said that we hit him but honestly nothing happened
1771417 if we really hit him the cops wouldve come they just let us go right away
1771418 the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1771419 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1771420 a welcome reversal politics are intrinsically involved in the olympics to buy into the notion that this is just a sporting event is just silly beijing was awarded the olympics as a political gesture
1771421 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1771422 and we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1771423 my hope is that the axis of evil list no longer exists thats my hope for the sake of peace and its my hope for the sake of our children

1771429 i was literally in my car and thought paris must respond its her duty as a citizen
1771430 within three hours i was on the phone with her and she was into it
1771431 mccain made one huge mistake he drifted into the world of pop culture and thats paris world she owns that world

1771434 i really feel blessed to do what i do to represent the people of the state of minnesota in the united states senate
1771435 ill talk about whats the path for dealing with that ill recognize weve made some mistakes we talked about being the party of fiscal responsibility but thats not what people saw coming out of washington
1771436 we made some mistakes in iraq in terms of the process of war we were so concerned about the label of war for oil that we havent held the iraqis accountable enough for paying for their own reconstruction
1771437 but ill also say that the path on the other side of raising taxes of cutting off trade of not supporting any kind of increased production of oil thats not a path to a brighter future we are still the party of hope and of opportunity
1771438 someone who usually goes along with what president bush wants
1771439 ive always been an independent voice and i take pride in that i try to do what i think is best for the people i represent bringing the experience and judgment to the table thats based on being in iraq many times listening to the people there
1771440 whether im in the senate or anyone else is in the senate the pace of withdrawal is mostly going to depend on what we hear from commanders on the ground the goal which i think civilian leadership can articulate is to move us out as safely and quickly as possible but that end is not something thats motivated by an election date but by whats the right thing to do
1771441 maybe we need to reopen the door on nuclear energy
1771442 gov pawlenty believes expanding nuclear energy production is one part of a comprehensive energy solution for our country minnesota should be open to this option although leading utilities in minnesota have no plans to build additional nuclear plants in the near and intermediate term
1771443 are now more open to nuclear energy particularly if we can reprocess the waste the way france is doing
1771444 we cant have more nuclear power in this country unless government were going to intervene aggressively
1771445 its a remarkable technology for a conservative republican to support

1771451 money and good intentions are not enough or why a liberal democrat thinks states need both competition and community

1771454 more than a whole generation of poor kids have been lost
1771455 im struck at how horrified we are of his voucher idea struck to the point of wondering whether there isnt a certain bigotry behind it that may be too strong a word but it shows how strongly i feel about this weve got to be trying things different from what weve been trying for those kids
1771456 its always puzzled me that more academics dont do that
1771457 id ask the people who are offended by this have you ever told a dirty joke or laughed at one
1771458 did you ever think that it might come back at you later in life
1771459 eight years ago al franken did not know he was going to run for the senate if youre going to judge him for what he wrote eight years ago then you need to look at yourself

1771463 were worried that in what should be a good year for the dfl we wont be able to win this senate seat
1771464 its his ability to get through this and move the campaign forward hes got to convince me
1771465 i think there will be more of these stories but theyll be less damaging because of what he said today i would never excuse what he said but i think we all have something in our background that makes us human beings that isnt entirely a match with our ideals
1771466 franken has a good heart a wellstone heart thats one a little bit bigger than most of us have
1771467 why do you suppose patricia anderson the former state auditor got herself on both the john mccain and the ron paul slates of national convention delegates
1771468 an advantage of campaigning from a position of responsibility for public safety is that you can illuminate the strategic investments that have long term benefits for the community
1771469 for example i can explain that its a good idea to spend resources to get kids back into the classroom because it will keep you from getting mugged today and make them more successful in the future
1771470 ill support the dfl endorsed ticket from top to bottom

1771488 mientras haya una situaci n de conflicto latente como la que se ha mostrado hasta ahora va a ser muy dif cil que todos estos procesos de integraci n energ tica infraestructura corredores bioce nicos puedan formalizarse
1771489 todos estos procesos necesarios y que incluso son relevantes e importantes para bolivia van marchando a un paso mucho m s lento o simplemente no avanzan justamente por el grado de incertidumbre que tiene el proceso boliviano

1771541 doctrine is not an affair of the tongue but of the life is not apprehended by the intellect and memory merely like other branches of learning but is received only when it possesses the whole soul and finds its seat and habitation in the inmost recesses of the heart but it must be transfused into the breast and pass into the conduct and so transform us into itself as not to prove unfruitful

1771594 all this talk of a need for patent deform is but a red herring fabricated by a handful of large tech firms as a diversion away from the real issue that they have no valid defense against charges they are using other parties technologies without permission
1771595 its not about reforming the system its about legalizing theft
1771596 not to fix the patent system but to destroy it or pervert it so only they may obtain and defend patents to make it a sport of kings

1771620 we are committed to improving our financial results and believe these proactive steps are necessary to manage through the current challenging environment
1771621 we remain very bullish on our growth prospects as the market for natural and organic products continues to grow and our company continues to evolve
1771622 however the challenging economic environment appears to be negatively impacting our sales
1771623 were half as big as we were two years ago
1771624 weve started restructuring our corporate support staff to meet the needs of our more tightly focused company
1771625 as we move forward we will continue to pursue other opportunities to streamline the organization
1771626 the economy has accelerated the pace at which weve made changes
1771627 the traditionally strong second quarter spring selling season never materialized reduced demand and lower consumer confidence has led to increasing excess inventory of new and existing homes which now approaches 11 months

1771629 well do what we can to assure that weyerhaeuser is here for the long haul
1771630 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days mccain and im not promising change like that other guy obama im just hot
1771631 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1771632 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1771633 and now i want to present my energy policy for america just after i finish reading this article on where i can fly to to get the best tan oh maui
1771634 barack wants to focus on new technology to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling
1771635 well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars
1771636 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which would then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved
1771637 mccain made significant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1771638 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1771639 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping
1771640 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1771641 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1771642 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1771643 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1771644 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1771645 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1771646 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack
1771647 chrysler has always been known as a lean and resourceful company
1771648 they will be pressed here but they can emerge as a fundamentally sound company if they can get past this mass hysteria
1771649 before someone comes to us they need to sit down and answer these questions how much money do i really need
1771650 thats when i like to remind them of the spanish saying that in the bullfight its easier to see whats going on when youre sitting in the stands than when youre standing in front of the bull
1771651 know why you want the money and what youll do with it
1771652 thats not helpful we need more detail such as unit numbers and customers from the bottom up
1771653 it all helps us to know who were dealing with
1771654 its part of our job to translate energy and enthusiasm into the language of finance in order to create a business plan that makes sense and is an accurate reflection of the managements vision for the future
1771655 im looking for a track record in a company of relevant size
1771656 with limited resources and the high level of uncertainty that small businesses have
1771657 we dont invest in companies we invest in people we look for a track record in the relevant industry integrity and experience we need to be comfortable with the individual
1771658 th e best situation is when everyone agrees on an investment horizon of say three to five years when everyone knows when they want to get out thats a big step
1771659 is it just money or is it also experienced people to act as board members and advisors
1771660 when they come into the webcast or virtual show we know who they are how long they stayed how many questions they asked and what they did
1771661 we provide them a list heres the leads heres what they did they downloaded a white paper they went to conference session
1771662 so that you can say heres the top leads that should go to direct sales heres the leads that should go to inside sales heres the ones for marketing because they need to be nurtured further
1771663 it has really gained in popularity over the last year
1771664 its not like theyre going in huge droves but theyre becoming more comfortable with using online ways to get information
1771665 you want to create a sense of urgency youll have these keynotes with important people that drive a lot of audience to these events
1771666 i can talk to a student from columbia ask him questions find out how easy the courses are
1771667 the key is they allow a new kind of interaction to occur interactions that cant happen in a physical environment and not every attendee or advertiser can afford to go to vegas

1771669 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1771670 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1771671 i didnt know that barack obama had stooped to dishonesty
1771672 was an utter failure resulting in less domestic production and limiting supply
1771673 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1771674 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
1771675 we needed role players we needed shooters we needed people who would accept roles
1771676 its definitely a team sport almost more so than basketball because if youre in a team boat even if youre rowing with just one other person you have to work 100 percent with that person
1771677 prime example of the entrepreneurial dream that comes to reality with determination vision and passion
1771678 as of december 31 2007 the iraqi government had accumulated financial deposits of 29 4 billion held in the development fund for iraq and central government deposits at the central bank of iraq and iraqs commercial banks
1771679 this balance is the result in part of an estimated cumulative budget surplus of about 29 billion from 2005 to 2007 for 2008 gao estimates a budget surplus of between 38 2 billion to 50 3 billion

1771686 academic performance by students who had achieved modest gmat scores in the range of 600 out of 800 possible points was found to be on a par with that of fellow students whose gmat scores came in at a very good 740 points and vice versa
1771687 for overall academic success however other traits also play a major role for example leadership ability strategic thinking marketing and communication skills creativity and persuasiveness none of which are assessed by the gmat

1771695 hey everyone just thought i would catch up with you all from here in china as we prepare for the start of the olympics what a crazy past few weeks it has been for me as im sure most of you know i was sitting at dinner with some friends when i got the call a couple weeks ago that i would joining up with the olympic team in san jose i was obviously sad for nathan sturgis who got injured as he is a good friend of mine but ultimately i was thrilled to be going i arrived in san jose the next day after a 6am flight and immediately met up with the team before we departed for china that was a crazy day because we were issued all the gear we would be receiving for the games let me tell you i have never been given as much gear as i was in that day two big full duffle bags full of shirts shorts warm ups jackets hats socks shoes a suit and a cell phone the next morning we were off to hong kong to compete in the ing cup against the ivory coast and cameroon hong kong is truly an unbelievable place it has just as many if not more huge buildings and apartment complexes with a few skyscrapers thrown in there than new york city we stayed in a 5 star hotel that was right on the water hong kong bay i think and were treated very nicely the weather out here is extremely hot and humid i wont say it is as hot as dallas its close but the humidity is what really gets to you after a few days of training we played the two friendlies in hong kongs national stadium we ended up tying ivory coast 0 0 and losing to cameroon 1 0 not the results we wanted but ultimately these games are just warm ups to prepare us for the real thing we did not play our best but you can tell that the team is starting to come together and play some good soccer we will definitely be ready for that first game against japan we left hong kong after our last game and arrived in tianjin the site of our first 2 games in these olympics with tons of excitement we are staying in another first class hotel the security here is crazy just to get into the hotel our whole team had to go through metal detectors and put our bags through x ray machines the only others staying in the hotel with us are the 3 other teams in our group japan holland and nigeria and one of the groups from the womens side canadas group no one else is allowed to come to the hotel unless they have an olympic credential to get in not even families are allowed to come in pretty crazy stuff our first game is tomorrow against japan and everyone is very excited that the games are finally about to start i am very happy to be here and just trying to soak up the whole experience because this is definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity i have been following the guys back in dallas very closely and am thrilled to see us playing so well right now i knew it was only a matter of time before we started playing how we are capable of i cant wait to get back to dallas and start playing with the guys again but i need to bring back a gold medal first

1771698 its indispensable that this agency be in good hands in the hands of a capable honest person with a profound dedication to service to the country
1771699 falling vehicle prices and the negative equity it is creating continues to pressure sales trends

1771703 the kind of movies i watch are definitely guys movies this is departed this is fear this is all those characters times 10
1771704 i did one other cameo in the entourage pilot but i didnt get to do a scene with jeremy piven
1771705 this time its me and piven going at it so it was fun
1771706 people automatically assumed that i was going to really make that movie
1771707 my agent was even crazy enough to try to get jim cameron to direct it
1771708 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1771709 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
1771710 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
1771711 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
1771712 wal mart has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
1771713 i just dont have the disposable income i had last year

1771864 the movie is a chaotic mess but munchies in hand go with it
1771865 this is the kind of film that relies on its audience to find four letter words funny
1771866 parts of it are really funny although im sure it would be funnier if i had been stoned rather than periodically bored

1771896 photorealistic is what live action movies are animation is an art its like and i uh this is an art philosophical discussion you either like photorealistic art that looks exactly like a photograph or you like something that actually tries to find the truth behind the realism to me animation is an art its all about design its all about style its not about making it look photo real photo real ive been making photo real movies all my life and they have a lot of animation in them but theyre still photo real thats not what animation is animation is something else entirely its a completely different medium
1771897 art is a technological medium all art is so a lot of it has to do with engineering and trying to figure out how to create what you imagine its also a medium that is dictated primarily by the amount of resources you have available to you if youre pharaoh you can build pyramids if youre a shaman you really only have a few pieces of chalk and the wall of a cave and you have to work within that

1771902 it took five million hours of rendering time on shrek on monsters vs aliens it will take 40 million hours to render and a very large portion of that is 3d the demands are much much much more complicated with the rendering issues were faced with

1771929 kerajaan negeri memandang serius penangguhan projek pembesaran empangan mengkuang ini yang mana ianya merupakan salah satu projek yang diluluskan oleh dewan undangan negeri pulau pinang dan mengharapkan kerajaan persekutuan meneruskan projek ini ini adalah kerana semua penduduk pulau pinang adalah pembayar cukai dan empangan mengkuang ini terletak di kawasan parlimen permatang pauh maka kerana itu saya rasakan kerajaan pusat tidak bertanggungjawab kerana menangguhkannya
1771930 saya tegaskan bahawa ini adalah projek rakyat kerajaan menegaskan ianya mengutamakan projek bekalan makanan namun air adalah penting dalam kehidupan kita mungkin kita boleh berpuasa namun kita memerlukan air dari makanan jika keadaan darurat dan ini adalah keperluan asas dan kita merayu kerajaan pusat agar meneruskan dan jika tidak akan disiapkan kita akan menghadapi bekalan air yang tidak mencukupi dan empangan yang besar adalah untuk menyimpan air
1771931 pembesaran ini memberi impak yang besar kerana sewaktu berlakunya banjir diselatan kedah empangan mengkuang ini akan mengepam air yang berlebihan dan akan simpan didalam empangan mengkuang ini ini memberi keuntungan kerana air yang berlebihan di alirkan ke laut sistem pam ini dilakukan pada musim hujan dan kita akan meminimakan banjir di spu dan selatan kedah pulau pinang mengalami musim kemarau dari bulan januari ke bulan mei jadi jika ini berlaku simpanan air akan mencukupi untuk keperluan penduduk

1771938 this is a provision with astonishing reach and it was slipped into the bill just this week not only does it affect nearly every credit card transaction in america such as visa mastercard discover and american express but the bill specifically targets payment systems like ebays paypal amazon and google checkout that are used by many small online businesses the privacy implications for americas small businesses are breathtaking
1771939 privacy groups like the center for democracy and technology and small business organizations like the nfib sharply criticized this idea when it first appeared earlier this year
1771940 at a time when concerns about both identity theft and government spying are paramount congress wants to create a new honey pot of private data that includes social security numbers this bill reduces privacy across americas payment processing systems and treats every american small business or ebay power seller like a criminal on parole by requiring an unprecedented level of reporting to the federal government this outrageous idea is another reason to delay the housing bailout legislation so that senators and the public at large have time to examine its full implications

1772195 seorang pembaca bertanya apakah setelah membaca buku aku terima nikahnya dan memulakan perkahwinan dengan baik maka baiklah perkahwinan itu
1772196 permulaan yang baik bukanlah suatu jaminan ia hanya suatu permulaan

1772198 saya telah menghadiahkan anak saya sebaik baik hadiah buat mereka iaitu dengan saya mengahwini seorang perempuan sebaik dia
1772199 diperlihatkan kepadaku neraka sesungguhnya kebanyakan penghuninya adalah wanita mereka itu mengkufuri
1772200 mereka itu mengkufuri suami atau nikmat nikmat berumahtangga dan mereka mengkufuri ihsan apabila kamu melakukan kebaikan kepada salah seorang daripada mereka sepanjang tahun tetapi kemudiannya dia melihat sesuatu yang tidak kena padamu nescaya dia akan berkata kepada suaminya aku tidak nampak satu apa pun kebaikan padamu
1772201 marah itu adalah luahan rasa tidak puas hati dengan mengharapkan perubahan manakala benci pula adalah luahan rasa tidak puas hati tanpa mengharapkan perubahan putus asa dengan pasangan

1772208 we cannot and should not build a wall on the u s and mexico border
1772209 a fence or a wall at the border a 19th century solution to a 21st century problem cant people just go around it
1772210 he believes the best plan for securing the border is a multi layered approach that consists of enforcement workplace verification and interior enforcement
1772211 law enforcement would require an increase in personnel border patrol plus a variety of both high and low tech mechanisms including some fencing vehicle barriers sensors and surveillance technology
1772212 acquire vehicle barriers and necessary facilities to support its mission of achieving operational control of the borders

1772255 these plants may look good in your garden but many are pernicious and pose a real problem to the native vegetation and ecosystem
1772256 they can badly affect the ecology of our rivers and because many of them die down in winter they leave the banks bare and exposed to greater erosion
1772257 along with climate change invasive non indigenous plants are a major challenge to biodiversity
1772258 it doesnt just affect native plants but the fauna as well its all linked

1772263 people have a hard time adhering to diets and our research shows that choosing eggs for breakfast can dramatically improve the success of a weight loss plan
1772264 apparently the increased satiety and energy due to eggs helps people better comply with a reduced calorie diet
1772265 eggs are a good source of all natural high quality protein so they can help keep you satisfied longer making it easier to resist tempting snacks
1772266 nearly half of an eggs protein and many of the other nutrients are found in the yolk so make sure to eat the whole egg for maximum benefits

1772270 our duck billed dinosaur grew three to five times faster than any potential predators that lived alongside it
1772271 by the time the duck billed dinosaur was fully grown the tyrannosaurs were only half grown it was a huge size difference
1772272 thats another added bonus when facing predators if you can keep reproducing youre set
1772273 we were shocked at how fast they grew if you look at a cross section of the bone of a nestling or even from within the egg there are huge spaces in which blood supply was going through the bone which means they were growing like crazy
1772274 this study is a stepping stone to a larger comparative study on community changes that impacted dinosaur evolution

1772278 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1772279 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1772280 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1772281 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal

1772370 i am very conscious that any increase in fuel affects everyone right across society increasing both households and business costs my priority is to ensure that those who most need help with rising energy costs get that support from the government some 358 000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity and gas allowances through the household benefits package which help towards their heating light and cooking costs throughout the year this year we have increased the funding available to 145 million for electricity and 14 million for gas this represents additional expenditure on the household benefits package of 26 million in a full year
1772371 the increased rates of payment for energy costs for customers will ensure they continue to receive the same amount of energy under the household benefit scheme
1772372 i am working with my colleagues the minister for finance brian lenihan and minister for communications energy and natural resources eamon ryan to see how we can ensure the coordinated delivery of all fuel poverty initiatives across government departments and agencies

1772561 if europe beats us again then its time to say maybe they are beating us because they are just that much better they are great at team play and they seem to have some kind of chemistry that works really really well
1772562 i couldnt be happier it looks like there are at least six guys that are really secure to make this team
1772563 the four picks are going to be a little more difficult than i thought
1772564 if i just take the top eight guys that are not in the top eight right now go down to 16 there are a lot of really quality options there for me
1772565 any of those guys im happy with and theres none of those eight guys that know for sure they are going to be on this team

1772593 get off your high horses and accept what we have now got as a club our roots will always remain and we will never decline to the moral depths reached by our near neighbour
1772594 some fans do come to a moment when they wonder what the fuck is it all about and where is football heading a mate of mate a week in week out regular at ot and all away games for the past 35 years man and boy stopped going when ferdinands wage demands became public he has never been to a game since either a eureka moment or mid life crisis pays your money and take your choice
1772595 were going to be the first football team on the moon
1772596 if theres a football club with a heart out there nothing flash sense of humour preferable looking for a new fan give me a call as for city ill be back when thaksins done with his plaything to help with the rebuilding
1772597 i abandoned my first love in sport and turned to my second rugby and what a contrast i have found there a season ticket half the price of premier football friendly and welcoming fans who i can drink with when i travel away safe in the knowledge they wont abuse or assault me families given incentives to attend and overall a great game that with a few minor exceptions of course sets an example in team spirit and adhering to the referees authority i have paid my money and i have my choice i wouldnt dream of going back
1772598 congratulations sir you appear to have also been given the license to indulge in smug self satisfaction that rugby fans have long enjoyed thats real value for money
1772599 there was contact so he was entitled to go down
1772600 they paid for tickets replica shirts and sky tv kept the show on the road and deserve whatever comes their way
1772601 he may not be as good as he used to be but somehow i think id swap even johnny howson for a bit of the buck toothed one silky skills
1772602 beware the moral high ground is just as treacherous as the den of moral iniquity you imagine football to be
1772603 my morality has less than nothing to do with the darker elements at work in football today and precisely f ck all to do with why i follow sport in the first place
1772604 as a certain jimmy greaves said at the time maybe people will realise that buying a ticket doesnt give spectators the right to launch foulmouthed abuse at players
1772605 im not claiming a position of power or influence but its still my game to an extent that no amount of sleaze can remove im sticking with it
1772606 a greater problem i face is that they and my partner are man u fans and my liverpool support isnt rubbing off on them one little bit christ knows why

1772708 stanford calif aug 05 2008 business wire a drug commonly used in the developing world to prevent transmission of hiv from mother to child persists in the breast milk and blood of the mothers putting them and their babies at risk for developing drug resistant strains of the virus according to researchers at the stanford university school of medicine
1772709 the researchers found that the drug nevirapine stays in the blood and breast milk of the infected mothers for at least two weeks during that time the virus has ample opportunity to transform itself into drug resistant strains of hiv the human immunodeficiency virus that causes aids which can be very difficult to treat
1772710 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1772711 seble kassaye md instructor in infectious diseases and first author of the study will present the results aug 5 at the international aids conference in mexico city
1772712 sixty five percent of the mothers had drug resistant strains in their breast milk as well with the potential to pass this on to their babies through breastfeeding a common mode of viral transmission
1772713 last year 420 000 babies were born hiv positive the large majority of them to hiv infected mothers in sub saharan africa according to figures from the united nations joint programme on hiv aids the centerpiece of public health programs in the developing world to stop mother to child transmission of hiv are both zidovudine azt and nevirapine which have been used as preventive tools in nearly 900 000 women and infants worldwide

1772719 nevirapine may be used as an alternative to efavirenz for the initial nnrti based regimen in women with pretreatment cd4 counts 250 mm3 and in men with pretreatment cd4 counts gt 400 mm3 nevirapine thus should be initiated in these patients only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk close monitoring for elevated liver enzymes and skin rash should be undertaken for all patients during the first 18 weeks of nevirapine therapy nevirapine was associated with greater toxicity see below and did not meet criteria for non inferiority compared with efavirenz two deaths were attributed to nevirapine use one resulted from fulminant hepatitis and one from staphylococcal sepsis as a complication of stevens johnson syndrome pp 18 19
1772720 serious hepatic events have been observed when nevirapine was initiated in treatment na ve patients these events generally occur within the first few weeks of treatment in addition to experiencing elevated serum transaminases approximately half of the patients also develop skin rash with or without fever or flu like symptoms a 12 fold higher incidence of symptomatic hepatic events was seen in women including pregnant women with cd4 counts gt 250 cells mm3 at the time of nevirapine initiation most of these patients had no identifiable underlying hepatic abnormalities in some cases hepatic injuries continued to progress despite discontinuation of nevirapine 129 131 more detailed recommendations on the management of nevirapine associated hepatic events can be found in table 18a whose heading is potentially life threatening and serious adverse events p 19
1772721 female patients seem to have a higher propensity of developing stevens johnson syndrome and symptomatic hepatic events from nevirapine p 29
1772722 because nevirapine is an inducer of the drug metabolizing hepatic enzymes administration of full therapeutic doses of nevirapine without a 2 week low dose escalation phase will result in excess plasma drug levels and potentially increase the risk for toxicity p 41
1772723 hepatic failure and death have been reported among a small number of pregnant patients p 48
1772724 disadvantages table 9 higher incidence of rash than with other nnrtis including rare but serious hypersensitivity reactions stevens johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis higher incidence of hepatotoxicity than with other nnrtis including serious and even fatal cases of hepatic necrosis
1772725 severe life threatening and in some cases fatal hepatotoxicity including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure has been reported patients may present with nonspecific prodromes of hepatitis and progress to hepatic failure women with cd4 counts gt 250 cells mm3 including pregnant women receiving chronic treatment for hiv infection are at considerably higher risk of hepatotoxicities severe life threatening and even fatal skin reactions including stevens johnson syndrome toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash constitutional findings and organ dysfunction have occurred with nevirapine treatment patients should be monitored intensively during the first 18 weeks of nevirapine therapy to detect potentially life threatening hepatotoxicity or skin reactions a 14 day lead in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily must be followed strictly nevirapine should not be restarted after severe hepatic skin or hypersensitivity reactions

1772779 i think we need a shower ill wash your back if youll wash mine
1772780 he opened the side door of the car lit a match threw it inside and walked away
1772781 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
1772782 were still in the fight well be pushing very hard over the break
1772783 we are very sad for felipe because he did in my view the best race of his career today
1772784 it was fantastic in the way he attacked and the way he managed the race so we are very disappointed for that
1772785 i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship the confidence and thats the most important thing
1772786 i think for the moment everything is completely open we have three cars in a very small gap in terms of points
1772787 hes very strong for sure this kind of race if youre able mentally to manage after the disappointment you have you will only get stronger
1772788 and this is what were going to do together because that is the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia

1772797 i dont necessarily agree 100 percent but i get the point
1772798 ill put it this way i feel like im better as a race car driver than ive ever been i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i can tell you that i feel like ive learned a lot
1772799 the championship ultimately winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad
1772800 its when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck you know somethings happened
1772801 do you go on and self destruct or do you manage to be in the frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it
1772802 right now they and carl and bob are in the same league with the best unless youve got that level of maturity and wisdom and presence and experience that gives you that within the organization having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it
1772803 when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carl is going to be able to overcome that this year im real confident
1772804 what would happen if a movie like this was made by a great director
1772805 we have gone into an entirely new period of nuclear weapons most people have no conception of what it all means a nuclear exchange lasting sixty minutes would mean over 300 million deaths we have to prevent the end of the human race
1772806 we started too late would we like to absolutely but weve had that conversation there was a moment when we thought about it but it doesnt make sense outside of the possibility of adopting which right now doesnt really appeal to us
1772807 to christian and staff thanks for the irish stew and the irish love happy christmas even though its july adam sandler
1772808 adam really enjoyed his evening soaking up the traditional irish atmosphere
1772809 its a topic thats close to my heart i was homeless for a year and saw first hand how sometimes the streets can be safer than whats at home
1772810 he whispered into her ear and she listened with rapt attention he brushed his hand on her back they had nice chemistry
1772811 im friends with the beckhams collectively as a couple and it makes me upset that somebody would ever insinuate what they are insinuating
1772812 so many actors and stars have come to see it on broadway and weve gotten inquiries people are enthusiastic about the film version
1772813 the movie was a chance for me to go back to it painting and realise that i am the worst painter ever born so thank god i was lucky in my acting thing
1772814 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
1772815 it doesnt matter what your beliefs are this was just a senseless act committed in a house of worship im sure a lot of people will be stepping up to help and we just wanted to do something to stand with these folks
1772816 nick was an especially wonderful child so when he started acting with a bad attitude i knew something was wrong
1772817 with diabetes youll get these weird cravings out of nowhere while on tour i started craving pizza hut that was it that was all i needed im usually pretty flexible when it comes to food choice but this time i was really stubborn that i had to have pizza hut and i made them pull the tour bus over
1772818 edges genuine genius developing on the blank and bleached photographic paper avoiding all the obvious blues scales that blind every other guitar player that ever heard led zeppelin
1772819 the edge finds some new colours for the spectrum of rock colours he now owns owning a colour wow imagine owning the colour yellow like van gogh edge owns well im not exactly sure what colours they are indigo or violet or crimson but you sense an emotional colour temperature that is unique to him its his palette were painting from
1772820 surely this is the most influential guitarist since the great composers jimmy page pete townshend neil young but remember he doesnt have the history of the blues to plumb these are uncharted waters was to the english psychedelic revival we were also inspired by and plundering

1772846 its been a very nice thing to do to actually get down and resolve this
1772847 its incredible to see the work that went into digging out the ditch these people were doing something on a scale that had never ever been attempted before you see the excavated sections today and you can imagine what it was like back then it would have been absolutely amazing
1772848 it certainly took us a lot of time and energy simply removing its soft silts and fill completely rock cut the ditch in this sector is deep very broad and flat bottomed working at its base makes you realise just how impressive this monument must have appeared when it was first excavated back in the third millennium bc similarly you appreciate the sheer scale of labour that was involved in cutting through the rock to form the ditch let alone in quarrying and moving the stones forming the circle
1772849 when we look at the excavated area the ditch bulges outwards and appears to contract in the adjacent unexcavated area to me this suggests that rather than being originally dug as a single entity the ditch was probably dug in segments
1772850 the beautifully round regular circle that appears to surround the monument today is due to the subsequent peat growth which makes it look like a smooth circle
1772851 its difficult to know how long it took to dig
1772852 perhaps it was a gradual process perhaps over many years and involving different groups of people were the people who brought in the stones responsible for digging their own segment of the ditch if thats the case it could have taken several hundred years to build
1772853 theres long been this idea that a chief said do this
1772854 my suggestion is that these communities were quite fiercely competitive the ring rather than being this harmonious temple structure that was a joint effort between different communities was maybe the site of some really quite competitive behaviour with the various groups attempting to outdo the other with visible shows of prestige and power labour and the deployment of labour was a visible mark of prestige
1772855 the great feat of labour employed in the digging of the ditch provides some insight into just how important this separation was to neolithic people
1772856 from this evidence it is quite clear that in the northern area at least standing water collected soon after the ditch was dug
1772857 but in terms of architecture the circle may not have been the most significant point in the landscape
1772858 the excavation was really more about the retrieval of samples and the subsequent results that will come after the fieldwork is complete
1772859 although the excavations 35 years ago were undertaken to obtain dating material and establish chronology they failed due to the limitations of available dating techniques at the time
1772860 bob mcculloch and his partner mary who came from stirling university to sample the sections retrieved the samples successfully and bob had some interesting observations about the ditch having filled in very rapidly and perhaps being infilled deliberately these issues will become clearer when the lab work has been done on the samples
1772861 meanwhile weve had david sanderson here from the scottish universities environment research centre suerc undertaking his sampling for dating purposes his results look promising so we could get some good dates that will allow us to put a date on when the ditch was created
1772862 in fact weve found a lot of the missing stone socket holes from this we can confirm that the circle today contains a fraction of the stones that once stood on the site
1772863 whereas resistivity surveys take readings on a square grid in plan tomography surveys take resistance readings in section like for instance a brain scan which also employs tomography
1772864 we placed 40 probes spaced at 50 centimetre intervals and equal depths and took readings on each probe increasing the spacing at each of seven or eight runs
1772865 the software then produces readings in the shape of an inverted truncated pyramid representing a depth of two metres or so from the ground surface
1772866 i think hes probably just as qualified as everybody else up there that knows nothing about the art form of the business
1772867 theres no fabric so i imagine when its crowded it would be deafening
1772868 suddenly thrown out of my usual appearance complacence into a desperate desire to be fashionable and look stunning
1772869 disturbs us that we feel we cannot publish it right now
1772870 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
1772871 listen i study these folks for a living and publishing this is really gonna tick em off if you publish it
1772872 hey i have an advance copy of a book and it makes fun of muslims so you should warn everyone
1772873 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
1772874 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
1772875 those eyes her unequally cut fringe this red painted lock of hair i just knew it was her
1772876 she came right to me to pat my dog then i let her go
1772877 stupid i let her walk away such a beautiful girl
1772878 i think its stupid because maybe they could have done something more at that time and maybe now its too late to find any clue
1772879 maybe not even the dutch police but more the british or portuguese police because at that time i remember the police told me they were suspecting the parents themselves
1772880 flight international has an interesting article about the testing of a new
1772881 i just absolutely wouldnt even fathom the idea of performing in front of people
1772882 it wasnt even something i did do for a long time it was that traumatic
1772883 i wasnt used to singing solo in front of so many people
1772884 when she was done i found it to be very interesting
1772885 i suggested that if she ever wanted to contemporize this music and do something with it in a bigger production that we should talk about it
1772886 they would know the song we were singing look at the translation and see that is what they say in church in english
1772887 this led to many wonderful conversations the level of energy that existed in the room at these sessions was very profound
1772888 its very appropriate for her to submit what weve done
1772889 it was one of the most difficult and intense things ive ever done im proud of the cd and thats not something ive been comfortable saying
1772890 it went really well i had some performance anxiety beforehand but it just wasnt an issue it was wonderful for me to see that there is some healing going on
1772891 going into the athletic commission where youre appointed by the governor and confirmed by the senate what happened to me comes with the territory its just the way it is
1772892 with the help of my staff i restored professional boxing to the state of new york
1772893 when i entered there were only 17 pro boxing events and boxing was declining two years ago there were 38 events last year there were 37 and this year there will be around the same
1772894 we did that with very few serious injuries there were no life threatening injuries or fatal accidents during that time i know how to surround an event with professionals and take away the inherent dangers of the sport without taking away the drama
1772895 the core function of the commission is the health and safety of the boxer
1772896 so that became one of my primary concerns as chairman
1772897 in the cross of christ as in a splendid theatre the incomparable goodness of god is set before the whole world the glory of god shines indeed in all creatures on high and below but never more brightly than in the cross in which there was a wonderful change of things the condemnation of all men was manifested sin blotted out salvation restored to men in short the whole world was renewed and all things restored to order

1772926 although the evidence is still controversial i am convinced that there are sufficient data to warrant issuing an advisory to share some precautionary advice on cell phone use
1772927 the overwhelming majority of studies that have been published in scientific journals around the globe show that wireless phones do not pose a health risk
1772928 the most difficult thing to resolve is whether there is an effect with long term mobile phone use
1772929 its time for the interphone to come out its a public health issue
1772930 the thing that were the most excited about is we are getting our whole college together
1772931 well have everyone within walking distance running into each other and able to have conversations
1772932 we have 15 new offices for fellows all on the same floor which will dramatically facilitate interaction between the fellows
1772933 this will allow people to have more face to face contact which will really create a community of scholars
1772934 the board felt strongly that to enhance campus life we wanted to put as many of the student organizations together into that north wing of the building
1772935 having several clubs in the same space will hopefully encourage communication
1772936 itll be really cool to just have a place where people will know that they can come to find us
1772937 we want it to be a place where anyone whos greek can come hang out or anyone whos not greek can come to find out about us we want it to be a space where everyone can come and feel comfortable
1772938 originally we expected construction to be done in early august
1772939 its been delayed until several days before school starts but were hopeful things will be ready in time for the new semester
1772940 id bring my laptop a lot more if there were more accessible power outlets around the room
1772941 a significant part of our teaching involves case study the rooms will be tiered so students can see each other theres a lot of teamwork interaction
1772942 the business school has a lot of students and we need technology that helps us succeed
1772943 having two more buildings would give us the opportunity for new building names and more donations
1772944 we wanted to tell the neighbors about what this person is doing so that maybe they can do something
1772945 the future development should create a vibrant campus center associated commercial uses and housing on the site
1772946 to date the timeline for the universe project has not been determined
1772947 a value based selection is underway for the developer of the universe project
1772948 as the first step in this effort the u issued a request for qualifications seeking a qualified development team to plan design construct and own and manage some components of the development
1772949 the universe project is currently in the process of being presented for approval by the u board of trustees and board of regents the state building board and the 2009 session of the state legislature
1772950 i know they said they would build just as many as are now available but they arent factoring in how we already need an increase in parking
1772951 they have been in the business of building student life centers for a very long time
1772952 it is going to link the health sciences campus with main campus
1772953 we have dedicated space for weight lifting an aquatic center sports courts a climbing wall lounges and caf s
1772954 they have a lot of skill and have a deep knowledge base
1772955 the field house is ancient with lots of old equipment and is awfully warm
1772956 i am happy with the old building but the new building sounds even cooler
1772957 experience shows that gifts of that size are many many months in the making
1772958 the museums job is to educate people about the natural world and trail users are certainly key to that
1772959 i have friends who ride through there on their way to work and rerouting will make it longer and less enjoyable
1772960 if we had more classrooms or learning space we would be able to serve a lot of the public schools
1772961 right now we turn groups away because we just dont have the room for them
1772962 i think it will definitely be overcrowded and kind of a hassle
1772963 id probably find a new trail if it gets really bad
1772964 but that road is pretty narrow so it definitely creates a safety issue
1772965 i think if they do a good job of reconstructing the trail and clean up after themselves thats fine
1772966 id rather have the trail open and the museum on both sides than not open at all
1772967 there is already a tension between walkers runners and bikers and i think that will probably just increase
1772968 this community has grown enormously since we opened in 1969 and we havent been able to grow with it
1772969 we only have 24 000 square feet of exhibit space and its just not big enough for what people ask us to show
1772970 especially since a lot of my classes have been on the east side
1772971 im always late for class and think ill be able to walk through the library but cant
1772972 students can go write their paper get technical assistance and receive reference help all in one place
1772973 without their support we couldnt do what we do weve got so many people working on different things all the time theyre priceless to me
1772974 our campus and students have fully made the switch to using the internet as their primary source for information and communication
1772975 its necessary to move asuu further in that direction through electronic filing for student groups online interest form sign ups and various other aspects these things will make asuu much more efficient
1772976 one of the most important tasks is to earn the trust of the students by being completely open about how their student funds are being spent
1772977 we dont want to be a student government that assumes we know whats best for you but rather we want to ask you what you think is best
1772978 oh boy oh boy i have the perfect costume for mexican wrestling night and the comic con i got this great red and blue spider man costume and im going to be mad awesome everyone at comic cons going to be doing weird characters but you cant go wrong with the red amp blue classy classy classy ill just wear it to mexican wrestling night then off to the con floor
1772979 basim is highly respected by his peers and the university
1772980 his outstanding leadership experience among students will be a great asset to the board of regents
1772981 i look forward to serving my fellow students throughout the state my job is to effectively represent them ive always been the type who goes all out in whatever im involved in
1772982 its a good program for students that know what they want to do
1772983 unfortunately we dont always see a lot of students in that position
1772984 we have mandatory orientation and mandatory advising unlike usu so we have good ways to get the message across to students
1772985 we have a lot of priorities but this is up there
1772986 if we end up with a significant minority of students participating and everyone being more conscious of long term planning the graduation guarantee program will be a success
1772987 its the same thing but we dont quite have the glowing light thing in the chest or the ability to knock airplanes out of the sky
1772988 what you want to do is reduce the number of people in combat
1772989 you can have less people out there and be more agile
1772990 you put it on and it basically senses where you want to move and it moves there
1772991 when we put people in it in five or six seconds they know how to run it
1772992 we have yet to find very many things we ask it to do and it wont
1772993 theres never a dull moment you dont have time to get bored
1772994 i dont know if they could find their rear end with both hands
1772995 our primary concern is for the sensitive information and correcting the problems that allowed this to happen in the first place
1772996 i never thought the price of gas would get to where it is today
1772997 nobody likes the parking increase but at this point we had no other choice
1772998 well be continuing renovations for the next two years hospitals are constantly undergoing some kind of renovation
1772999 we literally had to do this expansion on our front doors
1773000 people had to get through the construction site which is not a welcoming environment we have hospital valet now though
1773001 the building may not withstand a major earthquake and it has to be either renovated like the capitol or rebuilt
1773002 theyre getting doctors together to talk about what should be included in the building
1773003 we want to coordinate specialty care so its easier for patients to go to different specialists but before we can start designing a building we have to see where other university buildings will be located
1773004 we need to bring in a bone marrow transplant center another 50 beds and more space to put it all
1773005 itll take about 200 000 square feet to make it big enough
1773006 weve only talked about the ground breaking in spring 2009 but it may be bumped up to fall 2008
1773007 we might have the ceremonial groundbreaking in conjunction as the university does its big announcement for its fundraising campaign in october
1773008 almost every semester well have students come in to apply for child care and only a set number of those students will be able to put their children in these programs
1773009 we always have students come in with child care emergencies
1773010 theyll often ask if we do drop ins for one to two hours but the university does not offer any drop in programs to the general population of students
1773011 occasionally ill have a student bring in their child due to a child care emergency or saying their baby sitter fell through its more common for students to bring their children into my office
1773012 it doesnt bother me as long as someone is quiet and well behaved no matter what age they are
1773013 unless it bothers other students that are paying good money to get something out of my class then it becomes an issue
1773014 they have a subsidy program through the child care center but overall its still pretty dang expensive
1773015 the staff turnover is too high which is hard on the kids and their need for consistency
1773016 a lot of times i would wake up late and end up having to drive
1773017 traditionally 30 to 34 percent of the student body take mass transit
1773018 when such a convenient way to cut down fossil fuel usage is available we owe it to ourselves to take advantage of it
1773019 realistically not everyone is going to be able to have a bike on the train
1773020 weve had eight outages in the last 12 months and if the trends were seeing keep going these outages are going to get longer
1773021 the funding we request would be considered during the next legislative session in spring
1773022 steel buried in ground only lasts 20 to 30 years
1773023 the main feed that usually serves five to 10 buildings is now serving about 20 buildings
1773024 outages in the past year resulted in more than 400 hours of down time which equals to a total 16 days last year where some part of campus was without power
1773025 i do have a car but pretty much only use that to go to the grocery store once a week
1773026 hopefully we find some kind of alternative fuel source pretty soon prices are getting kind of ridiculous and its just going to get worse
1773027 the bicycle population is very automotive savvy so i think its a bicycle friendly area
1773028 the more students get involved the more likely it will happen
1773029 once you get to campus try to leave your car in one place
1773030 if you have a job downtown leave your car here and take the train back and forth
1773031 the u has the most students who use public transportation with gas prices the way they are were expecting ridership to increase as it has
1773032 i get really stressed out in a car and foothill during rush hour is not very much fun
1773033 i love being at the u because its such a terrific university and i look forward to being here in the future
1773034 its fun to work with someone whos always excited about whats going on around campus
1773035 the guy knows how to manage a big organization and hes got a great managerial style
1773036 i was taken by how radically different everything was but at the same time japan was addressing the same problems being addressed in the u s here in america were unified by an idea but in japan theyre unified more by geography and race and that was very very different it was a fascinating experience
1773037 after law school i had planned to go into practice in california but i got a job clerking at the supreme court and schools started approaching me about teaching
1773038 i hadnt really even thought about it but i began to realize that while regular law interested me the relationship between law and society and how we shape and engage the legal system really lit me up no law firm would pay me to research that but i knew that schools certainly would
1773039 timing is everything when i came down i was given all the state departments legal work for europe three weeks into the job the berlin wall came down and i became a lawyer for the u s delegation for german unification talks it was a fascinating experience
1773040 utah seemed like an interesting opportunity and a great university i wouldnt have left george washington if it wasnt
1773041 but i had no idea how great it was until i actually got here
1773042 achieving excellence is hard but maintaining it can sometimes be impossible
1773043 thats why not only do we need to be deep but weve got to be broad as well every student should know as much about bangalore as they do about baltimore our students really deserve the highest level of education they deserve to work with professors of nobel laureate quality
1773044 they hoped that once we had gotten up and running with the program wed be able to add the extra 10 million
1773045 we took a bit of a gamble and said wed start those groups
1773046 if they have success well outstrip the available money in 2009
1773047 we were disappointed it may take a long time to develop but its important
1773048 lately theyve been in the middle of hiring new people
1773049 were interested in figuring out how different neurosystems are wired together
1773050 my collaborators are focusing on the retina and how it takes visual input and processes it before sending signals to the brain
1773051 the ultimate goal of ustar is to create new businesses
1773052 its not everyday that your player beats the no 1 ranked player in the country
1773053 we are excited about this years schedule and i feel that we have been able to upgrade it considerably
1773054 my philosophy and the philosophy of our program from this point forth is that in order to be the best you must compete against the best additionally you have to be able to get them to come to your home venue
1773055 the motivation for the council to hire an in house attorney was the opportunity to save money
1773056 this really reduces the hourly cost of having an attorney
1773057 we did a fairly comprehensive analysis of this and having someone at our fingertips will be an asset to the city
1773058 on the other hand giles is not an expert at every aspect
1773059 litigation costs have risen significantly and my challenges include getting litigation cases against the city resolved and helping the council in its efforts to negotiate the revenue neutrality agreement
1773060 it is published in the us directory and many students use that e mail address to register for things online
1773061 the universitys information security operations team takes steps to block phishing websites and e mail please send any e mails you think are phishy as attachments to us we can then work to prevent future attacks but you should never assume that all phishers are blocked
1773062 all of the coaching staff was in a position they had never been in before
1773063 none of us have a lot of years under our belts
1773064 there arent a lot of kids that can take the entire load of pitching on their shoulders
1773065 and for an incoming freshman from utah that is a very big task
1773066 as an underdog teams sometimes overlook you and dont bring their best game to the field
1773067 having so much depth on the mound will really help when it comes to conference teams
1773068 after you play a team once or twice they know everything you have with four pitchers you can really mix that up
1773069 in the past the program has lacked those players with the never say die type of attitude
1773070 but this year we have those girls that are ready to fight that have the bring it on personality that will really help us
1773071 we dont believe we have a lack of talent anywhere
1773072 the bottom line is we feel very good about our entire personnel this season
1773073 when you open up at michigan on the road its obviously a stiff challenge
1773074 you can talk about bcs this and bcs that but you kinda try to go after the odd coaching clich of one game at a time
1773075 we want to be back in a jan 1 bowl game and try to bust open the bcs thats what our goals are this year
1773076 with bradon godfrey brent casteel and freddie brown you add in aiona key and david reed i think we have an amazing opportunity at wide receiver
1773077 isleib is one of the best attacking players in the country
1773078 we have a good group of attacking players and in particular i think we have some really good wide attacking players
1773079 a lot of them will contribute right away whether they start or come off the bench
1773080 they are extremely hard working and smart soccer players and i think they will adapt to the college game pretty quickly
1773081 were going to find out a lot about ourselves over the first six or seven games
1773082 it is always challenging to come into a program with athletes recruited by a different coach but the team really embraced my leadership and philosophy
1773083 they are definitely familiar with the black line on the bottom of the pool
1773084 ninety percent of the team stayed and trained this summer
1773085 that really helped us build a strong foundation for next season
1773086 we are really expecting big things out of all of them
1773087 we are not going to be so focused on the outcomes of duel meets but rather just go out there and swim our best and then just let things be
1773088 it would be disappointing if the women didnt take first
1773089 its all about building that confidence getting them to believe in themselves
1773090 duke and kivisto were extremely reliable fully committed to this program and would do anything you asked them to and whenever you asked them to do it they would do a great job
1773091 i expect baskett and kim to lead us and they seem prepared to do that
1773092 off season rest will take care of both of them
1773093 im excited about both girls and i expect them to step in and help us immediately
1773094 mcallister is strong in her gymnastics and loves to be out in front of people which is a great quality to have if youre going to be a gymnast in utah
1773095 overall they are a very talented team and only time will tell how consistent they will be as a result of their youth
1773096 week in and week out having to be at your best really prepares you for the end of the season
1773097 not only is this team mature but they are extremely focused
1773098 people are prone to hold to their views tenaciously regardless of evidence or argument
1773099 has made a career out of turning out venomous anti israel articles and now has turned his ann arbor classroom into an anti israel indoctrination camp
1773100 its not good for any group of people to spend a lot of time listening only to like minded others it is especially bad for a profession whose lifeblood is the exchange of ideas
1773101 institutions purportedly committed to independence of mind are in fact all too often bastions of intellectual monoculture
1773102 we struggled the last two games of the season but we had a great season with a lot of success
1773103 louisville is a top 10 team and is deep in talent
1773104 students working 1 to 15 hours a week have a significantly higher gpa than students working 16 or more hours and students who dont work at all
1773105 real world experience that can contribute to someones education and make classes seem more relevant
1773106 hundreds even thousands of students come through here each year
1773107 once into the service a lot of people become more altruistic
1773108 i was proud of our guys in the fact that they hung in there
1773109 particularly after that one loss against byu that they still had the fortitude to come back and play probably as good of baseball they did all year after that
1773110 it was good to finish the tournament the way that we did and at the end of the year as you want to do we were playing our best baseball
1773111 you hope that some of the new guys that we signed will take place of the guys we lost
1773112 the one thing that im really anxious about is that were going to have much more depth than we had last year
1773113 first and foremost the center teaches a passion for music
1773114 in the 16 months since we opened the music box ive witnessed major positive developments in the personal responsibility social skills and work ethic of the kids who participate
1773115 since opening the first music box at 1235 weve had a steady stream of kids come in off the street and literally just jump into writing performing and recording their own songs
1773116 im really excited to be at utah and im excited for what were building
1773117 we established a foundation that we were going to be a defensive minded team
1773118 we were more physical we were tougher and we were more competitive now we need to win those games that we were competitive in
1773119 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents
1773120 getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
1773121 it has been a great year and a half working with and against many of you
1773122 ive enjoyed the freezing and sweltering pressers that we have shared and wish you all the very best
1773123 i didnt think much of it till about the fifth body these things happen every year at least four to five people die every year this is a regular sight but that day the bodies just didnt stop coming
1773124 when i called my friend there he said there had been a stampede on the top and by the looks of it he thought at least 500 people had died
1773125 i alone would have carried some 20 bodies down to the bus stand from where they were taken to the hospital in anandpur sahib which is at the foothills
1773126 when i reached there the sight i saw would be difficult to stomach even for the bravest heart the first thing i saw was a heap of dead bodies not like anybody had piled them but as though that is how they were when they died there were seven bodies on top of each other imagine how the melee would have been
1773127 todays commission decision is a decisive step towards meeting the european goal of reducing road accidents
1773128 getting critical messages through quickly and accurately is a must for road safety
1773129 if you added up all of our investments in sql server 2008 it was data warehouse scale that got the highest level of investment
1773130 in our view sql server is a lot more than a database
1773131 our intent here is to provide a consistent platform such that you as an application provider have a consistent model to think about
1773132 we will provide a consistent data model across all tiers whether it be the edge the data center or the cloud
1773133 if you added up all of our investments in sql server 2008 it was data warehouse scale that got the highest level of investment

1773139 its all been hot as hell on a run like this
1773140 josh turner makes alan jackson look like a rocker but the fans love him
1773141 there are lots of people its really beautiful here and its just a very relaxing atmosphere
1773142 look out at the crowd and youll see 1 000 american flags in peoples hats its good old fashioned american redneck fun
1773143 exercise gives you endorphins endorphins make you happy happy people just dont shoot their husbands
1773144 rub your hands together briskly then lightly press them to your closed eyes with your fingers pointing upward
1773145 visualize comfort emanating from them and let the warmth soothe your eyes
1773146 only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go
1773147 my parents would give me and my brother comic books from the tooth fairy and hide them under our pillows
1773148 a lot of people look at comics and think its really bad wall art
1773149 too often with comic books especially indie pulp and noir comics youll have the hard boiled narration going on the whole time thats overwrought and overdone
1773150 some panels you leave open whereas with some panels you want more detail you want to fill it in more
1773151 its like the whole pixies loud soft loud soft thing its how you create drama
1773152 in 1994 i took a trip to england and saw a sheep dog event and was blown away by it
1773153 americans love dog competitions and so i decided to bring a competition to the states
1773154 the spring after the 2002 olympics i found soldier hollow i quickly arranged a meeting with the director of soldier hollow two weeks later and he enthusiastically supported my idea to host a sheep dog competition
1773155 when you tell people that you are into sheepdog competitions they give you a quizzical look
1773156 but what i tell them is to close their eyes and imagine wimbledon it is just as dramatic and has a tense ambience with a touch of hushed elegance
1773157 there is something about the activity of sheepdog herding that brings people together
1773158 i have seen people from the country mesh with city folk and together they become experts on the competition in two hours it has an intellectual quality that is not only complex but strategic
1773159 we have the staff and infrastructure so we can do more exhibits of this scale
1773160 hopefully there will be more blockbuster exhibits of this kind
1773161 in the show you have this progression of artists getting more and more abstract and drawing attention to the materiality of the medium
1773162 the collection has many impressionist paintings that people will have seen in reproduction but never in person
1773163 when they were looking for venues to host it they wanted to find more up and coming cities to find new audiences such as vancouver nashville detroit and salt lake city the exhibit has had record attendance in all these cities
1773164 people dont really know him as a painter but he spent the first few years of his career painting we have two drawings by smithson that we unearthed it is important to educate people about the jetty and get them going out there
1773165 we are a small institution and we are growing so we are going through some growing pains
1773166 i think there are various challenges trying to get people to know that we are here on the university campus i am really excited about serving the universitys needs and getting university students to come more and more
1773167 for these reasons ladies and gentlemen were here to ask you to vote for senator obama and to support his candidacy not just because youre democrats but because youre veterans
1773168 cranberry hill was a ten acre plot that a developer bought from a farmer about 15 years ago and turned into family homes
1773169 there arent any hills unless you count the pile of dirt next to that half finished foundation over there
1773170 and the soil is too sandy and dry for cranberry bogs i think they grew barley here before
1773171 it was really amazing my brother set up a performance space in an old factory in new york and i know lots of people have taken over broken down buildings and done cool things with them but i never thought you could do that with a place like this until now i guess
1773172 it used to be that the urban areas were the places people didnt care about but people care a lot about them now
1773173 but nobody cares about this thats the appeal i think theres beauty here you know i came here to bring it out and remind people
1773174 ode to a place and time that we feel is slipping away and want to preserve for others to experience our suburbs are disappearing every day and its important to stop that to remind people of why we built them in the first place thats what this art and this collective are all about
1773175 i cant go buddy docs orders my numbers are still a little off and will be back to normal soon
1773176 i was in the docs office this morning getting checked out then they had to weigh me shit they had to take me down to the grain elevator they hoisted me up and everything 134 pounds on the dot
1773177 i was looking forward to ferreting out a bunch of shit i didnt need
1773178 just cant take the chance kid feeling a little off the last couple weeks
1773179 ive been practicing too i have a strategy not sharing it with you assholes either
1773180 other than that everything is cool ill keep honing my skills
1773181 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
1773182 its the kind of show you have to bring something to you cant just come and sit back and let it happen you have to bring your memories you have to bring your 1993 self
1773183 when you first mention it to artists a lot of them their initial reaction is whats wrong with our new stuff
1773184 some people mistake what were doing with dont look back that were just trying to be quite retro
1773185 after every single record ive finished ive said in my own head or to other people wouldnt it be great if we could just go out and perform it top to bottom
1773186 as i perform the songs i had the time and focus to really think about what i was thinking about when i wrote that song
1773187 i put off listening to the album for a long time
1773188 the first time i tried to listen to it i couldnt even make it all the way through it it was kind of boring to me but after a few listens it grew on me
1773189 were trying to get it back to sounding like the record
1773190 even the songs that weve been playing its relearning those
1773191 im looking forward to a whole tour of not having to make any set lists
1773192 i have such a huge catalogue now that i dont get to play a lot of the songs
1773193 and i miss a lot of them we only have so much room in the set i loved the idea because it kind of satisfied my need to get all those songs out again
1773194 i watched the drivers head explode as the height difference of the two vehicles laid it on the line
1773195 the gunman next to him screamed openmouthed in horror all hatred and disdain wiped clear from his eyes by disbelief as the assault rounds sliced into him too and tracked through his body

1773207 well be moving players around figuring out what works thats what you do the first couple of weeks of the season
1773208 who is going to fill the setting role this year
1773209 stephanie gained invaluable experience last year as a freshman but she is still young
1773210 setting is our biggest question mark right now its just a matter of how ready they are to set
1773211 last year connie and kate robison passed 70 percent of our balls
1773212 we knew we were losing them to graduation and we have people ready to fill those spots
1773213 thats going to help her a lot with leadership on and off the court
1773214 lori and kathryn learned a lot about how to be go to players last season
1773215 they know what this is about and they are excellent leaders fans should be excited to see them on the court
1773216 we have a good strong schedule both conference and non conference play will be tough
1773217 there is just going to be a lot of great volleyball for the fans to enjoy
1773218 i try snorting cocaine off of my baby before passing out
1773219 there had been some concerns raised by the office of legal counsel about whether taking royalties from books that you have the authority to assign violates the utah public officers and employees ethics act
1773220 the message the policy sends is that we cant trust you
1773221 it passed by a margin of four or five votes
1773222 we dont want students thinking the reason they have to buy a textbook is so the teacher gains
1773223 in a sense we do profit from students because faculty salary partly comes from tuition but this policy implies that students and faculty have goals different than educating students
1773224 professors do have a lot of power over their students so any policy that assures students that they are not merely a marketing category is valuable
1773225 the royalties most of us receive on our books are so small that the policy will make little practical difference one way or the other
1773226 the idea that a professor would assign a book to make money is ridiculous
1773227 if you think writing academic books is going to be a money maker youre wrong
1773228 professors sometimes only make 50 cents on every book sold
1773229 in a class of 24 students the professor will make a pretty small amount
1773230 im seeing a fluctuation between 2 years and the three year mark
1773231 im seeing a lack of patience for individuals who cant deliver results quickly
1773232 they hired you to have impact you cant go in and lay out the five year program that kicks in in year four
1773233 i think people are looking for convenience and health food and im a big advocate of being prepared

1773240 we knew some wouldnt like the move coming in but we hope what we put on the air the viewers will like
1773241 the stations local news operation will benefit from the news gathering sources of nbc and its affiliated stations worldwide
1773242 and wmbf will share regional news content with other raycom media stations in the carolinas and the southeast
1773243 theyre the best experts to predict what theyre going to need to manage their area of operation
1773244 as far as the activity going on here in san diego the agents are needed
1773245 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1773246 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1773247 would have screamed bloody murder if the border patrol had reduced san diego sector staffing levels appreciably

1773251 the all party meeting was of the unanimous view that an environment must be created where the agitation could be suspended and the issues resolved through the process of dialogue
1773252 we are winding up in december and have started scaling down operations
1773253 it has been quite a successful programme we did not start with the objective of taking up the entire rehabilitation work we had an informal agreement with the government of tamil nadu to provide technical back up wherever possible and support the reconstruction and recovery efforts

1773256 it is a big competition so it doesnt matter whether it is your first or third olympics everyone is trying to win and i am working equally hard for it at sydney i was new and didnt realise what it was at athens i was too serious and time just wasnt on my side after athens i almost quit
1773257 so it is a bonus for me here i am competing to fulfil my wish and passion maybe i am addicted to hard work and serious training just cant stay away from shooting whatever happens i am ready to accept happily
1773258 i too am dreaming about the elusive olympic medal but that is not the end of the world for me anymore
1773259 i dont want to think that way the day has to be yours whichever event you are shooting it is difficult to predict many world class shooters have failed to qualify for olympic finals and many olympic medallists have not been able to win any other competition it is altogether a different game
1773260 initially we had problem of ammunition and good infrastructure since i got the quota in 3p i was focusing more on it as good quality and barrel matching ammunition matter a lot as there were many competitions lined up to get air rifle quota for the other indian shooters i decided to practice only 3p
1773261 this wicket will have bounce the spinners the quicker bowlers and the batsman will all enjoy playing on it a little bit of something for everybody
1773262 there are five guys who have captained india so it will just be a case of coordinating that expertise thats already in the team all players have been aware of their responsibility of their roles in the team not only the players but also the management its a just case of doing what we have always been doing
1773263 the key is to prepare as well as possible for every single game every game is critical in test cricket
1773264 we are sitting at a really critical point now one all with one to play
1773265 everyone knows how important it is they dont need too many reminders but we remind them anyway
1773266 and theres some batsmen due runs really its a team game of a whole lot of individuals so individually each person needs to take some responsibility to do something to contribute to the win similarly the team has got to pull together for it to win we have got that individual approach as well as the team approach
1773267 we have received a letter from governor vohra to visit the site we turn it down we have already made the sayss stand clear to the governor that nothing short of revocation of cancellation order and restoration of powers to the board will be acceptable
1773268 i appeal to the people of kashmir including our brothers in poonch rajouri doda and kishtwar to participate in a foot march en route muzaffarabad the date of this programme will be announced after august 15
1773269 the good news is that there are more options in manufacturing companies
1773270 there is a 25 per cent drop in recruitments in almost all top companies many colleges will find themselves on the borderline
1773271 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
1773272 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
1773273 i have no say in that its just whenever they feel im ready
1773274 injection was not anesthesiologys idea american society decided to have capital punishment as part of our legal system and to carry it out with injection the fact that problems are surfacing is not our dilemma the legal system has painted itself into this corner and it is not our obligation to get it out
1773275 taxes have a place in economic policy lotterman praises john mccain for at least beginning to tiptoe away from the obligatory
1773276 inane political fetish that has harmed our nations economy for 20 years by forcing a policy of
1773277 belief unsupported by any reputable economic theory that low taxes somehow trump all other policy considerations
1773278 the coming activist age in the new york times he predicts that the united states is headed for
1773279 stagnation in human capital asserting that the united states has lost its lead in educating its workforce producing
1773280 all this means that the next few years will be an age of government activism
1773281 the true function of the state as it interferes in social life should be to make the chances of competition more even http www typepad com t trackback 2573710 32104468
1773282 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1773283 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era
1773284 as far as im concerned it really puts europe in an advantageous place it puts europe in a favorite role theres just no question about it
1773285 in the past when you looked at the teams on paper you could maybe say it would be close and it turned out the last two werent close at all but to argue that europe wouldnt be the favorite this time around would be very difficult
1773286 if europe beats us again then its time to say maybe they are beating us because they are just that much better they are great at team play and they seem to have some kind of chemistry that works really really well
1773287 the four picks are going to be a little more difficult than i thought
1773288 if i just take the top eight guys that are not in the top eight right now go down to 16 there are a lot of really quality options there for me
1773289 any of those guys im happy with and theres none of those eight guys that know for sure they are going to be on this team
1773290 ill look at carl when i say this and he can slap me if he wants roush said
1773291 he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1773292 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson tony stewart with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1773293 i dont necessarily agree 100 percent but i get the point
1773294 ill put it this way i feel like im better as a race car driver than ive ever been i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i can tell you that i feel like ive learned a lot
1773295 the championship ultimately winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad roush said
1773296 its when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck you know somethings happened
1773297 do you go on and self destruct or do you manage to be in the frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it
1773298 right now they and carl and bob are in the same league with the best unless youve got that level of maturity and wisdom and presence and experience that gives you that within the organization having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it
1773299 when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carl is going to be able to overcome that this year im real confident
1773300 i have hopes still of getting david ragan in the chase which will be real exciting roush said
1773301 of course matt and greg will make a good accounting of themselves too theyre in championship form the organizations look great
1773302 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like china and india that has so many more people than the united states
1773303 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1773304 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weight lifting swimming track and field marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1773305 to me the olympics was founded on amateur sports guys go in there training for four years and putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1773306 it is subscribing to something i regard not to be science
1773307 if conventional doping testing were to be submitted to a regulatory agency such as the u s food and drug admin istration to qualify as a diagnostic test for a disease it would be rejected
1773308 this is a black box with little people running around and we do not know what they are doing this area needs some fresh air it is just anti science not only in its conduct but in its attitude
1773309 it seems like a closed process by which they set these things up they say if somebody is above a certain range the chance of a false positive is one in a billion but you never see the data to support that
1773310 the detection methods undergo rigorous validation prior to being introduced this reliability has been consistently confirmed by tribunals
1773311 it would be useful and very valuable but very expensive
1773312 within a month thered be a book published on how to beat standardized testing procedures
1773313 we have a group of people trying to circumvent testing its unlike any other field i can think of
1773314 the whole testing operation benefits from involvement of first rate scientists and the critique scientists can give
1773315 when i see things i do not agree with i sometimes pass it off but if it affects people it bothers me it eats at me
1773316 recognizing the crap i will go through this is worth it to me we all want to make a difference
1773317 i thought that was the highlight of the race carpentier said
1773318 i was like where the heck did he get that squeegee at i thought maybe he stopped at a gas station on the way to the track it was funny
1773319 if you worry about it youll perform worse most of the time he said
1773320 i went off track a couple of times but the car was fast and hopefully well have the same type of car this weekend
1773321 the last five races and ever since we won the pole in loudon its given us a little bit more confidence and now were running top 20 a little bit more carpentier said
1773322 im starting to battle with the cup drivers a little bit more where i couldnt early on out there
1773323 in indy cars you can attack all the time he said
1773324 you still have to be smooth but you can enter a corner as late as you want and just abuse the car i think you need a little bit more finesse with a stock car than you do with an indy car otherwise you will just burn everything up
1773325 you have to let the car do what it wants he said
1773326 thats the biggest thing ive learned im still learning every race that we go to every track that i race on im still learning a little bit more and more
1773327 things dont happen so fast as when youre in an indy car he said
1773328 even at an oval track like las vegas i was coming down the straightaway and i would snap sideways with the car but on a road course things happen a little bit more slowly
1773329 i like the ovals and thats what i want to do the irl is going away from ovals and for me i have no interest in going back

1773347 were stunned that more legislators have not yet signed the petition
1773348 there are 55 freshman legislators in harrisburg most of whom were elected in 2006 based on their campaign promises of reform were especially disappointed with the individuals that pacleansweep backed who have not signed on
1773349 intent is not good enough we all know where the road paved with good intentions leads
1773350 the road to reform is paved with action pennsylvanians clearly want action and their elected servants ought to comply
1773351 many compare the art of making law with the art of making sausage
1773352 if thats the case then our sausage machine is contaminated with salmonella until we disinfect the machine all sausage produced is guaranteed to make pennsylvanians ill

1773354 sure if theyre for sale the cable system is a jewel and any operator would want it if they could get a reasonable price
1773355 if the cable system ever went on the block the most likely outcome would actually be for comcast and timewarner cable to bid jointly and divide it up
1773356 comcast would end up with north jersey and southern connecticut i dont think comcast would be particularly interested in the other businesses

1773359 the maximum punishment on a manslaughter in the first degree is 25 years the defendant pled guilty to that and agreed to a 21 year sentence which we think is an appropriate sentence it is up toward the maximum and as i said in court i think he deserves every minute of it

1773362 these employees are exempt from the salary basis test and are not subject to any minimum salary requirements and therefore will not receive any compensation until after adoption of a state budget
1773363 forcing public servants to involuntarily loan the state cash by foregoing their hard earned paychecks puts an untenable burden on our teachers health care workers and those who provide critical public services that is just wrong
1773364 we try to mix as many different perspectives as possible
1773365 its not just the ags sitting around talking among themselves
1773366 the plaintiffs lawyers realized they could make a lot of money by handling these sorts of cases for the states
1773367 i would attend the conference if i was invited to speak i would not go to just shake hands
1773368 but the trial lawyers have a vested interest to do that
1773369 one of the purposes of a conference like this one is to hear a variety of opinions
1773370 the aba submits that such an appearance of impropriety may be created where as in the present case a judicial officer denies a recusal motion and continues to sit on a case where one of the parties has made significant contributions to the judges election campaign
1773371 with the cost of judicial campaigns increasing these issues are arising throughout the country and there is need for guidance from the court as to the boundaries imposed by the due process clause in these circumstances
1773372 large campaign expenditures have become a virtual prerequisite for election to state judicial office
1773373 to meet this demand judicial candidates increasingly depend on large contributors
1773374 these elections involve highly reported politicized campaigns marked by million dollar budgets and heated competition this massive influx of money may pose a threat of judicial impropriety both actual and apparent
1773375 it is an unfortunate truth that judicial officers in west virginia must stand for office in political elections
1773376 notwithstanding this political selection method the publics confidence in our system of justice is necessarily undermined and the stability and predictability of the rule of law is compromised when politics cross the threshold of our court
1773377 the most important factors therefore affecting the publics perception of actual justice in this court necessarily are the actual decisions of this court and its members over time the professional demeanor of this courts members and the quality of the written opinions and orders which we produce in specific cases
1773378 by baiting emotions i believe the dissenting opinion adopts a distinctly political voice rather than a judicial voice with due respect to my dissenting colleagues this case does not present a close call on the basis of the rule of law
1773379 were going to watch who were going to endorse in office and were going to watch who and who is not keeping their campaign promises people who break their promises will not have our support in two years but their opponents will

1773391 cornered him on why he hasnt made one of those art films hes always going on about
1773392 listening to him talk i got the impression that the art movie represented a challenge not an opportunity for expression the man is an engineer first and foremost and what gets him excited is solving problems not telling stories

1773414 investing in the new centre is part of the provinces commitment to encourage more nova scotians to live healthy and active lives this resource will be a great legacy of the 2011 canada winter games
1773415 this announcement shows once again our governments support of community infrastructure such as the mainland common centre which is an essential part of healthy canadian cities and towns
1773416 this project will provide an important facility to benefit athletes across the province and canada while generating important economic benefits for the halifax region
1773417 the centre will be the heart of the mainland common serving as a sports destination for hrm and the entire province as well as providing a venue for building a strong closely linked community
1773418 with our federal and provincial funding partners we are very excited to begin construction of the mainland common centre and look forward to enjoying the many benefits it will bring to our region

1773424 we grew up reading comics and really wanted to write something like the books we grew up reading so its a story about real kids with real trouble that have these kinda awkward powers in a world where there arent superheroes i really like it im very proud of it and the fact that weve got any attention on it that people are reading it and reacting to it is really exciting
1773425 after two days of speaking to a half full visitors gallery and congressmen personally leading capitol visitors to sit in the seats on the house floor youd think theyd be running out of things to talk about and losing enthusiasm but thats not the case all tim walberg has to do is reach back into his gas can and hes got plenty of stories to tell about the price of energy this day he starts talking about a voter named beth from the blue collar burg of jackson michigan her family is coughing up 175 a week to pay for gas we can no longer afford to send our kids to catholic school walberg says relaying beths note its gas or dentistry for my son walberg wraps up his speech on the floor of the house invoking shades of his former career as a minister by paraphrasing no less an authority than moses madam speaker let my people vote walberg says to a thunderous standing ovation walberg cedes the floor to another republican congressman ranking house ways and means committee member wally herger who launches into his own passionate oratory about how gas prices are affecting his constituents

1773449 any time we have a story that were covering in an ongoing way we have a discussion around what to cover what time of day it would air
1773450 the question for journalists covering this will be how far should they go how graphic should the description be we can begin to answer that by making the decision in the best interests of our audience how much detail does anyone want or need to understand the story and we need to bear in mind that our audiences could be watching or listening as they eat their breakfast or get ready for the day or while they are eating their dinner or gathering around the television with their families in the evening

1773481 a typical enterprise search deployment would require dozens of servers if you have a scale of 10 million documents with multiple back end databases web servers content servers and all that stuff
1773482 we have done some really core architectural changes to simplify the entire search so the administrators and it departments just need to manage one server to scale the 10 million documents
1773483 with any organization or business entity which has a lot of digital content the main problem for them is they have done some massive investments in content depositories and tools all for the digital content but all that investment is not fruitful until you can find the right document you are looking for
1773484 the effective search is obviously critical in the world of the internet
1773485 theres really astounding growth in the sheer amount of information and documents that companies are storing and attempting to manage successfully
1773486 the more than tripling of capacity on the new appliance isnt simply a matter of bigger better or best its really i think a response to a very serious issue that more and more companies are facing and thats how to efficiently work with and effectively leverage the information that they continue to collect and store
1773487 if it is implemented it will certainly improve things in many parts of the world
1773488 but its premature to say how dramatically things will change in china
1773489 just underscores how important these issues are in relation to the internet
1773490 primarily because the free and open flow of information can have a transformative effect on human rights
1773491 its urgent that the companies recognize their responsibilities for dealing with these issues in an effective way
1773492 the fact theyre sitting down is all to the good but the reality is the agreement is not going to do all the things it needs to do and its important the companies do much more beyond that written agreement
1773493 typically the principle is that you hold people accountable through public disclosure and kick them out of the initiative if theyre not doing the right thing
1773494 weve also been supportive of legislation in congress of things that could be very complementary to a voluntary standard
1773495 this latest agreement about a code of conduct is the result of political pressure
1773496 who knows how voluntary it is we dont think congress should be prohibiting american companies from doing business anywhere economic progress goes hand in hand with political freedom we agree that censorship is deplorable but the companies doing business with china should make the decision on whether its worth it for these companies to do business there
1773497 existing company policy provides that microsoft will block access to windows live spaces content only where we receive a legally binding notice from a government indicating that the material violates local laws or if the content violates our terms of use
1773498 i dont want it to move i like it here

1773500 i didnt know there is more than one hamilton lakes i live in less affluent hamilton hills where nothing is exciting
1773501 if your house is childproof how do they keep getting inside
1773502 let us back inside mom its so hot the driveway melted my crocs
1773503 he was taking us back to my moms house and he was crying
1773504 i dont know if he left for noble reasons or if he realized the mental illness was taking over i never saw him again and all this time i wondered what happened to him
1773505 all these people had a relationship with him and i never even knew him
1773506 on a selfish level it makes me upset and it makes me so sad that hes trying to make his way somewhere
1773507 he was having running conversations with people you couldnt see
1773508 but not so much that he would break the rules thats amazing
1773509 most true homeless are disabled especially mentally they dont hold up a sign
1773510 you could look at it as we didnt mind him being on that bench and that it was acceptable to be homeless
1773511 or that we were nice to never kick him off the bench at an intersection thats rather high dollar real estate its a puzzle i just hope we didnt sell him short
1773512 i think about him more now every day now that i have my own daughter its more poignant for me now
1773513 the whole anger and bitterness thing kind of blew over i just want to see him again
1773514 neither the international association of machinists nor the society of professional engineering employees in america has had a strike during the last 20 years during a period of slow economic growth
1773515 the proposals theyre offering are like those youd see from gm and other companies headed for bankruptcy rather than making record profits
1773516 were more prepared this year for a strike compared to 2005 because people believe its time to make a stand
1773517 if you dont make gains in the good times when will you make them
1773518 iam members are due to take a vote on boeings final offer for their new contract on sept 3 if they reject it a strike could happen at once as occurred during the last round of negotiations in 2005

1773543 i wasnt born in texas but i got here as soon as i
1773544 i think the players froze in that last 20 odd minutes
1773545 i dont know if that was the emotional tension it was the first game of the olympics and everything that goes with that that might have got to them
1773546 i dont try to make excuses for the players but theres certainly something there that we have to get our heads into when we get back to the hotel
1773547 the defending at the free kick wasnt great but that wasnt the key leading to the result in the end

1773551 the hidden purpose of the onslaught on new zealand first is to undermine our democracy
1773552 they are trying to put us away in the vain hope that a certain political party can govern on its own after the election a certain political party with a hidden agenda that keeps popping up out of the shadows
1773553 they want us gone because we oppose foreign ownership because we dont want the lifeblood of new zealand sucked dry by leeches overseas

1773578 global aviation is making a painful adjustment to the new reality of us 100 plus oil cathay pacific is reducing other costs where it can but there is a limit to how much cost can be saved before quality and brand are compromised it is thus inevitable that fares for passengers and shippers will have to rise to reflect the new cost of operation it is difficult to forecast with any degree of accuracy the extent to which these higher fares will reduce demand but thus far it has remained robust despite the current difficulties cathay pacific remains confident in its future hong kong remains asias premier aviation hub and cathay pacifics superb international network affords unrivalled connectivity to and from china the companys priority at this time is to protect the integrity of this network there will be some redeployment of capacity within the network but it is not envisaged that the company will withdraw from any destination it now serves

1773596 there arent any other treatments for depression that have been found to be superior to ect
1773597 we talk about cognitive deficits and memory loss really thats brain damage
1773598 quite frankly the stigma pushes people away from it and it pushes some psychiatrists away from even recommending ect
1773599 but most of the stigma related to ect really is related to misconception
1773600 i thought thats drastic that causes brain damage theres no way i want to do that
1773601 i can remember seeing one person in the waiting room that really looked out of it just like a zombie sort of
1773602 i was just thinking oh god no i dont want to end up like that
1773603 we almost got up and felt like saying no way forget it
1773604 my family and i were told it would cure the depression and it did not
1773605 after holding out all this hope that it would be the final answer it didnt happen i was completely devastated on top of that i had memory loss and on top of that i had cognitive damage
1773606 theres a little bit of gnawing anxiety what if this happens again
1773607 but you do need to attend to long term issues in any way you can medications talk therapy or periodic readministrations of ect
1773608 solving the mystery of how ect works is going to be important for advancements in the field of psychiatry because ect has unparalleled efficacy
1773609 understanding why ect is so much more effective than medications could help the field develop more effective treatments and safer treatments
1773610 it can be considered much earlier than it is for most patients today
1773611 patients suffer with depression either with no response or partial response to antidepressants and for years they limp along with terrible depression
1773612 when i was done with the treatments and the fog started to clear it was like waking up from a bad dream
1773613 after almost ten years i believe the chamber is doing what we intended and hoped it would do when we met to organize they are representing the tourism and hospitality industry in north myrtle beach and helping our small businesses to grow i am proud of our chamber leadership and i look forward to watching the chamber continue being a leader in horry county and south carolina

1773643 the star wars saga introduced a galaxy that has become one of the most distinctive and instantly identifiable in movie history
1773644 our goal was to produce a movie unlike anything else in animation
1773645 but we also had to stay true to star wars to honor everything that george lucas has created thats easier said than done and it took us a long time to figure out exactly how to develop the look style and feel of an animated star wars
1773646 george wanted the characters to live on their own separate from the recognizable actors who portrayed them in the previous films
1773647 to do that we really had to find the essence of the characters and to bring them to life in a way that wasnt just a reproduction of their live action counterparts

1773825 to put oil rigs in the last unfettered american military training range thats out in the eastern gulf of mexico
1773826 well have to wait and see what gates puts out
1773827 maybe gates wants to sort of expand the approach and say ok theres an energy situation and well look at drilling applications on a case by case basis
1773828 and it will give republicans room to run with the ball

1773872 what do you mean spoiling everything for the children theres enough chocolate in this world to go round isnt there
1773873 how can i go around hiding easter eggs when i know at any moment you might come along and steal them stealing is wrong and even a monkey should know that

1773875 i expect that isis didnt invite katie because shes got a nose like a pug
1773876 and even if i did isis has a nose that points upward and that means that shes a snooty nose
1773877 how dare you all me a snooty nose you just said that because i didnt invite you to my party well ill tell you katie why i didnt invite you i didnt want you there because my mum says that your mum is weird and that your whole family is ugly especially you
1773878 because i wouldnt have come anyway and besides your nose does point up and thats because you and your whole family are snooty your family is so snooty that they named you after an egyptian goddess and if you look at a picture of the real isis youll see that she had a pointy up nose too
1773879 at least its not a common name like katie youre more common than a tin of baked beans in fact theres nothing pretty or clever about you youre not even funny youre just dumpy flat nosed katie with stringy black hair bandy legs and wonky teeth and besides nobody likes you because there is nothing special about you at all not one thing apart from the fact that you smell
1773880 in fact who ever did this has an extremely nasty little mind its ever so cruel to make fun of somebody whos had an accident
1773881 look miss look look there it goes the nose is escaping its running away
1773882 what on earth are we going to do about all this nose business the whole school has been traumatized by isiss terrible accident all the children are imagining things its a mass hysteria
1773883 but theres nothing very useful in them unless you want to charm a runaway nose back to its owner i had to learn that spell for the witch masters course at university the professor said it had only been used once and that was 150 years ago in the city of st petersburg when it was still the capital of russia
1773884 none of my friends want to see me anymore not even my nose wants to see me it ran off you know at least you are no longer the most unpopular girl in school i am and i suppose that serves me right for being so mean to you
1773885 you were mean to me but i was meaner to you you see it was me who told your nose to run away
1773886 yes me but now ive brought it back to you
1773887 oh gosh golly golly gosh it is my nose oh pretty little nose why did you run away from me

1773912 the next unsung heroes training will be helping us learn what our stressors are and how to take care of ourselves with our health concerns because it is such a vastly increasing and very strenuous job
1773913 we need to know how to take care of ourselves it is a good benefit to our staff
1773914 its like taking care of your grandmother or your grandfather you do get close its very personal they learn to trust you
1773915 we found out about the effects on caregivers from personal experience with my mother being in the nursing home for ten years where she received loving care
1773916 i have some personal experience with concerns about properly being taken care of in a nursing home with my mother and understanding how difficult it is on employees of nursing homes who go out of there way to be involved and provide proper care
1773917 the training sounded like a great idea and a way the credit union could help out the community i know how important it is
1773918 very hard and a struggle for their families so we deal with the families and some of our staff actually become an extra extended family member for that resident
1773919 the cedar tree institute and the unsung heroes project is helping us at the nursing home deal with our stress and finding out what our triggers are for the stress
1773920 its very high stress for some of them as the different disease processes take over their bodies
1773921 the training assists healthcare workers with the compassionate care of patients and their own stress related issues in a rural health system that is stretched to the breaking point due to shrinking budgets that often dont address additional training needs
1773922 financing for the additional training is not readily available from their own employers due to the economic hard times facing northern michigan due to the highest unemployment and lowest household income in the state
1773923 unsung heroes is a support and renewal training program for nursing home hospice and home health care workers
1773924 physicians nutritionists and psychotherapists work together as a team to provide one of a kind training for the staff who are doing the overlooked real hands on work for the elderly and patients in these care settings
1773925 they teach coping skills and provide spiritual education that the participants use to provide better patient care and an improve relationship with co workers

1773931 while most voters 67 percent say their vote will be based mostly on the candidate at the top of the ticket 30 percent said that the choices of their vice presidential running mates will have a great deal of influence on their decision that s twice the number who said the vp picks would matter in 2000 when george w bush and al gore were preparing their campaigns
1773932 plenty of high profile names are getting bounced around as barack obama s potential running mate
1773933 but speaker of the house nancy pelosi may have a lesser known candidate in mind newsweek and other publications say
1773934 the problem with this formulation is that the people that i spoke from moveon came because they were volunteers whereas the people from the pro drilling groups were paid staffers from groups like the national taxpayers union and dick armeys freedomworks

1773975 at this moment the tibetans inside tibet are brutally and violently being crushed by chinese authorities

1773997 this leaves a lot of questions to be answered sources have said time warner is still talking about deals to merge or sell off its online advertising and internet business does this mean a deal with microsoft or yahoo and if it sees itself as a content company does this mean it could be looking to acquire a tv network or more cable channels
1773998 rumor has it that the dying access business still contributes the lions share of the companys profit meaning that the margin in the content and ad business is very low this will make a big difference in the value time warner could get for the ad business if when it sells it off

1774020 i am afraid of death but even more afraid of wasting my life im afraid of love because it involves things that are beyond our understanding it sheds such a brilliant light but the shadow it casts frightens me

1774041 i think its bullshit i think she got messed up on drugs and that girl who always wears the skinny ties was there when she needed her kinda like a rebound hook up she probably doesnt even know what love means
1774042 she doesnt know what she wants and i dont think it matters whats in between someones legs when it comes to love
1774043 love is love if shes in love with so be it if i had a chance with lindsey i sure as hell wouldnt run away from it because shes slept with men in the past and honestly it doesnt matter what the truth is or what any of us think if the girls in love we all know it can make you stupid

1774066 the mbeki government has been in charge of the situation of eskom having a significant problem of generating supply
1774067 this is to some extent cosatu flexing its muscle and saying to the mbeki government that it will not accept that workers have to bear the cost of their governments failure
1774068 highlighted the ability of cosatu to get support on certain issues particularly around the electricity crisis

1774073 i think its great i think its taken a few years mind you because i think for a while nobody took us seriously but you know our friends in the music business and that obviously did as we went on the more we carried on the more we proved the more we stayed there you know and i think we got the respect from that

1774075 will showcase the bands trademark melodic hard rock sound something the band has amplified from the debut get heavy onto the mega successful the arockalypse
1774076 its definitely going to be different but were not going to go too far on our second album the monsterican dream we went too far lets put it this way the producer of that album pushed the envelope too far we didnt see it until after the fact but he was pushing us in a very metallic direction but the songs didnt fit that direction the songs were in the same genre and style as our first album so they didnt fit the metallic production he gave the album that really alienated a lot of people from us as far as that album was concerned the arrangement and production of an album can change everything you could take a perfectly good song and give it a bad production and itll sound like a bad song if you take the same good song and play it on an acoustic guitar around a campfire or something youll hear it the way it was meant to be heard and go okay i get it now with production it can go either way you never know now we have more of a power element in the music writing as well as on the lyrical side of things of course its going to be a hard rock album thats for sure were trying to take the essence of what we are and how should i say it polish the diamond a little brighter

1774098 they consider iraqis like animals although actually i think they may have more respect for animals we have seen what they do in the streets when theyre not shooting theyre throwing water bottles at people and calling them names if you are terrifying a child or an elderly woman or you are killing an innocent civilian who is riding in his car isnt that terrorism

1774152 the good news for boeing is that it is a genuine opportunity
1774153 at this point it is a fair bet that politicians are going to start meddling in the selection process
1774154 theyre the best experts to predict what theyre going to need to manage their area of operation
1774155 as far as the activity going on here in san diego the agents are needed
1774156 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1774157 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1774158 would have screamed bloody murder if the border patrol had reduced san diego sector staffing levels appreciably
1774159 he said that she had offered him a ride home that they were friends and she had offered him a ride home and she didnt really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle

1774163 if it is implemented it will certainly improve things in many parts of the world
1774164 but its premature to say how dramatically things will change in china
1774165 just underscores how important these issues are in relation to the internet
1774166 primarily because the free and open flow of information can have a transformative effect on human rights
1774167 its urgent that the companies recognize their responsibilities for dealing with these issues in an effective way
1774168 the fact theyre sitting down is all to the good but the reality is the agreement is not going to do all the things it needs to do and its important the companies do much more beyond that written agreement
1774169 typically the principle is that you hold people accountable through public disclosure and kick them out of the initiative if theyre not doing the right thing
1774170 weve also been supportive of legislation in congress of things that could be very complementary to a voluntary standard
1774171 this latest agreement about a code of conduct is the result of political pressure
1774172 who knows how voluntary it is we dont think congress should be prohibiting american companies from doing business anywhere economic progress goes hand in hand with political freedom we agree that censorship is deplorable but the companies doing business with china should make the decision on whether its worth it for these companies to do business there
1774173 existing company policy provides that microsoft will block access to windows live spaces content only where we receive a legally binding notice from a government indicating that the material violates local laws or if the content violates our terms of use
1774174 we made progress in the quarter but were far from satisfied
1774175 were still not in a position to deliver sustained earnings and revenue growth i have said from the beginning that this will take time we expect to make progress over the long term
1774176 we really are focusing on retention and on the acquisition side on quality not quantity
1774177 that said at amp ts was 1 6 percent and verizon the industry leader was 1 1 percent even that marginal improvement leaves them pretty far behind the leaders
1774178 i think the numbers show that their success in migrating those customers to the sprint network has been marginal
1774179 for one thing nextel customers are extremely attached to the directconnect service and its not a trivial cost to migrate an entire work force from iden to sprint plus theyre not inclined to believe a carrier that they feel hasnt treated them as well as theyd like its a tough sales proposition
1774180 we are not mouthpieces we are not gunslingers that do the bidding of someone whose rationale we do not share and whose view of the world
1774181 we feel that the request is beyond what we should be asked to do beyond what our professional ethics allow us to do
1774182 if he is able to come face to face with the little girl thats ethically wrong
1774183 we do not share his theory of the case to the extent we can understand his theory of the case
1774184 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
1774185 i would have the tendency to believe they were telling the truth a little bit more

1774191 the entire industry is transitioning to more efficient vehicles and more fuel saving technologies
1774192 we hope that when congress returns next month they will encourage this transition by providing the necessary funding to assist the hundreds of companies big and small that are working to get this job done
1774193 nows the time for congress to nail the numbers down
1774194 a typical enterprise search deployment would require dozens of servers if you have a scale of 10 million documents with multiple back end databases web servers content servers and all that stuff
1774195 we have done some really core architectural changes to simplify the entire search so the administrators and it departments just need to manage one server to scale the 10 million documents
1774196 with any organization or business entity which has a lot of digital content the main problem for them is they have done some massive investments in content depositories and tools all for the digital content but all that investment is not fruitful until you can find the right document you are looking for
1774197 the effective search is obviously critical in the world of the internet
1774198 theres really astounding growth in the sheer amount of information and documents that companies are storing and attempting to manage successfully
1774199 the more than tripling of capacity on the new appliance isnt simply a matter of bigger better or best its really i think a response to a very serious issue that more and more companies are facing and thats how to efficiently work with and effectively leverage the information that they continue to collect and store

1774202 its unbelievable you just dont expect an electric motorcycle to have this kind of power i ride a lot so when i heard about the zero x i was pretty anxious to get one its pretty cool
1774203 local motorcycle and backyard tracks are being closed because of the noise and pollution made by gasoline engines i built the zero x to enjoy off road riding without the loud engine noise
1774204 we were thrilled when we heard about james dentons interest in the bike at first customers are interested in our motorcycle because its silent and clean after a test ride they are amazed with the extraordinary power and torque that is packed in the lightweight battery unit

1774206 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1774207 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
1774208 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
1774209 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
1774210 wal mart has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
1774211 i just dont have the disposable income i had last year
1774212 i will purchase a new backpack from wal mart with all her school supplies but nothing else will be new at the beginning of the school year

1774222 i would perhaps not admit to losing my nice new bag if it hadnt been found but it was so i will on tuesday morning i set out for a bagel at the bagel deli company 340 15th ave e 201 seattle wa 98112 chose one of the lunch specials the gobbler with no mayonnaise of course i had brought along a book to read as i ate and was carrying it in my tom bihn super ego bag but somehow somehow i forgot i had the bag along with me and left with the book in my hand instead on the way back to the house i stopped for some yogurt bought two of the quite good reasonably priced qfc house brand fruit on the bottom ones and walked about now with the book under my arm a yogurt in each hand still hadnt occurred to me that i could have had a bag along one capable of carrying dozens of yogurts and bunches of books this is called being absent minded if you enjoy euphemisms

1774265 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran and its failure to meet the deadline set by the unscr 1803 the p5 1 are discussing the next steps in the unsc and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another sanction resolution
1774266 we would have preferred a clear yes but it is more complicated than that we do believe that dialogue can continue

1774402 in a soft market the temptation is often to discount heavily and not look closely at what you are getting out of your rooms
1774403 at trump we carefully consider our pricing and products together
1774404 historically cash guests were not regarded as very important to the atlantic city gaming industry
1774405 cash guests are increasingly attractive because they appreciate everything our properties offer they enjoy the shows shopping and our restaurants and clubs growing this segment is one strategy helping us in the softer market this also dovetails with atlantic citys program to market itself as a destination offering more than gaming
1774406 we manage our availability and set rates based on total guest value not just room rate so the right guests always have a room at our properties
1774407 adding these rooms in a soft market has created an opportunity for us to fill the void
1774408 to drive more business we aggressively stepped up marketing efforts and were successful with tv and print media promotions geared toward non gaming customers
1774409 the rainmaker software helps us forecast our cash customer demand independently from our casino business so we can say on any given day what our booking pace is and what our demand appears to be for our cash customers
1774410 we were compiling a considerable amount of data manually to make determinations about forecasted customer demand by customer worth
1774411 our old method of data gathering and forecasting was outdated now we are receiving that information automatically and are able to identify current customer trends more quickly these trends are subsequently compared to year over year performance by calendar date the resulting data enables us to perform accurate forecast modeling to effectively set rates and availability by customer value thus laying the groundwork for revenue optimization of the resort

1774432 a trial that depends on handicapping the defense cant possibly be fair
1774433 the military judge tried at times to mitigate the commissions most unjust rules but the flaws in the system won out
1774434 these trials need to be professional clear and open instead weve got a shambles that brings us no closer to justice
1774435 these trials are not just about a few men and what they may have done they are about the message the united states is sending to the world and that message right now is flat wrong convictions by any means necessary
1774436 the us needs to show it stands for openness and fairness the very values we are fighting for instead we get verdicts rammed down the gullet of justice thats not going to bring anyone over to our side
1774437 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial

1774553 this partnership is the best of both worlds for me and my management team we can keep control of our creative challenges and operations while accelerating our growth doing projects all over the world
1774554 this was a quarter of strong progress against our strategic imperatives especially the significant acceleration of our wireless business
1774555 copes influence is being felt with respect to a greater focus on customer attention
1774556 i dont think anyone really doubted that they could get the wireless business back on track the question is can it be sustained

1774563 it has been more than a year since the housing market went on a tumultuous skid yet the hangover from bad lending practices and tighter credit has housings two primary sponsors fannie mae and freddie mac still unable to step in and fully provide support
1774564 given the likelihood of a prolonged housing slump and the uncertainty of government support investors should remain extremely cautious of lenders like freddie mac or fannie mae
1774565 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements
1774566 we remain committed to raising 5 5 billion dollars of new capital and will evaluate raising capital beyond this amount depending on our needs and as market conditions mandate

1774581 us steel is prepared to co operate with cn towards the goal of closing the transaction in 2008 but it will not agree to extend the deal therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31
1774582 the public interest calls for the stb to complete its review of the transaction and should it be approved to serve a decision that would allow the transaction to close by the end of the year
1774583 this transaction would not simply benefit cn and its customers this transaction is in the broader regional and national interest

1774591 the board of lonmin notes the unsolicited pre conditional offer announced this morning by xstrata for the entire issued share capital of lonmin at 3 300 pence per share in cash

1774843 with the smuggling of arms into lebanon from syria irans involvement and the fact that hezbollah is now a part of the lebanese government there is a need to discuss the situation and formulate policy
1774844 the lebanese cabinet has agreed on fundamental points that show how hezbollahs victory has been effective in this government as the first article is related to the resistance and liberating land this means that there exists an official document that confirms that hezbollah is a force acting in the name of the state to liberate land
1774845 it did not stop the arms transfers from syria to hezbollah
1774846 the right of lebanons people the army and the resistance to liberate all its territories

1774851 in case an israeli warplane was shot down in unifils area of influence the pilot should be rescued as soon as possible and taken to the closest unifil post before any side manages to reach him
1774852 in case the pilot fell into the hands of gunmen he also must be rescued grazzianos order added

1774872 i havent the foggiest clue what you just said and am hoping desperately that i can fake it well enough so that you dont spend the next three days yelling at me

1774882 when i was there a couple of weeks ago they decided that night that they were going to pass a resolution requesting the county to annex college acres into the city
1774883 that was the agreement that those five folks had decided on when the motion failed just to annex
1774884 at last nights meeting they made the motion and it failed due to lack of a second
1774885 my response to him mckibban was well were under a timeline and these people are facing fines and we cant make a resolution because you cant make a decision is the city of el dorado going to pay that fine before you do your job and make a decision
1774886 ive got to give the mayor credit he is so frustrated on this point
1774887 i think a couple of council members realized that by passing this resolution they are truly requiring annexation and they dont want to be the bad guys and pass annexation
1774888 i told them if you guys dont want to do it send it to us well take care of it
1774889 i think we should pass a resolution requesting the city to allow us to hook it up and if annexation is required then do it we need an official something to push them off dead center
1774890 somebodys got to step up and be a governing body because its not happening down the street
1774891 this is exactly what the city of el dorado wants
1774892 they will instigate the fine on the date prescribed then we will have to go to district court and fight them
1774893 now by their inaction they are costing those people additional funds
1774894 who knows what the city is going to do with that then weve done our due diligence
1774895 i would have bet last night they would have approved it
1774896 ive been involved with this a long time and ive never seen the inability to come to a decision like i have with them
1774897 ive been dealing with this thing for a year and a half to two years
1774898 the ideal thing would be they really dont have any grounds to annex those people its really almost an island annexation except for one corner it makes no sense to annex those people with no hope of development
1774899 you the city still make money because they have to pay to connect
1774900 thats the only thing i think ive seen them agree on
1774901 i think we are lighting a fire when we ask them to annex unilaterally
1774902 whereas the city of el dorado has failed on two separate occasions

1774927 if he claims he won i invite him to act with courage and fire one missile or one shell towards the north of israel maybe even to be brave and kidnap one israeli soldier if he does this the gates of hell will open before him
1774928 the lebanese people rejoiced in welcoming the senior prisoner samir kuntar and his friends but hizbullahs hyperbolic propaganda had a political agenda beyond the release of the prisoners
1774929 the release of prisoners is a grand thing but in releasing a few prisoners from israel the homeland itself has been taken captive by hizbullah and
1774930 if the homeland moves a little towards its own national interests in a way that does not suit hizbullah it will pay a hefty price as it did in july of 2006 and may of 2008
1774931 when those weapons were aimed towards israel i was proud but now i feel that these weapons are aimed at the foundations of the country that has submitted to them

1774935 if the shareholders of nozala do not apply for these shares we will have to cut back on the number of shares that had been made available to them
1774936 we believe that as the masonge scheme will only be open to individuals the benefits of the share ownership will be widespread and will attract new participants to the market where they can learn more about the principles of investing in the market participants will have full voting rights over african bank shares held by masonge
1774937 this means you do not have to put down a full amount when you buy them

1774951 lifes colors wildlife art by gayle clayborn and photography by dr richard kuhns
1774952 kuhns photography is very beautiful and gayles work featuring animals is extraordinary
1774953 the eyes in clayborns work are especially beautiful its like they are looking right at you
1774954 we heard that kuhns was an excellent photographer and gayle has exhibited here before with a group from wichita
1774955 art has always been one of my favorite things to do
1774956 art is something you can lose yourself in either by doing your own art or looking at someone elses art
1774957 photography is the only medium available to artists that both stops time and captures light in as much as a thousandth of a second
1774958 that particular image has never been available before and will never be available again yet as an artist it is my privilege to capture that moments beauty for others to enjoy
1774959 this then is the philosophy behind my art it is an attempt to capture the wonder of the world around us and its interaction with mankind time arrested light captured the natural world revealed
1774960 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1774961 we fully intend to move forward with additional prosecutions on the 20 other cases that are currently in the military commission system
1774962 this military commission finds you on charge number one conspiracy not guilty of charge two material support for terrorism guilty
1774963 is material support a war crime the defence believes it is not
1774964 a good outcome for the government in arguing that this was a fair trial
1774965 the fourth factor the ability of the defence to mount a full defence is where the criticism of the process likely will be levied
1774966 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate
1774967 with habitats under increasing threat conservation seed banking is an important strategy for both storing and understanding genetically important wild seeds
1774968 this experiment could lead to some ground breaking research by providing a preliminary evaluation of space station seed banking a possible option for the future
1774969 an insurance policy for the world could be to have some seeds up in space as well
1774970 one of the things that has been reported from china is that the radiation has led to giant vegetables and changes in the genetic structure
1774971 our hypothesis is that the trip in space for six months wont have any major impact on these very tough resilient seeds
1774972 they might be the sort of things we would take up into space not only for food but also if were looking at producing oxygen in space or setting up micro climates

1774984 you just gave away the farm by citing nicaea you have effectively betrayed sola scriptura
1774985 if a catholic holds trents conclusions to be important because they represent the teaching of the church which jesus christ himself founded
1774986 but what i cant understand is your inability or refusal to actually ponder it for a second for the sake of the argument
1774987 but that is exactly the comfort the catholic takes in the situation
1774988 where will we go you have the words of eternal life
1774989 why are the decrees of westminster more acceptable or binding on the reformed than the degrees of trent it seems to me this distinction says everything they are more acceptable and more binding because the reformed christian finds them to be more biblical according to his own interpretation of scripture
1774990 aha so you admit that you think westminster is more biblical than trent
1774991 aha so you catholics do accept the authority of your church unquestioningly
1774992 then you dont have to have any more you have a nice little family then
1774993 naivete and self righteousness combined are dangerous add to these the curse of an unteachable spirit and failure is certain
1774994 i learned the languages of the world and the machines from my father

1774997 name your feelings treat them as friends be ready to meet new ones and to disassociate with the old ones when they can no longer match your pace
1774998 its extremely exciting to be so close to the known location of the theatre and then find remains that look to be associated with it

1775000 we can now start to work on the detail of what the building here might have looked like and expand our knowledge of the playhouses of elizabethan london

1775017 beatty has a wonderful ear for voice especially the voices of children and the characters she constructs through annes skewed perception are funny and heartbreaking by turns but what is really impressive is how she weaves her human comedy with the most powerful nature writing in pollard beatty beautifully conveys the loneliness and the ecstasy of an unknowable character and the charged complex presence of the natural world around us both are too often only in our peripheral vision she looks at them directly this novel heralds an exceptional talent
1775018 like nicola barker who she occasionally recalls beatty is drawn to the margins of society and to the misfits who congregate there pollard is the precise opposite of escapist literature because it gives the reader back the world
1775019 the storytelling is masterful and the language magical the luminous life of lilly aphrodite is a rich book in both its prose and in the strength of its characters whose lives cross in the chaos of war and its brief glittering aftermath
1775020 captivating beatrice colins irresistible novel the glimmer palace follows the eventful life of a berlin orphan who becomes a rising star in the brand new medium of the cinema 20th century berlin is just like colins engaging main character anything it wants to be and full of promise to be more this is colins third novel and with a plot and setting so captivating we can only hope it draws more notice than her first two
1775021 heheh do you have a ticker for the end of the year
1775022 i and the vast majority of the british public are not chinese
1775023 our new estimate shows that the epidemic is and has been worse than we previously knew
1775024 so thats the scary part the highest rate of newly hiv patients
1775025 we have new patients every single day in the clinic
1775026 were doing a better job at diagnosing people its not that the numbers are more than before
1775027 alarming enough that we see at least ten per day new cases
1775028 we still see people who have never heard of hiv and aids in 2008
1775029 this is something that is very true in my clinical experience
1775030 the uninsured cant get in to see the doctor they miss medications their blood pressure is out of control and really you see devastating consequences
1775031 these people are going to end up with complications of their illnesses prematurely they will be disabled early they will probably die younger it is a major public health disaster
1775032 longer term there will be expensive admissions to hospitals usually through the emergency department due to diabetes out of control and congestive heart failure because of hypertension
1775033 we found some pretty striking differences when we compared uninsured individuals with one of these seven conditions with insured individuals with one of the conditions
1775034 these are conditions that we take care of in the clinic we know that we can prevent disabling complications or catastrophe if we are able to manage these conditions
1775035 it is interesting that chronic conditions are more common among people with insurance than without but that isnt surprising either people with a chronic condition are likely to place a higher value on their coverage and work harder to get and keep it
1775036 but having insurance is not likely to prove to be a panacea for these folks
1775037 people with chronic conditions who are insured are not doing so well either we do not do a very good job of delivering chronic care in this country for anyone
1775038 atomic bombing was justified as a stimulus to end the war
1775039 mechanized civilization has just reached the ultimate stage of barbarism in a near future we will have to choose between mass suicide and intelligent use of scientific conquests this can no longer be simply a prayer it must become an order which goes upward from the peoples to the governments an order to make a definitive choice between hell and reason

1775057 its a scheme that ranged from street operatives to the ceo of a hospital
1775058 scheme to defraud the medi cal and medicare programs out of millions of dollars
1775059 within the past four years hundreds if not thousands of other homeless persons in skid row have been recruited hospitalized treated and discharged in a manner substantially similar as part of a long running scheme to bilk the medicare and medi cal programs out of millions of dollars by causing unnecessary hospitalization for paid recruits
1775060 today we are sending the message that those who would seek to defraud our healthcare system and those who would callously exploit mentally impaired and drug addicted homeless men and women to turn a profit will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law
1775061 these criminals thought they could get away with this scheme because they figured no one cares about the homeless on skid row they were dead wrong

1775140 this has been described as the most valuable domestic burglary ever committed in this country the collection is described as priceless
1775141 there is a difficulty in putting a value on antiques and antiquities some of them very precious and very rare but it is tens of millions of pounds
1775142 this must be one of the most serious examples of conspiracy to burgle ever to come before the court considering the amounts involved

1775145 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1775146 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1775147 we now have an inkling of just how deep in the mud mccain and his people are willing to wallow in order to win in november right up to their republican eyeballs
1775148 they put out this ad and were running this ad and were talking about it which from their point of view actually works for them
1775149 they work and they always work and we always go through this little dance when everybody says im a different kind of politician im post partisan im a maverick and of course when it comes right down to it you need to drive the other guys numbers down if anything they havent gone negative enough just yet

1775157 the number of men applying for primary school training courses is increasing
1775158 some boys can grow up to the age of 11 without a male role model because there are so few men in early years education and i think it has a huge social impact
1775159 the thing that is funny from my point of view and its always a mystery to me is that everyone knows that a tomato is a fruit but they dont know that a squash or a string bean or a cuke cucumber is also a fruit

1775354 i have always thought that the congestion charge is a blunt instrument it has proved successful in cutting traffic coming into london but on its own has not resolved the problem of congestion various works and schemes going on in the capital have also eroded its impact i am therefore introducing a more comprehensive approach to easing congestion in london
1775355 congestion would be a lot worse were it not for the charge
1775356 tfl needs to manage the roadworks better which is plainly possible traffic lights can also be rephased by giving less green time to pedestrians and more to traffic
1775357 without the congestion charge the traffic problems in london would be much worse however as a result of other interventions such as utility and construction works the reduction in road space has had a detrimental impact on congestion levels and is slowing traffic down

1775425 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
1775426 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it

1775428 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not

1775430 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be

1775478 dells success in meeting its carbon neutral goal in less than a year is impressive and should serve as a model for other u s companies to follow

1775499 until one is committed there is hesitancy the chance to draw back concerning all acts of initiative and creation there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans that the moment one definitely commits oneself then providence moves too all sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred a whole stream of events issues from the decision raising in ones favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would have come his way whatever you can do or dream you can do begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
1775500 taking time to talk with and listen to children about the upcoming school year is one of the best ways parents can help them make the transition to school life
1775501 it sounds like youre kind of worried about this next year
1775502 for preschoolers and kindergartners who are anxious about going to school for the first time parent should try some desensitization
1775503 its called bibliotherapy reading books for the purpose of helping to get into their minds the social story about what can be expected
1775504 there even are some lovely books about kids who goof up
1775505 teachers are pretty skilled at helping children make a good transition
1775506 teachers are the ones who should decide how long the parent remains usually when the parent leaves the crying stops quickly
1775507 if there were some trials from the prior year rather than encouraging negative thinking talk about how it will be a new teacher a new set of things to learn and likely new friends
1775508 if a child has an extreme dread of school have specialists evaluate the child for learning disabilities family issues or other potential causes
1775509 if its more like i hate school because its not as fun as summer talk about some of the positive things about schools
1775510 when theyre active and feel connected to their school they have another reason to do better
1775511 and if theyre on a sports team they have to keep good grades
1775512 young adolescents especially ones entering middle school probably really need to be ready to be organized
1775513 tell the child you know i didnt like school work but i did it because it was a means to an end
1775514 offer to be there for your children if it means going along for the first day at middle school or simply helping them with schoolwork i can see teens feeling a wonderful sense of hope to know that their parent is available
1775515 even though they may find it painful that they only get cs you have to respect them for their integrity and their effort
1775516 we want to show the world that change is possible and highlighting the selfless work these individuals are doing to rid the world of slavery is a great place to start

1775526 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1775527 apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
1775528 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1775529 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1775530 capitalizing on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences

1775666 i am most concerned by the execution of mexican national jos medellin yesterday in texas mr medellin was not informed of his right to consular help at the time of his arrest even though the united states are legally bound to guarantee this right under the 1963 vienna convention on consular relations this is a regrettable attitude by a country which is very vocal about its commitment to the rule of law the judicial authorities also blatantly ignored the order by the international court of justice to stay the execution on the grounds of the violation of the right to consular assistance i wrote to the texas board of pardons and paroles in july asking for a stay of the execution but my appeal has been disregarded in the same way as the calls from the mexican government the un secretary general and several other governments and international organisations the issue at stake is not the guilt of mr medellin he was found guilty of a particularly gruesome crime and he deserved to be punished the problem is the death penalty which is rejected by a great majority of democratic and civilised countries across the world and also the pick and choose attitude of the united states of america and its individual states when it comes to respecting international law the execution of mr medellin was therefore not only a violation of human rights and human dignity but also an act of arrogant defiance which undermines the collective mechanisms for peace and security in the world

1775758 programs will shed light on the canal economic activities in iraq and the region in addition to following up the reconstruction of iraq in kurdistan center and south
1775759 preparations to launch the channel began six months ago however will begin broadcasting from bahrain in the first of next september
1775760 were willing to be the baghdad headquarters of the broadcasting but security conditions have prevented it in the hope that it will be broadcasting from baghdad until the situation improves completely
1775761 the channel will not be directed only to iraq and to cover its activities exclusively but would cover arab countries and the middle east in full
1775762 third channel of its kind in the arab states and the first in iraq
1775763 priority will be investment activity in general and banks and trading companies and import and export activity and the movement of capital market and the oil sector transportation agriculture
1775764 an agreement with the iraqi government to declare some of the tenders for themselves across the channel
1775765 intention to transform the channel into a shareholding company and offer shares for subscription future
1775766 the board of directors of the station operates from the city of arbil and currently lead while the alleged iraqi journalist abbas full management channel from its position in bahrain and the cadre who will work where it will be iraq lebanon jordan and other arab states and foreign

1775774 actually james wouldnt mis speaking under oath in front of a jury in federal court be a nice way of saying perjury
1775775 im likely wrong because i think perjury needs intent as well as falsehood but it would certainly be fun to see them brought up on charges
1775776 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
1775777 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

1775779 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
1775780 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
1775781 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
1775782 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
1775783 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
1775784 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
1775785 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
1775786 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
1775787 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
1775788 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
1775789 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
1775790 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
1775791 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
1775792 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
1775793 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

1775799 steer around your weaknesses and focus on your strengths successful people dont try too hard to improve what theyre bad at they capitalize on what theyre good at
1775800 thats why intrinsic motivation is so important doing things not to get an external reward like money or promotion but because you simply like doing it the more intrinsic motivation you have the more likely you are to persist the more you persist the more likely you are to succeed
1775801 i cannot give you the formula for success but i can give you the formula for failure which is to try to please everybody

1775838 as the journalists were slapping high scores on the new wines i retreated to my older collection every time i drank an old barolo i was overwhelmed with remorse there was the italian in me why change such a perfect thing what could i do to make sure these guys who followed the old way these holdouts didnt disappear altogether
1775839 there were bad wines and great wines not right wines and wrong wines what you liked was in large part a question of taste a complex concept generally agreed upon to be a reflection of personal preference and part of tasting and understanding wine involved being open to the idea that some wine requires patience and work and is not instantly gratifying

1775882 anyone who knows me will tell you that ive always had a healthy sense of my abilities i tend to say what im thinking and what i believe i dont have much patience for incompetence these are traits that have served me well but there are times believe it or not when ive come across as arrogant and tactless

1775886 jai was a bit shocked were really going to drive around in dented cars she asked well you cant have just some of me jai i told her you appreciate the part of me that didnt get angry because two things we own got hurt but the flip side of that is my belief that you dont repair things if they still do what they are supposed to do the cars still work lets just drive em ok maybe this makes me quirky not everything needs to be fixed

1775905 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1775906 theres potential promise that vitamin c is part of the armamentarium for treating some cancers
1775907 which ones weve got to do more and find out
1775908 the body wants to get to a certain place and no more
1775909 short circuiting the bodys normal control mechanisms and finding theres an unexpected surprise that may be beneficial
1775910 should patients with any kind of tumor go out and get iv ascorbate vitamin c thats not the message here
1775911 like so many things that are intriguing or appear to be promising there appears to be a long way to go from the theory in the lab to the practical application in the clinic
1775912 in the short term nevirapine is better than nothing but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1775913 the study reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance
1775914 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1775915 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1775916 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1775917 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1775918 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community centers
1775919 the use of a single one size fits all value for the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 obscures important differences associated with transmission cofactors perhaps more importantly the particular value of 0001 i e one infection per 1000 contacts between infected and uninfected individuals that is commonly used seems to represent a lower bound as such this value substantially underestimates the infectivity of hiv 1 in many heterosexual contexts heterosexual infectivity can exceed 01 one transmission per 10 contacts for penile vaginal contact or even 03 one transmission per three contacts for penile anal contact claims in both the popular media and the peer reviewed literature that hiv is very difficult to transmit heterosexually are dangerous in any context where the possibility of hiv exposure exists
1775920 improved infectivity estimates especially more detailed estimates that quantify the amplifying effects of biological cofactors will help us to grasp the magnitude of the hiv epidemic accurately communicate the level of risk involved in heterosexual sex and identify the best possible intervention strategies for slowing the epidemics spread
1775921 infectivity studies are very difficult to conduct and that few studies exist as a result many of the studies producing the published estimates suffered from at least one potential bias therefore while our study documents the considerable heterogeneity of the heterosexual infectivity of hiv 1 and provides some explanations for this heterogeneity considerable uncertainty remains
1775922 many of the investigators including myself were surprised by the results
1775923 were continually researching new treatments but sometimes the tried and true methods are still the best course these findings substantiate the importance of laser treatment in the management of diabetic macular edema
1775924 mothers of young children in the united states are in a rather untenable situation
1775925 mothers are so isolated in our society there is not an appreciation for the extent to which this is a very challenging time for this large population
1775926 we were surprised at how quickly the women were back to employment over 80 percent by 12 weeks postpartum
1775927 they didnt get the maternity leave that they wanted they felt they had to be back at work earlier than they wanted they werent able to achieve their
1775928 they are trying to do the right thing but they are not getting the support they need in terms of time to recover and the financial support they need to be at home with their babies
1775929 there is a major awareness challenge we arent really aware of the situation that mothers are in
1775930 we need to extend the supports we have offered to mothers we need to build awareness among women that they are not alone these are common issues issues for which they can get help they are entitled to help
1775931 most women dont exist within extended families and need other forms of support because there is not an extended family that can pick up the extra responsibility
1775932 that would be very helpful in reducing the level of
1775933 with all the emphasis on appropriate parenting there is pressure on women to be 100 percent available which is simply not possible womens expectations have increased dramatically
1775934 especially when there is a disconnect between how one thinks a mother is supposed to behave and how grueling it actually is that sets up people for disappointment and feelings of inadequacy it does create stress

1775937 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1775938 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace

1775945 dads appointment as aub president marked the fulfilment of his inherited values and came at a time when the map of the middle east was not only still transforming but crying out in full protest at its constant redrawing over centuries from the input of outsiders with outsiders interests

1775971 the undocumented claim that all chattels in the home belong entirely to mrs petricevic is not particularly plausible in a context where activity of this sort has occurred the courts must be astute to protect creditors against what could well be gaming behaviour

1776192 salve sono steven spielberg in molti ormai mi considerano bollito perch tutti i miei ultimi film con gli alieni sono stati un flop ma io dimostrer di essere ancora in carreggiata girando un nuovo fantastico film con indiana jones e gli alieni
1776193 ma ha quasi settantanni non sar mai credibile come avventuroso archeologo ammazzanazisti
1776194 signor spielberg maestro come cattivo ci hanno dato cate blanchett
1776195 perfetto infilatela in una tutona da metalmeccanico mettetele addosso un osceno parrucchino nero e fatela parlare con accento russo far la temibile cocca di stalin
1776196 ecco maestro in realt la signora blanchett dice che si sente ridicola dice che ha una dignit artistica da difendere
1776197 niente discussioni anzi gi che ci siete datele un cinturone e attaccateci uno spadino da moschettiere
1776198 signor spielberg il signor connery si rifiutato di girare questo film
1776199 e facciamo che indiana parler della sua morte per tutto il film aspetta che lo veda quello scozzese rinsecchito gli cascheranno tutti i capelli per laccidente
1776200 non ce ne sono signor spielberg abbiamo esaurito il budget nel tentativo di far sembrare ford un po pi giovane

1776203 semplice lo infileremo dentro un frigorifero che schizzer in aria e rotoler per decine e decine di chilometri poi indiana uscir illeso con ancora il cappello sulla testa
1776204 signor spielberg questa una delle scene pi lunghe e importanti del film e
1776205 bene allora la scazzottata sui gipponi in corsa la mettiamo qui
1776206 s cos insegnano al figlio di indiana jones ad andare sulle liane

1776208 ma maestro non abbiamo nessuno che possa fare il figlio di indiana jones
1776209 signore ecco io non vorrei essere invadente ma precisamente come pensa di far finire il film
1776210 ma evidente arrivano gli alieni ammazzano i comunisti e poi se ne vanno sulla loro piramide maya che in realt era una gigantesca astronave

1776382 we lost ground on clint bowyer and carl edwards even though we had a decent finish last weekend in montreal we still have a number of races to go and i think weve got a decent shot at getting up there and battling for the lead as we close out the year

1776409 bristol has a lot of history and we hope to have a great experience there and put our huge amount of testing into good use for chad
1776410 during my off time from the asalms we have been competing in our outlaw car at spartan where hes sixth in points despite missing several races early in the season and we also ran a super pro race at home and that was really fun
1776411 im really looking forward to returning back to the asalms with what the team and i have learned from chas howe and everybody up there at howe racing and from all of our tests weve been running
1776412 i have really high hopes and expectations going into bristol i know just to make the field will be tough so we will chomp at the bit in practice to get up to speed for the race
1776413 it will be awesome to race at such a historic and fast race track and will definitely be a change of pace from what i have been in for the past month and a half
1776414 well be happy with a solid run and to come home in one piece that would be a big step and boost of confidence that we really need to get ready for this three week stint of asalms racing that we are about to do but im just really excited to be back and race some of the best short track aces in the country

1776451 it would take at least a decade for oil companies to obtain permits procure equipment and do the exploration necessary to get the oil out of the ground most industry analysts say
1776452 this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes it is a problem we will not solve in the next few years and it is likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century we must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and grandchildren we simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources by acting now we can control our future instead of letting the future control us the most important thing about these proposals is that the alternative may be a national catastrophe further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation he called the new energy policy he was proposing t he moral equivalent of war except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not destroy

1776470 for many chinese the games are almost seen as a sacred ritual
1776471 whats going on in china far surpasses the importance other countries placed on their games

1776473 were not used to being underdogs in the olympic games but well get used to that
1776474 people doing business in china can feel and see the countrys rise but many americans dont really understand whats going on
1776475 these games could show them what a lot of us are already seeing

1776481 horses are supposed to be protected if people dont pay attention before they know it there are not going to be any wild horses and i think thatll be a great loss
1776482 the bottom line is weve run out of things to do with these animals
1776483 there are pros and cons to each method but were not at that point
1776484 the potential for wholesale killing of thousands of healthy wild horses marks a complete turnaround in management policy
1776485 living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the west
1776486 to set the record straight euthanasia is mercy killing thats certainly not whats being proposed here by any stretch of the imagination
1776487 its killing pure and simple to balance the books for an agency whose reckless management has caused immeasurable harm to a national treasure
1776488 is a long standing concern and must not be used as a death sentence
1776489 what its going to take is a public outcry to hopefully reverse that kind of thinking people need to contact their legislators
1776490 theres a certain social pressure that goes along with it

1776516 my fellow elders chief servants and protectors of the throne and comrades in arms in the service of our lord almighty it is my honor and my privilege to introduce to you the heir to our throne the acting king and defender of the faith his majesty prince william brasky ii of the brasky monarchs
1776517 now i believe were all aware of why youve been summoned but just to summarize there have been several calamities lately both internally and internationally which may or may not be supernatural in nature these all seem to stem from the potential armed conflict between our country and the united states of america and there has been talk recently among even our inner circles of the trial by styx the prophecy which seems to depict the end of the kingdom
1776518 the recent absence of the prophecy itself seems to confirm these superstitious scenarios frankly there are a lot of what ifs some tall tales surrounding the disappearance of the styx prophecy what i want to know is what you all know
1776519 there are several factions among us all probing several different scenarios the first seems the most obvious one where the disappearance of the prophecy we have probed for so many centuries heralds the beginning of the inevitable end or frighteningly enough a scenario where the kingdom has already reached its end and there is no longer any need for the prophecy another sect contends that the prophecy has been somehow absconded spirited away by an earthbound creature a spirit a fiend or some force beyond our real understanding due to the actions of those currently or at least recently in power as some sort of punishment for the escalation of tensions abroad the economic crises or something to that effect of course the presence of such a scenario brings up a third possible sect
1776520 the disappearance of every single copy of the prophecy as known much less the erasure and blank out of every single copy would require a considerable amount of resources and ingenuity
1776521 regardless theres no denying the fact that public discontent has reached an all time high and there is every possibility of a conspiracy to undermine if not overthrow the government with your permission your majesty i would thoroughly recommend looking into this matter as much as any of the otherworldly scenarios as would most of my colleagues here
1776522 if not somewhat enlightening however before we go any further i think i should introduce you to a new friend of mine
1776523 the reason ive brought her in is because she has claimed to have witnessed the demon of styx first hand
1776524 i figured you might know a thing or two about this
1776525 the demons power was sealed away by that great thief
1776526 the thief of thoughts and words and because of that we were able to escape the stick mans spell
1776527 but with all due respect what does this have to do with the prophecies are they simply negated now
1776528 for the time being that would seem to be the case
1776529 whatever plans that stick man had they were undone or at least brought to some conclusion the moment he was sealed away for now possibly forever or at least for the foreseeable future the demon of styx is now no longer a threat to our kingdom
1776530 one of the things that really characterizes web 2 0 is the high interactivity between the user and other users as well as the application in sharing information
1776531 these little microapplications like google gadgets are ideal for that on the other hand if someone creates a gadget that is designed to trick the user thats easy to do

1776856 the bottom line is you cant lump all terrorists together what the tamil tigers are fighting for in sri lanka or the basque separatists in spain or the insurgents in al anbar province may only be connected by tactics
1776857 do you think that the terrorists hate us for our freedoms or do you think they have specific geopolitical objectives
1776858 well i believe that terrorism is a tool that has been utilized throughout history to achieve certain objectives some have been ideological others territorial there are personality driven terroristic objectives
1776859 the bottom line is you cant lump all terrorists together and i think weve got to do a much better job of clarifying what are the motivations the raisons d tre of terrorists
1776860 i mean what the tamil tigers are fighting for in sri lanka or the basque separatists in spain or the insurgents in al anbar province may only be connected by tactics they may not share all that much in terms of what is the philosophical or ideological underpinning
1776861 we are not satisfied that japan is using its influence at all to bring about an end to the military confrontation or in the evolution of an acceptable political solution bearing in mind the long standing suffering and legitimate aspirations of the tamil people
1776862 none of the southern parties are ready to accept the core principles for a lasting peace the tamil homeland the tamil nation and the tamil right to self determination the ruling party is adamant on unitary rule the red and yellow parties are calling for no solution at all and the main opposition party somersaulting from its earlier position is on the one hand saying nothing concrete and using evasive language to support the military actions of the government and on the other hand saying it supports peace efforts all this clearly clarifies our point and proves beyond doubt that all the sinhala political parties are essen tially chauvinistic and anti tamil to expect a political solution from any of these southern parties is political naivety

1776871 in the coming days its going to be interesting watching this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1776872 a few days ago somebody asked me what they could do personally to help america save energy so i said something that some of you heard which is all of us we could get better gas mileage and save oil in the process just by keeping our tires inflated turns out the experts agreed turns out that we can save 3 4 on our total oil consumption just by keeping our cars tuned up and inflating our tires
1776873 mccain and the republican national committee though mocked the idea and they went around sending tire gauges to reporters saying barack obamas energy plan well you know that sounded clever except last night after all that senator mccain actually said that he agreed that keeping our tires inflated was a good idea which makes sense because it turns out nascar which knows something about tires apparently said the same thing so did the triple a so in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1776874 could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1776875 yesterday he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so so i believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution
1776876 my theory is that obamas right in that theres a debate going on there its about what tactics the candidate is comfortable using
1776877 so we complain about the sad state of affairs our country is in namely our domestic and international economic woes but cannot shake our overdependence on hate and adulation
1776878 this is the deadly waste that senator mccain will be creating with his planned 45 nuke plants
1776879 it was only this week that he started to try to include more specifics
1776880 and by the way air is not free anymore it cost 75 cents or a dollar at most stations
1776881 i have kept up regular tire pressure checks twice weekly since and my milage is right on all the time so stick that info where your conservative sun dont shine
1776882 obama did not say inflating your tires was a substitute for drilling
1776883 he said the amount of oil that consumers could conserve could yield as much as off shore drilling
1776884 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1776885 well if you can pretend that that is the entirety of obamas plan i can pretend that it isnt in mccains plan cant i
1776886 believe that mccain is not for saving energy and reducing consumption
1776887 in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain

1776934 i am starting to question the wisdom of supporting this plan
1776935 this is really a surprise because i didnt think it was going to be such a big deal
1776936 why we wore the masks is simple pollution when you train your whole life for something dot all your is and cross all your ts why wouldnt you be better safe than sorry
1776937 they told us that the chinese were mad and that this is a politically charged issue but we didnt mean to offend anybody
1776938 when they handed us these masks they never said here they are but dont wear them
1776939 its disappointing because i was under the assumption that the mask was approved for use because it was issued by the u s o c
1776940 in the coming days its going to be interesting watching this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1776941 in which 66 of the voting age population is overweight and 32 is obese could sen obamas skinniness be a liability despite his visits to waffle houses ice cream parlors and greasy spoon diners around the country his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
1776942 when skinny means black in fact is the name of the column by tim noah which notes that a
1776943 the sad fact is that any discussion of obamas physical appearance is going to remind white people of the physical characteristic thats most on their minds better either to leave the whole topic alone it seems to me or to address the question of racial prejudice head on in the future the press would be wise to avoid discussing how ordinary americans will respond to the size of obamas ears the thickness of obamas eyebrows and so on
1776944 what theyre going to try is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
1776945 i got a lot of phone calls i got a lot of messages on my cell phone theres a lot of speculation out there

1776981 the third one would be facing your destiny if such a thing exists and making the ultimate decision
1776982 the problem is what del toros talked about to me is that hellboy iii would be the end of hellboy
1776983 and heres where we have the big conflict my version of hellboy in the comics is a finite story but its going to take me 15 years to get to the ending if he makes hellboy iii and its the death of hellboy im left doing the comic going but im not done yet
1776984 my hellboy is going to die but i want to be the one who does that and if del toro does my ending there wont be a lot of surprise when i get to the end of the comic
1776985 we havent spent a lot of time talking about what his version of the story would be
1776986 and i dont spend a lot of time thinking about that one
1776987 i cant help but think hes coming to the conclusion of the story
1776988 there are so many questions about how it might happen
1776989 and i hear ideas how it might be done but i have no idea how it would happen it would be nice to strike while the iron is hot but i dont know how that would be done
1776990 that will be between me del toro and my therapist
1776991 im still raising hellboy im not done with the character yet

1776999 i just absolutely wouldnt even fathom the idea of performing in front of people
1777000 it wasnt even something i did do for a long time it was that traumatic
1777001 i wasnt used to singing solo in front of so many people
1777002 when she was done i found it to be very interesting
1777003 i suggested that if she ever wanted to contemporize this music and do something with it in a bigger production that we should talk about it
1777004 they would know the song we were singing look at the translation and see that is what they say in church in english
1777005 this led to many wonderful conversations the level of energy that existed in the room at these sessions was very profound
1777006 its very appropriate for her to submit what weve done
1777007 it was one of the most difficult and intense things ive ever done im proud of the cd and thats not something ive been comfortable saying
1777008 it went really well i had some performance anxiety beforehand but it just wasnt an issue it was wonderful for me to see that there is some healing going on
1777009 of an ignorant american eating a century egg and telling you it is totallly disgusting
1777010 the abalone makes this amazing material out of a common mineral
1777011 suddenly i wondered what if we could assemble materials like the abalone does but not be limited to one element what if we could bond protein to other elements in the periodic table and grow new materials
1777012 the creature in question is polypterus senegalus a fish whose family tree can be traced back 96 million years and who still inhabits muddy freshwater pools in africa
1777013 design of the p senegalus armor kept the crack localized by forcing it to run in a circle around the penetration site rather than spreading through the entire scale and leading to catastrophic failure like many ceramic materials
1777014 they usually find about 20 different options within about 100 square kilometers and about
1777015 mine doesnt go all the way around it was supposed to but they messed up my friend drew out a design
1777016 let me finish the story for you he sketched out a design which would wrap around my arm twice but your arm was too big for it
1777017 oh look you have an adorable dolphin on your leg
1777018 well yes the room is yellow and there are flowers and polka dots on the blankets but thats just the way things are when you stay at the beach
1777019 training camp is just a laboratory of emotions its so raw
1777020 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
1777021 if im asked for my views as a theologian rather than a church leader i have to be honest and admit that they are as ive said
1777022 sea cucumbers can rapidly alter the stiffness of their skin in response to environmental cues inspired by these creatures polymer scientists at case western reserve university in cleveland have mimicked this trick in an artificial system
1777023 elegantly reproduce an inherently complex natural phenomenon with straightforward polymer science
1777024 the exact imitation of biological structures by using equivalent processes to those used in nature is extremely difficult since the mechanisms of formation of biological structures are tremendously complex
1777025 an alternative approach to fabricate replicas of biological shapes is based on converting templates harvested from a particular species to inorganic materials this approach could result in a highly reproducible and inexpensive process for the fabrication of complex nanostructures with unique functionalities this way structures can be made out of more stable harder and high temperature tolerable inorganic materials
1777026 many structures have evolved in nature to display interesting and useful properties the most appealing of these properties are optical imparting either coloration and or camouflage to the organism optical imaging structures such as compound eyes or polarization sensitive eyes are also attractive some of these structures may have properties in the infrared regime and therefore may not be easily appreciated by casual human observers if we could replicate easily these and other attractive features eg superhydrophobicity of ciliated objects such as lotus leaves we could exploit them for various technical or scientific purposes
1777027 after two and a half years of research and 6 5 million in funding by the eus sixth framework programme for research sensopac scientists have designed and tested a human like arm with a dextrous and sensitive hand controlled by a computer program inspired by the human cerebellum
1777028 various readers complain about henkes reliance on alexa com ratings thats a fair criticism to a degree the numbers are based on the rather thin network of people whove downloaded the alexa toolbar to their browsers if even a few dozen instapundit readers added the alexa toolbar it would probably produce a noticeable upswing in the rankings of instapundit and the blogs i link to

1777030 we may even throw in some tenacious d for good measure
1777031 therefore prepare your minds for action be self controlled set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when jesus christ is revealed
1777032 but in your hearts set apart christ as lord always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have but do this with gentleness and respect keeping a clear conscience so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in christ may be ashamed of their slander
1777033 the end of all things is near therefore be clear minded and self controlled so that you can pray
1777034 be self controlled and alert your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour
1777035 our issue remains with the secret service agent who intervened his actions are still a problem

1777043 obviously someone who is an opponent of the national party has made secret recordings of personal conversations and i dont think you have to be sherlock holmes to go away and work out who that might be and what their motivations are
1777044 we know labour party activists tried to infiltrate our conference we know weve ejected a few labour party activists from our conference that is taking gutter politics to a new low
1777045 i briefly went into the foyer of the town hall with a young nat
1777046 he had recognised me outside the hall as being a writer from the standard and quite why im not sure thought it would be a good idea for me to come and talk to the president of national
1777047 were just a bunch of people from the left wing i dont even vote labour
1777048 youre speaking to someone whos had the national partys closest ally the exclusive brethren put private detectives on to me and my husband ive seen it all frankly

1777052 flour power will give the appearance that a giant has walked through the city gathering lamp posts like flowers collecting them into a bunch wrapping a tyre around them and placing the whole lot as a centrepiece in the stewart plaza
1777053 flour power has a point to make in canterbury fields of crops have given way to fields of houses rows of wheat have been replaced by rows of streetlights farm tractors have grown smaller and multiplied exponentially growing sleeker and faster modified to pull chicks instead of ploughs
1777054 an organization can only become the best version of itself to the extent that the people who drive that organization are striving to become better versions of themselves
1777055 a companys purpose is to become the best version of itself the question is what is an employees purpose most would say to help the company achieve its purpose but they would be wrong that is certainly part of the employees role but an employees primary purpose is to become the best version of himself or herself when a company forgets that it exists to serve customers it quickly goes out of business our employees are our first customers and our most important customers
1777056 well of course id be happy to get a job if i could

1777120 in fact i have this knack of knowing just what a young man like yourself needs what you fantasize about and what you really crave just think how excited youre going to be when i take you home with me and make all of those dirty dreams of yours come true
1777121 what im offering you is a chance to live out your most secret fantasies a chance to let your secret self out for a night
1777122 well michael shall i tell you what it is that you want me to do to you my little boy
1777123 my guess is youd like me to take control to take you home with me tie you up so you couldnt move a muscle and then tease you for hours until you spurt globs of cum make you do all those nasty little things you would never have the courage to do on your own
1777124 and i do hope im only using that phrase figuratively do you have the courage to live those desires
1777125 lets get out of here then im suddenly ravenous but what i crave isnt on the menu
1777126 wrap each end around your wrist as far as you can
1777127 you have the power to end it anytime you wish all you have to do is relax your hands and let go of the scarf do you understand now

1777130 ill let you undo your hands for exactly fifteen seconds
1777131 if you want to end it here all you have to do is relax your hands and let that scarf fall to the floor
1777132 but i have to worry about paying my bills how can i stay i the present moment when i have bills to pay

1777139 no man has a good enough memory to make a successful liar
1777140 telling lies is a fault in a boy an art in a lover an accomplishment in a bachelor and second nature in a married man
1777141 most women are dishonest and i only give them a dose of their own medicine
1777142 the false hair nails cake of makeup wonder bras and high heels give a false image making the womans whole appearance a lie
1777143 that way no one gets hurt remember that what you dont know cannot hurt you
1777144 they keep several men whom they play with amazing success one is for paying rent another for taking her out another for buying lunch and another for buying scratch cards
1777145 maybe he learnt that the woman prefers rich classy men and you are just an average guy struggling to earn a living so you lie because this is the only way to get her
1777146 a mans view of love is action driven rather than emotion driven if he lies the consequences of his actions are not on his mind
1777147 men use lies to cover up their failures or mistakes by lying they are compensating for what they do not have or what they have never achieved
1777148 we do not tell everything all we do is withhold information from those we love
1777149 we exaggerate to get what we want we have to be on the same level or higher than our rivals
1777150 if my rival is driving a bmw i have to quote an equally posh car so the woman can feel comfortable in my company
1777151 they want to hear that a guy is driving has worthwhile investments and has never had a girlfriend who are we to let her down
1777152 a woman as beautiful as sin flashes you a smile and your world stops at that moment you dont care whether you are married or not you want her irrespective of what you have to say
1777153 sometimes the guilt is exciting and has nothing to do with the woman even though it seems that way

1777165 we did not make this decision lightly but believe we were legally compelled to take this step because local 715 has failed in its duty to represent our employees
1777166 the hospitals cannot recognize uhw as our employees representative because that union was not elected directly by our employees
1777167 fairness and the law require a national labor relations board election in order to change employee representation
1777168 remain committed to providing competitive wages and benefits to all of our employees whether they are represented by a union or not
1777169 were hoping the election will happen in a matter of weeks
1777170 their attitude suggests they really have animus toward organized labor

1777172 when i created him he was a monster first then a guy underneath
1777173 i always thought spider man was a skinny runt of a guy and his villains felt more formidable if they were physically more superior
1777174 i didnt realize until afterward that it was eddie brock underneath which is why the proportions are the way they are in the comics with the big jaws and the hunching i pictured him as a creature and not a human being in a costume
1777175 you dont want to scare the kids because the kids love the character
1777176 but i think you could add a little bit of a creep factor i mean it never bugged me to watch frankenstein as a kid so you could have a little bit of it as long as you have a good story backing it up
1777177 im thinking about how they want to make anti heroes nowadays
1777178 those dont work the reason theyre so cool as a bad guy is because theyre bad and as soon as you try to give too much humanity to them then you go no now theyre not as good as a bad guy because youre trying to redeem them
1777179 but they were human can you bring that mentality to venom and make it work or do you make him all bad
1777180 youre trying to give something to people when they leave i dont know if you can have a movie about a guy who goes out there and maims everybody and wins all the time

1777182 now one of the very first requirements for a man who is fit to handle pig iron as a regular occupation is that he shall be so stupid and so phlegmatic that he more nearly resembles in his mental make up the ox than any other type the man who is mentally alert and intelligent is for this very reason entirely unsuited to what would for him be the grinding monotony of work of this character therefore the workman who is best suited to handling pig iron is unable to understand the real science of doing this class of work
1777183 modern medicine and medical science have really accomplished some extraordinary things but some of them are very expensive
1777184 this book will expose the real pharmaceutical industry an industry that over the past two decades has moved very far from its original high purpose of discovering and producing useful new drugs
1777185 the drug industry files bogus patents buries its competition generic manufacturers in frivolous lawsuits and even colludes with those manufacturers to keep lower priced generics off the market the industry also engages in fraudulent drug pricing and deceptive marketing and it funds groups that claim to represent consumers opposed to strategies aimed at putting a lid on prescription drug prices

1777187 the potential for aplastic anemia must be considered whenever chloramphenicol is used regardless of the route of administration
1777188 we certainly are in a health care crisis if we had set out to design the worst system that we could imagine we couldnt have imagined on as bad as we have our health care system is based on the premise that health care is a commodity like vcrs or computers and that it should be distributed according to the ability to pay in the same way that consumer goods are and that market ideology is what has made the health care system so dreadful so bad at what it does

1777200 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation now is substantially driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1777201 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of globalized corporations than many millions of poor farmers living on the frontier
1777202 we argue that the recent shift from poverty driven deforestation to industry driven deforestation may offer new opportunities for rainforest conservation in that it is easier for pressure groups to target corporations and enterprises rather than tens of millions of poor farmers who are simply trying to put food on the table for their families
1777203 while it may seem evident that activist groups are effectively using boycotts and public shaming campaigns we believe this paper identifies why this strategy is likely to continue to be effective relative to past approaches we are already seeing industry respond with initiatives like the roundtable on sustainable palm oil the amazon soy moratorium and moves by the timber industry in the state of para
1777204 several financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup inc and bank of america corp have made concessions on their lending and funding practices relating to forest destruction following campaigns from environmentalists
1777205 meanwhile some of the worlds largest commodity producers including cargill the maggi group archer daniels midland and bunge have agreed to stop processing soybeans grown on rainforest lands deforested since 2006 so far the ban is showing positive results
1777206 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1777207 roads and transportation projects are still a crucial proximate cause of deforestation in many regions
1777208 many industrial activities e g logging mining oil gas development promote deforestation indirectly by providing an economic incentive for road building so there is an interaction between deforestation being promoted by industrial global drivers and deforestation by small scale farmers and colonists one facilitates the other
1777209 if ecosystem services markets can make conservation of natural forests a profitable endeavor for enterprise the opportunity cost of deforestation will increase dramatically
1777210 the net result could be enterprise driven preservation of wild lands of course the key to the success of this effort is ensuring that rural populations and forest dwellers share in the proceeds without their partnership deforestation is not going to go away
1777211 one wonders if the association is the other way around

1777222 that agency our military personnel are fighting for a peace that we look more than interested in achieving than the iraki politicians make themselves
1777223 and as the iraki leadership retarding force their feet the cost of the warfare to our troops to our national security and to our exchequer maintains rising

1777225 these people have no continuing value nor make they present a additional menace to iraki security

1777243 chile no es una dictadura es una democracia y cuando el gobierno pretende aplicar la ley mordaza a funcionarios p blicos para que expresen libremente sus opiniones lo que est haciendo es una acci n antidemocr tica

1777308 hern n cristante es un extraordinario profesional en el campo y en el vestidor tenemos un gran equipo en todos los aspectos con los muchachos comprometidos gente con trayectoria gente con logros estamos muy orgullosos de estar en esta instituci n
1777309 hicimos sobre todo en el primer tiempo un partido casi perfecto despu s obviamente con la expulsi n se nos complic pero creo que toluca hizo un gran partido fuimos muy superiores pero creo que tuvimos que haber definido desde la primera parte
1777310 una de las grandes virtudes que tiene este equipo es que se defiende con una gran propiedad y atenci n me parece que estamos compitiendo a gran nivel sin tener todav a a jugadores importantes al cien como daniel andr s r os y qu decir de sinha e israel l pez
1777311 creo que el equipo hizo un trabajo muy bueno se le gana a un rival de mucha jerarqu a despu s de habernos quedado con diez jugadores pr cticamente dejamos de atacar y ellos encontraron el gol con caba as se nos complic el partido pero al final sacamos un triunfo muy importante
1777312 cambia igual con diez jugadores ante un rival que juega bien siempre es dif cil pero tenemos a hern n cristante que nos ha salvado nuevamente hoy el equipo hizo un gran partido un gran desgaste
1777313 lo que pasa es dif cil un tiro as nadie se lo espera m s todav a con un hern n que recorri muy bien pero es merito de l tambi n hay que darle el m rito al que hizo un golazo

1777396 in our 23 years of existence we have had very few experiences that felt as right as our initial performance at roadburn in 2007 roadburn is a unique experience in the often disappointing and disingenuous world of music it is a festival organized and run by people with a true passion and dedication to sound in the spirit of this commitment we are proud to announce that the day of april 25 2009 at roadburn will be a rekindling of beyond the pale we will be performing as well as curating the entire days events
1777397 roadburn is very pleased to invite our spiritual brethren from neurosis to host a european version of their
1777398 on saturday april 25 neurosis will have complete freedom to invite all the bands and set the lineups for each of the stages over the years neurosis has exhibited an amazing commitment and dedication to the art of underground music something that we at roadburn understand and appreciate completely we are looking forward to the new ideas that they will bring to the festival as we feel they are truly kindred spirits we look forward to uniting at roadburn 2009
1777399 it is a great honor and privilege to have asked to host our own beyond the pale event at roadburn 2009 since playing roadburn 2007 we could think of no better people to work with on this event than the organizers and promoters of roadburn and the wonderful staff at the 013 roadburn is a completely different experience than the traditional music festival it is a small intimate extremely well organized festival put together by people who love the bands and thrive on creating a unique social vibe where the lines between artist audience and staff are often completely blurred
1777400 2009 also marks the 10th anniversary of our own label neurot recordings what an amazing way to mark our first decade as a label i believe that roadburn and neurosis share a clarity of vision that will result in an amazing experience for us all

1777421 le pido no s si paciencia o tranquilidad yo cuando llegue lo dije conf o en mis medios se que muchos jugadores muchos goleadores pasaron por el equipo as como muchos delanteros que no rindieron
1777422 yo s lo que fue jos cardozo lo que fue vicente s nchez lo que fue bruno marioni lo que fue christian gim nez un mont n de jugadores que pasaron que unos rindieron y otros no como la gente lo esperaba pero yo conf o en mis medios se que puedo rendir la calidad del equipo que tenemos es para rendir y para hacer mucho goles as que confi en m en mis propios compa eros y se que puedo llegar a hacer mi propia historia aqu en toluca

1777427 la gente le ha exigido porque no resiste m s que los goles no lleguen hay que preguntarle al argentino christian gim nez como le fue cada tarde en la cancha del nemesio diez la afici n no perdona pero con todo y abucheos se le debe de dar m s oportunidad a mancilla quien por lo pronto ya se estren como goleador
1777428 no me preocupa en lo m s m nimo porque igual mancilla meti goles en pretemporada nadie dijo nada es m s porque as es la gente no me molesta al contrario vamos a hacer ver a la gente que esto es de grupo que no porque sea el centro delantero tiene que ser a fuerzas el goleador pero s es parte importante en el ataque como puede ser santiago fern ndez como pueden ser todos ya les coment a los jugadores que en nuestro ataque el principal delantero es la porter a y el principal defensa es el delantero entonces esto es de conjunto

1777431 we used data from pulsars stars that flash with a regular pulse
1777432 as light from these pulsars travels to us it interacts with electrons scattered between the stars the warm ionised medium or wim which slows the light down
1777433 in particular the longer redder wavelengths of the pulse slow down more than the shorter bluer wavelengths so by seeing how far the red lags behind the blue we can calculate how much wim the pulse has travelled through

1777510 also what of people are driving around with poorly inflated tires less than 10 for sure
1777511 more than a quarter of all cars and nearly one third of all suvs vans and pickups are driven with tires at least 8 pounds below their proper levels according to a new survey by the department of transportation
1777512 i can guarantee you that half of all drivers in the united states are not rollin on under inflated tires but i encourage you to find any fact to support that you my friend have no business voting
1777513 however obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing mccain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry the obama campaign has said the illinois senator supported the legislation because it included huge investments in renewable energy
1777514 so anyone who doesnt arrive at the same conclusions you do has no business voting wow is that what all liberals think
1777515 or someone could speculate that the increased production when it does come on that other oilfields producing today will decline in daily production
1777516 since the problem is speculation why not close the enron loophole
1777517 a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and what no just government should refuse or rest on inference
1777518 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
1777519 oh man obama said i should keep my tires properly inflated i guess that means i should drive around with 20 psi and 1 flat tire anymore
1777520 overall there were an estimated 250 851 833 registered passenger vehicles in the united states according to a 2006 dot study
1777521 also just because you keep copy paste ing that comment that doesnt make it true
1777522 obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1777523 mccain thinks have proper tire inflation is good who doesn t but it is not a country s energy policy
1777524 no archie it will not have a quicker effect unless you make it mandatory to have properly inflated tires
1777525 we would have the same effect as mccains plan if we just filled our tires with air
1777526 mccain was making fun of the fact that obama basically stated
1777527 mccain never said filling tires with air wouldnt help at all he just mocked the fact that it would break oil independence and create as much oil as offshore drilling which it wont
1777528 u s auto makers debunk mccain on value of tire inflation
1777529 in conclusion please dont make stupid comments on subjects you dont know anything about and its not a band aid 3 is a real amount
1777530 in conclusion please dont make stupid comments on subjects you dont know anything about and its not a band aid 3 is a real amount
1777531 correct tire pressure will relieve our dependence on the middle east
1777532 it was moronic because he took it a step further and suggested that keeping tires properly inflated would save as much fuel as offshore drilling would produce that is the part he was ridiculed for and for good reason
1777533 it only blew up in mccains face on digg doofus
1777534 secondly it wont have an immediate effect unless it is made mandatory and someone would actually enforce it
1777535 so if they see an additional source of supply in the future it will drive down prices now
1777536 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
1777537 looks like digg is doing everything they can to try to convince people that this idiotic statement by obama holds some merit
1777538 it does say alot about the intelligence of the average mccain follower compared to the average obama follower
1777539 washington d c april 23 2006 the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa statistics show that about one in every three cars has a significantly under inflated tire and that 660 fatalities and 33 000 injuries occur every year as a result of low tire pressure related crashes aaa reports that each year they receive about 4 million roadside assistance calls due to tire related incidents not surprisingly a 2006 rubber manufacturers association rma survey found that more than 80 percent of drivers do not know how to properly check their tire pressure
1777540 mccains drilling scenario is part of a complete renewable energy scenario involving alternative fuels intiatives funding automaker research funding nuclear energy re implementation
1777541 off shore drilling to control the price of oil until mass market alternatives are available
1777542 obama has proposed absolutely nothing that would make the price of oil go down
1777543 the federal government estimates the nations outer continental shelf might hold 85 9 billion barrels of crude including 10 13 billion barrels off california
1777544 saying that is the equivalent of drilling hundred of thousands of extra barrels of oil is insanely wrong
1777545 we are using world health organization who standards for evaluation they are fairly tough to meet but in many aspects beijing does

1777573 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1777603 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1777604 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1777605 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand

1777617 johnny blaze rocks up in a strange little town in the forests of idaho
1777618 hes looking for a way to get to heaven in order to kick some haloed ass but he cant just kill himself or even just wait to die because his soul would go straight to hell allowing the spirit of vengeance inside him to return to heaven poor old johnnys in a bit of a bind
1777619 but hes heard theres a winged creature haunting the woods near this little town called mercy and hes got it into his head it might be an angel he wants to ask it some questions searching for a way to get to heaven of course its never as simple as all that
1777620 mercys picked up an odd reputation as somewhere that people go in order to die
1777621 its burdened by this long string of suicides people arrive on the greyhound bus and never go home again add to
1777622 i guess theres a bit of x files in there all that heavily forested spooky wookiness and more than a little bit of the mothman prophecies
1777623 mostly its a creepy story about faith hope and suicide with a glorious dose of supernatural action and all rendered in the stunning artwork of mark robinson
1777624 hes been manipulated by forces he doesnt understand someones been screwing with his dreams and he wants nothing more than to cut loose on someone or something which can provide a few answers
1777625 hes not entirely certain but he hopes hes going to find an angel in mercy what he actually gets is something far stranger and far more laden with possibilities it turns out that mercy might actually provide him with exactly what he needs a direct path into paradise

1777751 la fantasia non nientaltro che una serie di ricordi che si manifestano
1777752 queste facolt appartengono alla mente ma sono radicate nel corpo e traggono vigore dal corpo perci la memoria lo stesso che la fantasia
1777753 immagini di sostanze animate o di dei ed eroi formati per mezzo della fantasia
1777754 il pi sublime lavoro della poesia dare senso e passione alle cose insensate
1777755 i bambini prendono oggetti inanimati tra le loro mani e si divertono con essi come fossero esseri viventi
1777756 pensiamo che il bambino sia un grande errore che ha sempre bisogno di essere corretto e invece abbiamo proprio a che fare con un essere un po strano insolito che ancora consapevole di cose con le quali noi abbiamo perso il contatto e che conosce cose che noi abbiamo dimenticato forse cancellate per sempre dalla nostra memoria
1777757 cose che abbiamo dimenticato forse persino cancellate dai nostri ricordi
1777758 amarcord era un film sul dire addio ad una delle stagioni della vita a quella incorreggibile adolescenza che minaccia di restarci attaccata per sempre
1777759 fino a un certo punto fascismo e adolescenza restano come periodi storici permanenti delle nostre vite

1777761 incantata dai sogni del cinema americano popolati di frenetiche masturbazioni in attesa di un avvenimento glorioso
1777762 per il privilegio di essere italiani o per virt dellazzurro dei nostri cieli o del papa o di dante alighieri

1777765 we are not mouthpieces we are not gunslingers that do the bidding of someone whose rationale we do not share and whose view of the world

1777771 congress giveth and taketh away so you cant just thumb your nose at congress and say were going to make these decisions based only on our enforcement needs
1777772 they say they have a formula but im not convinced or persuaded that this is altogether a rational distribution of resources theres a certain amount of whoever screams and yells gets taken care of first
1777773 sadly money was the real issue and not the players themselves clubs pay the wages and they should be concerned but ill never understand why they just arent upfront about what they want and what they want is compensation if injuries occur

1777779 we cant let the loss of one industry hurt us like that again

1777784 the macro economic conditions are most of it with high gas prices and declines in home values which makes it a really difficult time for casual dining restaurants

1777813 advertisements contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper
1777814 the amount of data we have access to keeps growing by leaps and bounds every year and the bigger it gets the harder it is to sift through
1777815 dashboards allow us to present data in visual fashion that makes it more intuitive and useful so our people can find what interests them then drill down into the data to find out more
1777816 we help companies understand what metrics to look at what data they need to collect and how to make it visual
1777817 with our dashboards you never see more than three of four things at once because the average person cant assimilate more data than that at one time

1777822 a 50 percent increase in natural gas prices is absolutely possible

1777825 the pendulum has swing from being overly aggressive with mortgage lending to overly conservative with mortgage lending

1777827 if its a loan to value issue if they were approved under a 90 percent loan and their property has devalued then there really is no recourse
1777828 its much harder to get financing for people with low credit scores but the answer is not to put somebody into a lender who will refinance at a high rate and theyll be right back where they started from
1777829 the answer is to help somebody improve their credit score so we can help them get the lower rate today that they actually need in order to make the payments on that house
1777830 very often a person will be financeable just not to the bank they would normally go
1777831 we have so many loans under our umbrella that we can determine what lender will do that for them even though two out of three wont there will be certain situations where we will not be able to refinance someone but its pretty unusual

1777858 price will be the crucial determinant in terms of what consumers spend on

1778019 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
1778020 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
1778021 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
1778022 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
1778023 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
1778024 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
1778025 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
1778026 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

1778035 across the industrialized world women still live 5 to 10 years longer than men among people over 100 years old 85 are women according to tom perls founder of the new england centenarian study at boston university
1778036 women left the workforce when the cost of child care ate up their entire after tax salaries or when family unfriendly workplaces pushed them out or when like women without children or men with and without children they were laid off in a bad economy
1778037 women may be more susceptible to the impact of the business cycle than they were when they were more highly concentrated in a smaller number of non cyclical occupations like teaching and nursing

1778059 previously we said house prices would fall at least 15 percent nationally peak to trough todays challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing

1778074 durch die subprime krise sind abs in die kritik geraten zu unrecht sie sind ein wertvolles kapitalmarktinstrument problematisch ist nur der spekulative umgang mit ihnen k nftig werden investoren deswegen h here transparenz einfordern
1778075 die reduzierten volumina sind daher gewiss als zeichen der konsolidierung und nicht als das ende des produktes zu sehen die verbriefung lebt der conduit markt funktioniert weiterhin
1778076 in einem punkt wird sich die abs welt aber ver ndern die transparenz wird zunehmen um das vertrauen der investoren in die transaktionsbeteiligten eine zentrale erfolgsvoraussetzung wieder herzustellen

1778090 this is an important step in supporting communities that are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters experience shows that many lives can be saved if people know what precautions to take and how to react when the disaster strikes
1778091 mozambique madagascar malawi and the comoros all suffer the serious effects of tropical storms that develop in the indian ocean this type of action is especially important in a context of rising food prices and climate change
1778092 the number of extreme weather events has increased sharply in recent years climate change already seems to be having a serious humanitarian impact
1778093 the decision to extend it dipecho to the southwest indian ocean reflects an unfortunate reality more cyclones are occurring in that area causing ever more structural damage and serious flooding
1778094 last years number of reported disasters confirmed the global upward trend in natural disaster occurrence this upward trend is mainly driven by the increase in the number of reported hydro meteorological disasters
1778095 the funding targets communities that are already vulnerable because of extreme poverty isolation due to weak infrastructure and difficult communications and in malawi and mozambique the high incidence of hiv and aids
1778096 the increase in extreme climatic events keeps such communities in a state of constant quasi emergency and does not allow them to establish the long term coping mechanisms they need to allow real development to take off
1778097 it also means that limited resources can be used more effectively the cost of good preparation is a lot less than the cost of clearing up the mess afterwards
1778098 important lessons were learned from the big floods in mozambique in 2000 and 2001 when hundreds died the floods of 2007 were of a similar magnitude and in the same area but the government and actors on the ground were much better prepared
1778099 around 230 000 people were displaced and or lost their livelihoods but large scale fatalities were avoided
1778100 including practical training in disaster response for community groups and institutions early warning systems public information campaigns and small scale infrastructure works
1778101 in madagascar it has been calculated that a child living in a disaster prone area loses on average one full school year due to lack of access to or destruction of their schools
1778102 which can also serve as shelters for the community and by funding the acquisition of small boats for example which allow children to continue to access their schools even in heavily flooded areas
1778103 why didnt you stay out longer and catch more fish
1778104 i have more than enough to support my familys needs
1778105 but what do you do with the rest of your time
1778106 i sleep late fish a little play with my children take siesta with my wife maria stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos i have a full and busy life
1778107 i am a harvard mba and could help you you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor eventually opening your own cannery you would control the product processing and distribution you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city then los angeles and eventually new york where you will run your ever expanding enterprise
1778108 when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich you would make millions
1778109 thats the best part you could then retire move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late fish a little play with your kids take siesta with your wife stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos

1778113 such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society
1778114 the respect for individual decision making in matters of fundamental personal importance reflected in the american jurisprudence also informs the canadian charter
1778115 it is probably impossible for a man to respond even imaginatively to such a dilemma not just because it is outside the realm of his personal experience although this is of course the case but because he can relate to it only by objectifying it thereby eliminating the subjective elements of the female psyche which are at the heart of the dilemma
1778116 womens needs and aspirations are only now being translated into protected rights
1778117 at the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence of meaning of the universe and of the mystery of human life
1778118 race religious beliefs colour gender physical disability mental disability marital status age ancestry or place of origin
1778119 not one public voice was raised in opposition to the end of british north america
1778120 charter has also played its part in encouraging us to forget our own history law students are unshakeably convinced of two things about the canada that existed before the charter first canadians simply had no rights until we adopted the charter and second until it got a constitutional guarantee of rights canada was just not a proper respectable country
1778121 a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a constitution like that under consideration which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns
1778122 would contain various exceptions to powers which are not granted and on this very account would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted for why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do
1778123 furnish to men disposed to usurp a plausible pretense for claiming that power they might urge with a semblance of reason that the constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given
1778124 public opinion and on the general spirit of the people and of the government
1778125 would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government
1778126 not based on philosophy but on tradition if one cannot be sure about the answers to the most important questions then tradition is the best basis for the practical life those who loved the older traditions of canada may be allowed to lament what has been lost even though they do not know whether or not that loss will lead to some greater political good

1778136 la ausencia de competencia y la disminuci n de material de vuelo fueron las causas casi fundamentales en el retroceso de la l nea de bandera
1778137 la presi n del gobierno para hacerse nuevamente de la l nea de bandera no es tal sino m s bien es el producto de un negocio que ha dejado de ser rentable para el operador privado y de esta forma debe concurrir a esta reestatizaci n que no est muy definida todav a
1778138 cuando una empresa entra en crisis las causas son siempre diversas por un lado es evidente que el grupo marsans no supo manejar la compa a correctamente pero tambi n es cierto que la mayor parte de las l neas a reas atraviesan serias dificultades sin ir m s lejos la tradicional alitalia vive hoy conflictos similares a los de las aerol neas argentinas
1778139 la mayor a de las l neas a reas sufren problemas sin importar que sean privadas o estatales factores como el aumento descomunal del precio del petr leo afectan al sector en su conjunto de modo que es dif cil determinar si las compa as nacionales responden mejor que las privadas en el panorama actual
1778140 hay pocas dudas de que los gobiernos del matrimonio kirchner tienen una orientaci n que asigna al estado un rol preponderante incluyendo su car cter empresario
1778141 la reestatizaci n de empresas p blicas puede verse como una pol tica que estos gobiernos aplican toda vez que un conjunto de factores que no necesariamente tienen el mismo car cter en cada caso conducen a esta opci n est o no t cnicamente justificada hasta tony blair ex primer ministro de gran breta a lleg a su segundo mandato prometiendo que reestatizar a los ferrocarriles debido a su desastroso funcionamiento
1778142 por el contrario las re estatizaciones fueron pocas y en actividades muy diversas como el correo y el agua
1778143 este traspaso de empresas al estado en argentina y venezuela se dan en la misma fecha pero la situaci n de argentina con espa a es buena y no creo que se llegue a situaciones similares
1778144 existen notorias diferencias entre los proyectos pol ticos de ambos gobiernos por m s que una similar vocaci n de poder de sus jefes de estado pareciera identificarlos no creo que la presidenta argentina est dispuesta a recrear el inmenso estado empresario que existi hasta fines del gobierno de ra l alfons n 1983 1989 en argentina aunque s creo que ch vez no ver a con desagrado esa meta
1778145 se hace cargo de una compa a en serias dificultades econ micas operativas y sindicales
1778146 que las del rubro energ tico estar n en la lista de hecho las tarifas actuales atrasadas despu s del cambio de precios relativos de 2002 y las magras inversiones llevan a una situaci n poco feliz en cuanto a la provisi n de fluido energ tico para el aumento de la capacidad potencial de producir que la demanda local hoy exige
1778147 para las empresas privadas de electricidad y gas sometidas a una continua negociaci n con el gobierno por el nivel de las tarifas y los subsidios la situaci n puede llegar a ser dif cil de sobrellevar
1778148 se trata de una cuesti n crucial a resolver durante la gesti n de marsans las protestas sindicales fueron un obst culo constante para la normal prestaci n del servicio por ello una de las tareas del estado argentino ser dejar una empresa en orden y con su cuesti n laboral resuelta a fin de hacerla atractiva a los ojos del sector privado el ministro de planificaci n julio de vido declar a la prensa que la misi n m s inmediata ser la puesta en valor de la empresa por ello si bien estimo que se quedar con una cuota de su l nea de bandera creo que dar lugar a socios del sector privado
1778149 creo que lo mejor ser a ahora una operaci n conjunta entre el estado argentino y los operadores privados en condiciones de igualdad incluyendo a los 6 sindicatos en el tema para llevar adelante el negocio todo el proceso de concesiones de los 90 han dejado en la sociedad la imagen de que las operadoras privadas empeoraron los servicios y el estado no tiene m s salida que actuar
1778150 hace 35 40 a os era muy com n que el gobierno saliera al rescate de empresas privadas en dificultades como fue el caso de la industrial siam di tella o italo argentina de electricidad
1778151 el estado deber emprender cambios profundos en su relaci n con los sindicatos proveedores y clientes as como con los rganos pol ticos del gobierno nacional adem s de dise ar un plan estrat gico que consolide y expanda sus rutas modernice su flota y coloque al frente de la empresa a verdaderos profesionales de la gesti n
1778152 esta guerra por poderes fue muy negativa para la directiva de yahoo
1778153 el arma m s poderosa que tiene un inversor y normalmente se emplean como ltimo recurso
1778154 en general los inversores activistas consideran que es mejor evitar las guerras por delegaci n no es algo que se hace porque s sus costes son muy elevados se estima que miles de millones de d lares
1778155 normalmente las guerras por poderes no tienen mucho efecto a veces s pero es muy complicado teniendo en cuenta la inercia de los accionistas la mayor a votan con la directiva
1778156 no deber an llegar a dicha situaci n sinceramente nadie gana con una guerra por poderes una guerra por poderes representa la incapacidad de la directiva para responder a las preocupaciones de los accionistas los consejos deber an haber sido m s receptivos ante las peticiones de los accionistas
1778157 en caso de que haya alg n beneficio de esta guerra por poderes entre icahn y yahoo el beneficio ser a que la directiva ha quedado advertida no puede ignorar la realidad
1778158 las guerras por delegaci n son molestas pero son una se al de que las cosas no pueden seguir como estaban
1778159 responde a todo tipo de intereses menos los de los accionistas
1778160 resulta evidente que microsoft despu s de haber fracasado en el rea de las b squedas se est colocando del lado de los intereses a corto plazo del sr icahn para convencer a yahoo para que venda sus estrat gicos activos de b squedas en t rminos muy ventajosos para microsoft pero muy poco interesantes para los accionistas de yahoo
1778161 a lo largo de estos a os he intentado realizar cambios en muchas empresas pero nunca hab a visto una empresa que distorsionase omitiese y tergiversase los hechos del modo en que yahoo lo ha hecho en el comunicado de prensa publicado el s bado 12 de julio
1778162 seguir adelante con cualquier acuerdo con microsoft que le permitiese recuperar su inversi n y su dinero r pidamente
1778163 ahora es m s f cil comunicarse la tecnolog a y la capacidad para iniciar una guerra por poderes han mejorado
1778164 el activismo es m s frecuente debido al modo en que operan los fondos de alto riesgo
1778165 son mejores a la hora de organizar a la gente tienen muchos recursos y las guerras por delegaci n son una de sus armas las batallas por poderes suponen para ellos un modo de ganar dinero
1778166 los fondos de inversi n mutual funds no quieren dirigir las empresas si no les gusta algo simplemente venden sus acciones los fondos de alto riesgo intentar n dirigir la empresa para incrementar su valor todos los accionistas se pueden beneficiar
1778167 esta gente tiene una participaci n muy significativa y su inversi n en la empresa est muy concentrada quieren recuperar su inversi n
1778168 a lo largo y ancho del planeta est n intentando controlar m s a las directivas se trata de una tendencia de largo plazo
1778169 y si la econom a est en declive los accionistas no suelen estar contentos
1778170 es urgente adem s impulsar una agenda paralela de acciones de pol ticas p blicas que incrementen la competitividad y el crecimiento econ mico a nivel federal y local
1778171 de pol ticas p blicas agresivas bien enfocadas y estrat gicas
1778172 son los tres puntos para tener una base s lida de la cual partir
1778173 goliat es este estado grosso ampuloso pesado asfixiante excesivo que deja caer todo su peso sobre el pobre ciudadano que es david y asfixia la actividad emprendedora de david lo aplasta lo inhibe lo coh be le coarta su derecho a emprender su garant a constitucional de libre empresa
1778174 la tardanza para hacer negocios la burocracia la ineficiencia administrativa en am rica latina son consecuencia del grave error que cometieron en la d cada de los 70 los gobiernos al pretender erigirse como empleadores
1778175 se tienen clar simas barreras de entrada de nuevos competidores en sectores estrat gicos
1778176 si quieres crecer en el corto plazo es competencia lo que necesitas porque competencia significa eficiencia y transferencia de recursos hacia la poblaci n
1778177 fomentar la competencia es algo que se puede hacer sin medicaciones constitucionales t a trav s del fomento de la competencia generas otros cambios positivos es un incentivo para volverse m s productivo obligas a las empresas a incorporar mejoras los obligas a buscar eficiencias en los procesos productivos la competencia es un arma poderos sima para sacar adelante la econom a
1778178 combatir la corrupci n es el punto n mero uno y el m s importante de todos
1778179 la corrupci n hace que las cosas vayan hacia atr s
1778180 en un barco como m xico en donde como sistema se corrompe el barco se hunde
1778181 mientras mantengamos los actuales niveles de acceso al financiamiento no hay manera de competir
1778182 al gobierno le falta decisi n en todos los niveles
1778183 se requiere de la enorme determinaci n y el apoyo del propio presidente para poder sacar adelante esta agenda
1778184 si se trabaja en estos rubros pero lo cierto es que no ser a para nada nimio estos cambios elevar an sin duda el crecimiento econ mico del pa s y el crecimiento econ mico es un factor b sico para mejorar la calificaci n soberana de un pa s
1778185 mientras nosotros no los hacemos hay otros pa ses que s los est n haciendo y que por lo tanto nos est n rebasando en los ndices de competitividad
1778186 los consejos de administraci n estaban retirando algunos beneficios porque cre an que no contribu an a la buena imagen de la empresa
1778187 pero creo que esa poca ha pasado y ahora la cuesti n es saber si esas pr cticas son importantes para el reclutamiento y la retenci n de personal si la econom a pierde fuerza puede haber una vuelta al rigor fue lo que sucedi en 2001 cuando la econom a perdi fuerza
1778188 no recomiendo la retirada de beneficios sin embargo si no quedara otra salida la direcci n debe recordar que cuando se quita alguna cosa a alguien la impresi n que queda es de injusticia
1778189 si la gesti n decide retirar alg n beneficio debe tratar de explicar de forma muy clara por qu lo hizo de manera que el trabajador considere justa la decisi n
1778190 son las remuneraciones en especie una exageraci n de la gesti n
1778191 en el que analizaba m s de 300 empresas entre 1986 y 1999
1778192 descubrimos que aunque los beneficios transmitan una imagen de exceso nuestros resultados mostraron que aunque puedan ser excesivos para quienes est n en la cima de media hay indicaciones de que las empresas los ofrecen con el prop sito de aumentar la productividad de los ejecutivos
1778193 muchos c nyuges no consideran ese tipo de evento como unas vacaciones
1778194 hay muchas cosas que considera beneficios pero que francamente la persona a las que se los conceden dir an sin ning n pudor gracias por nada
1778195 otro ejemplo com n de eso son los costosos sistemas de seguridad que las empresas instalan en las casas de sus ejecutivos para protegerlos y por extensi n a la empresa
1778196 las cifras relativas a la seguridad son fabulosas pero tal vez el individuo diga simplemente preferir a mi parte en dinero gracias
1778197 s lo a causa de la conexi n emocional que los beneficios proporcionan
1778198 en los viejos tiempos el equipo de administraci n se compon a de individuos blancos de una cierta edad que deseaban todos la misma cosa
1778199 ahora las personas con hijos peque os valoran m s la atenci n a sus hijos que la pertenencia a un club
1778200 muchas veces es preciso mantener esos acuerdos en secreto para que no haya comparaciones
1778201 la concesi n de beneficios amplios para todos en tiempos de vacas flacas
1778202 observamos un aumento en los beneficios voluntarios a medida que los costes de salud y los beneficios tradicionales aumentan los empleadores buscan proporcionar sin coste alguno algo que sea interpretado como verdaderamente valioso por el empleado
1778203 vale la pena analizar financieramente hasta qu punto los empleados est n dispuestos a intercambiar salario por beneficios
1778204 frente a la ausencia de beneficios fiscales los empleados suelen preferir dinero a beneficios y pueden estar dispuestos a recibir una reducci n de un d lar de beneficios a cambio de menos de un d lar de aumento del salario
1778205 las empresas que no ofrecen beneficios no aparecen en estas listas
1778206 no basta con los beneficios para que una empresa tenga xito
1778207 la entrada de lo nuevo en estructuras antiguas en una especie de boda realizada con prisas
1778208 suelen ser de largo plazo con nfasis en la construcci n de una relaci n de doble sentido con el cliente y no de uno solo
1778209 son modelos que ofrecen un nivel elevado de contenido y buscan cambiar las percepciones del usuario
1778210 ten amos un p blico muy bueno lo que nos llev a la idea del modelo de negocio
1778211 divertidas y significativas para la comunidad de usuarios de gaia y ventajosas para los patrocinadores
1778212 colocar el producto a prueba antes de lo previsto para saber lo que los clientes realmente quer an
1778213 normalmente hay un momento en el que uno se enfrenta a una crisis de autoestima y de valent a ya que no sabe si el producto es lo suficientemente bueno para pedir a alguien que pague por l sin embargo en lo que concierne al retorno financiero mi consejo es que se recoja r pidamente
1778214 singles 2007 so im guessing its a recent release no wonder i dont recall hearing it before wonder where i got it
1778215 si a lo anterior sumamos el fen meno de la convergencia tecnol gica donde hoy los computadores y notebook tienen funcionalidades de telefon a y los celulares cuentan con acceso a internet el tr fico de voz im genes y datos confidenciales han dejado de ser seguros contribuyendo en gran medida a un c ctel de amenazas y ciber cr menes
1778216 el volumen de transacciones en l nea de las firmas regionales es menor que el que presenta europa estados unidos y algunos mercados asi ticos
1778217 s lo entonces incurren en gastos para resguardar la informaci n m s sensible
1778218 la inversi n corporativa en sistemas de seguridad tambi n es m s baja en comparaci n con las naciones desarrolladas
1778219 el costo de las soluciones de seguridad es alto lo que tambi n constituye una valla para las compa as latinoamericanas
1778220 esta escasa preocupaci n se traduce en que algunos sitios webs d e bancos utilizan sistemas de protecci n de muy baja seguridad donde los usuarios acceden con claves de tan s lo cuatro d gitos
1778221 generalmente el username y password son muy d biles y por ende f ciles de copiar y clonar por los hackers
1778222 el problema es que incluso los empleados comparten entre s sus claves de acceso
1778223 la encriptaci n o codificaci n de la informaci n para que no pueda ser descifrada o interceptada es una herramienta muy eficaz para proteger los datos pero he visto problemas m s graves por su inadecuado uso que por su falta de aplicaci n por lo tanto tenemos un problema relacionado con la educaci n son contados los profesionales que hoy conocen las innovaciones que ofrece la industria de la seguridad y que saben c mo utilizarlas correctamente
1778224 e n la regi n venimos saliendo de un per odo extenso de gobiernos autoritarios bajo los cuales la protecci n de los datos personales era casi un contrasentido ello explica por qu la legislaci n actual privilegia el acceso eficiente a los datos antes que la protecci n de la identidad de los usuarios
1778225 en estados unidos o el reino unido una cosa de este tipo jam s ser a posible debido a los riesgos a la privacidad que ello implica
1778226 la participaci n de latinoam rica en eventos claves sobre seguridad inform tica es muy baja
1778227 en la d cada de los 80 los virus se propagaban por medio de disquetes nicamente infectaban a m quinas individuales y se propagaban en semanas o meses
1778228 el impacto es a nivel global y la velocidad de propagaci n puede llegar a infectar a cientos de miles de computadores en s lo segundos
1778229 las medianas y grandes empresas que no est n adaptadas al cambio tecnol gico de una sociedad conectada como la actual que elimina las barreras geogr ficas a trav s de la red la omisi n de est ndares de seguridad puede restarles dinamismo generar poca confiabilidad entre los clientes y con el tiempo afectar su competitividad en un mercado globalizado
1778230 muchas veces los robos de informaci n son realizados por las mismas personas que trabajan al interior de la organizaci n y este tipo de ataques no son tan sofisticados
1778231 por este motivo una de las primeras medidas que mellado recomienda para reducir el riesgo a un ataque como el robo de informaci n confidencial
1778232 una tercera medida es aplicar sistemas de encriptaci n y una cuarta estrategia deber a ser la aplicaci n de herramientas de autentificaci n con claves y controles biom tricos de identidad
1778233 los est ndares de seguridad deben ser patrocinados por la alta gerencia reafirmando as su compromiso con estos temas tal como lo exige la norma iso 27001 2005 sobre sistema de gesti n de seguridad de
1778234 la seguridad de los datos es un proceso integral que va desde la auditor a programaci n y pruebas hasta la puesta en marcha y la operaci n

1778281 in terms of assembly and demonstrations china has related laws and regulations we hope that foreigners will respect the related chinese laws and regulations

1778300 the travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges
1778301 intentionally provide material support or resources to an international terrorist organisation engaged in hostilities against the united states namely which the accused knew to be such an organisation that engaged or engages in terrorism and that the conduct of the accused took place in the context of and was associated with an armed conflict namely or its associated forces against the us or its coalition partners

1778318 in nine months send us a copy of the cd and good luck to you all of a sudden i just had to do it
1778319 it opened the floodgates and kind of grew into an obsession from there
1778320 it just has this barebones architecture theres nothing between you and her theres no artifice its all music that goes directly to the heart and it was just her her guitar and her voice
1778321 i loved her voice and i loved the melodies of her songs i fell in love with it on a total musical level
1778322 so when recording i felt like the intensity and the live ness factor was really important the songs are punk theyre very repetitive and aggressive the strumming is very fast and hard so the first thing i did was slow them down that opens up a lot of space
1778323 i think it was good for me to break out of what i had been doing because my music was in a certain niche it was really liberating to go out into this totally untracked terrain
1778324 this album just does not sound like any other thing im not saying this is good or bad but people cannot say this is a cross between rainer maria and blonde redhead they just cant its just its own fucking thing

1778362 hij minister aardenne sa was niet alleen kwaad op de actiegroep dat was logisch want diefstal kan niet worden goedgekeurd maar meer nog op de pers die gedeelten van gestolen documenten had gepubliceerd in elk geval wil ik duidelijk stellen dat de pers naar de opvatting van mijn fractie niet alleen het recht maar zelfs de morele plicht had om met name de brief van de minister aan de commissarissen van de koningin in noord brabant en limburg in de openbaarheid te brengen openheid en controleerbaarheid zijn immers onmisbare fundamenten van ons democratisch systeem de minister heeft hiervoor blijkbaar weinig gevoel
1778363 een ruimhartiger informatievoorziening van de kamer ware wenselijk geweest ook een op zichzelf begrijpelijke inspanningsverplichting moet vroeg of laat getoetst kunnen worden en dan liever vroeg dan laat de discussie was en blijft noodzakelijk ondanks het gegeven dat de betwiste brief bekend werd na een in alle opzichten afkeurenswaardige diefstal van overheidsdocumenten
1778364 de keuzes die ik twintig jaar geleden maakte zijn op geen enkele manier de keuzes die ik nu zou maken
1778365 klaar met studeren dus lekker 4 maanden naar nieuw zeeland

1778375 china often tells other countries to keep their hands out of its domestic issues but human rights are values without borders
1778376 after just six months weve successfully collected signatures from more than 1 3 million people in 127 countries around the world although they come from different social classes and backgrounds they all did something just
1778377 the situation has only become worse as china prepares for the olympic games in beijing
1778378 the chinese are proud of having the opportunity to host the olympics but as long as there are people who cry during the long dark nights china does not have anything to be proud of
1778379 we hereby call on china to fulfill its olympic promise and stop its persecution of falun gong followers before the games begin
1778380 china often tells other countries to keep their hands out of its domestic issues but human rights are values without borders
1778381 article 1 of the uns universal declaration of human rights says that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights
1778382 as a permanent member of the un security council the peoples republic of china should strictly follow this principle
1778383 instead of trying to control all religions in the country the chinese government should learn to respect each religions traditions
1778384 that dovbear just loves posting hyperlinks to stuff that many folks dont walk to talk about
1778385 hes trying to show that there are other facets to orthodox judaism that we dont all think one way and vote one way and hes occasionally entertaining when hes not being mean spirited
1778386 dovie is my best friend i love dovie i love him so much that im able to complain about him and bother him whenever i darn feel like it
1778387 dovbear a man with his hashkafas in the right place that is assuming you think the right place is bashing chassidim superstition the zohar spirituality and kugel which i do
1778388 dov bear has fantastic attributes candor loyalty truth courage a razor sharp mind and he flatters no one
1778389 dovbear does have a nice blog and i am a daily visitor but dont tell him i said so
1778390 hes witty hes funny he appreciates the ridiculous in life and has no qualms about telling you when he thinks that youre being a moron
1778391 notwithstanding his misguided politics i am amused by the postings of dovbear
1778392 no one is going to pay all that extra money for a phone call when they can make a call from a phone box
1778393 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency
1778394 john mccain stood up against george bush and don rumsfeld in the prosecution of the iraq war for many years
1778395 ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
1778396 id like to start out by giving you a little straight talk under the present setup because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today emphasis added and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its gotta be fixed
1778397 getting out of iraq will require just as much resolution as it took to get in and the same kind of resolution a willingness to ignore the consequences
1778398 farmed tilapia may be no better for you than a doughnut
1778399 ive never been emotionally attached to one of my coworkers
1778400 we estimate with obviously imperfect information that we are the market leader
1778401 we have worked hard to maintain dialogue with the organisers of the camp since they announced their intention to stage the event and well keep talking
1778402 the community residents of the camp have told us how they would like us to police them
1778403 we are considering their views and we will respond accordingly to move relationships forward
1778404 i would hope that we can continue to work with the organisers to police the site in a way that satisfies both ourselves and the people attending
1778405 our message remains very clear we will police the event proportionately so that the people attending it can protest lawfully
1778406 we know the vast majority of those on the site are responsible and law abiding and we want to be able to provide a service to them
1778407 they did not express an interest to come on the site for the first 24 hours and then they came on the site with violence seizing essential health and safety items
1778408 they have told us they are willing to accept that two officers can be on the site they have not been able to guarantee that they will not raid the site again
1778409 on the one hand they are very nice when talking to the liaison group but at the camp it is very different we feel pretty disempowered and used in the liaison group
1778410 i feel compelled to respond to your letter from the other woman in a relationship with a married man
1778411 my husband conducted a two year extra marital affair after many years of marriage
1778412 why did your reader end the three previous relationships that were headed nowhere
1778413 they killed you before you had a chance to surrender
1778414 council does not have jurisdiction to impose a financial contribution upon this present development
1778415 the development does not impose any burden on reserves nor network utility services such that any contribution might be properly levied
1778416 a financial contribution is appropriate with respect to this development as it will further intensify existing activities on the site
1778417 its no big deal dont worry about me you didnt sleep either
1778418 they have destroyed a rescue team setup that we have had going for some time
1778419 the sinister magic of a city that reveals its true colors at nigh

1778423 we are traveling the nation to highlight the hot air that comes out of so many politicians mouths when it comes to global warming
1778424 nobody better represents the hot air in the global warming debate than john edwards who traveled the state proposing much higher taxes and regulations on average citizens while be built a massive energy guzzling house in orange county
1778425 don knight orange county building plans examiner told cj that including the recreational building the edwardses home would be one of the largest in orange county
1778426 the lieutenant governor has criticized me in recent news reports for sending a letter to political action committees requesting a contribution
1778427 my request stated it would help me make constructive change to state government there was no promise of any political favors in return perdue on the other hand has a record of slipping special provisions in the budget to help special interests who give her large contributions she is part of the culture of arrogance and corruption i intend to change
1778428 the pac lady sitting in the smoke filled rooms making deals has no standing to criticize her opponent
1778429 it marks the first time that the rare fish a holdover from the last ice age has survived and reproduced in a new habitat
1778430 as the water in cijiawan river tends to be very turbid following typhoons the conservation center needs to store water in advance to ensure that fry being raised there can survive
1778431 the number of salmon in cijiawan river has declined by about 25 percent to some 1 500 because of tropical storm kamaelgi and typhoon fung wong
1778432 the percentage of university admission among twins is also 2 2 percent lower than that of children born individually
1778433 if history had not given us the jew the anti semite would have invented him
1778434 that dovbear just loves posting hyperlinks to stuff that many folks dont walk to talk about
1778435 hes trying to show that there are other facets to orthodox judaism that we dont all think one way and vote one way and hes occasionally entertaining when hes not being mean spirited
1778436 dovie is my best friend i love dovie i love him so much that im able to complain about him and bother him whenever i darn feel like it

1778441 notwithstanding his misguided politics i am amused by the postings of dovbear
1778442 its always interesting to watch people who have been incredibly successful in their own businesses work in a group made up of equally strong personalities it takes a special kind of leader who can effectively manage a team of veritable strangers and find the best way to get strong winning performances from them
1778443 i think more things should be done and the community should be aware of whats happening to us
1778444 i dont understand why they hate us why are they doing this to us
1778445 fortunately she wasnt seriously injured but nevertheless she would have been particularly traumatised by what was a very nasty incident
1778446 since racist incidents have been systematically recorded it appears that the main victims are somali and multiple heritage young people and that there has been and increase in the number of incidents relating to religion and belief since the london bombings
1778447 safety fears not only had an impact on the staying safe outcome but also on staying healthy and possibly achieving
1778448 natural examples of where community herding competition can take place
1778449 this same competition emerges within age cohorts such as middle aged individuals competing for investment vehicles to save for retirement
1778450 investment and prices may be distorted significantly from fundamentals as a result of this herding behavior
1778451 youd look good in pink soften that big bad time lord look of yours
1778452 to commemorate dramatic economic social and cultural achievements over the past 30 years
1778453 indifference to the god given rights of its own citizens
1778454 how can beijing host the olympics while underwriting genocide in sudan
1778455 what is everyone going to do about it and that means the athletes the hosts the sponsors and all responsible world leaders
1778456 it makes a statement thats sadly needed otherwise we forge ahead with a repeat of the 1936 nazi olympics there are many parallels
1778457 china is not committing genocide as the nazis did after 1936
1778458 has a chance to bring china further into the community of responsible nations
1778459 provoked so many ordinary chinese into a frenzy of defending china
1778460 the chinese are so angry because virtually all of them believe that the western protests have little to do with human rights
1778461 the chinese think the wests real motivation is to deny china the triumph it deserves for its enormous successes
1778462 it appeared to us this might be where they planned on settling big time
1778463 ive made my thoughts known pretty publicly that were not pleased with their lifestyle
1778464 we have to be wary because we know from past experience how people who are uninformed can get their minds rolling
1778465 i cant do a lot of physical work so i really enjoy coloring these for the children
1778466 i didnt want to be intimidated every time i went to the store or any time i did anything
1778467 you should tell them we like this little town and we are sorry that they dont like us
1778468 i wouldnt say this community is scared about what is going on i would say they are deeply concerned about what could be going on
1778469 ive had people tell me they cant fall asleep at night for fear there are victims of that in our county and they cant do anything
1778470 we all need to consider the effect on our property values
1778471 if they come in here en masse its a threat to our property values but also our ranching way of life it is almost like a gawd darn plague that you have to deal with
1778472 what we saw were very kind honest hard working people
1778473 not one person in our group in colorado is on welfare not one
1778474 until we can prove something criminal is going on we will try to be civil with them
1778475 then that hatewatch article came out and all of a sudden we had neighbors who thought we were horrible people
1778476 we just want to say we have the right to live here as much as anybody
1778477 companies marketing these unapproved products have not demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these drugs
1778478 a case in point no hydrocodone cough suppressant has been established as safe and effective for children under 6 years of age and some of these unapproved products carry labels with dosing instructions for children as young as 2 years of age
1778479 this is another example of the kinds of safety risks that warrant priority enforcement under our compliance policy guide
1778480 there are products on the market with inadequate safety information on their labeling improperly suggesting that the products may be used safely by very young children in addition these products may pose a higher risk of medication error than approved products these products need to come off the market until they meet fda approval standards
1778481 radio the human staffed labor intensive semitechnical medium thats known in this satellite age as terrestrial radio for decades has greeted us first thing in the morning accompanied us to work offered the latest news and weather alerts performed our favorite entertainment and made us feel like someone was sending friendly greetings to us out of the great anonymous ozone

1778485 no you dont get it i feel guilty about cheating on patty
1778486 you fuck really great next time youre in cleveland you look me up if you change your mind
1778487 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1778488 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1778489 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1778490 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1778491 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1778492 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1778493 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1778494 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1778495 steve buyer is choosing to play washington spin games to avoid facing the people and discussing the facts of his voting record
1778496 we have constituents regularly calling us and asking us to debate and we have accepted all of their invitations we have agreed to just about any format any date and any location but steve buyer refuses to commit to any specific public debates he says one thing and does nothing i think its time he offered the people of this district more than photo ops steve buyer has five weeks of vacation away from washington this august that could be used to meet with constituents for debates
1778497 there are a lot of conflicting stories about his performance and his votes particularly on veterans benefits there are a lot of questions about the facts given his record on the declining economy the 16 year absence of any cohesive energy policy and his proposed veterans tax i think its critical that we discuss the issues with our constituents
1778498 liberal fascism the secret history of the american left from mussolini to the politics of meaning
1778499 the good news is that were in a pretty good situation compared to a lot of transit authorities around the country
1778500 i am not proposing that we cut service for the new budget or to raise fares
1778501 so typical of the mexican community they have no idea how to educate their kids or how to get them away from drugs and violence but by gum they know how to get a street name changed they must be very proud of themselves i am soooooooo glad i was born white
1778502 lets throw out the rules well give loans to everyone and make way more money

1778506 john kreider was suffering from complications of his liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis
1778507 his blood group is o where the waiting time is very long as compared to other blood group patients on the waiting list he was becoming progressively more jaundiced in spite of the biliary stents being placed by our gastroenterologists and the risk with his liver disease was either the development of biliary cancer or a severe possibly fatal infection of his liver known as acute cholangitis
1778508 roadburn is very pleased to invite our spiritual brethren from neurosis to host a european version of their beyond the pale festival
1778509 on saturday april 25 neurosis will have complete freedom to invite all the bands and set the lineups for each of the stages over the years neurosis has exhibited an amazing commitment and dedication to the art of underground music something that we at roadburn understand and appreciate completely we are looking forward to the new ideas that they will bring to the festival as we feel neurosis are truly kindred spirits we look forward to uniting at roadburn 2009
1778510 the mission of beyond the pale is for us to honor the spirit and power of sound with people that we feel are kindred spirits we want to bring together a diverse group of people who push the envelope are truly original and have that unspeakable fire and inspiration flowing through their art
1778511 in our 23 years of existence we have had very few experiences that felt as right as our initial performance at roadburn in 2007
1778512 we fully support openmokos decision to publish the schematics of the u blox gps receivers
1778513 it is vitally important that developers have access to this data and it improves product quality going forward we think that more manufactures and more consumers will demand open architecture products with optimum performance
1778514 why should industry be afraid of opening up its design
1778515 schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success service and satisfaction in the market we believe our products would be incomplete without them
1778516 one of the freedoms we value the most is the freedom to explore to fully understand the details of complex systems to adapt and enhance them
1778517 we now take our commitment to openness to the next level by releasing our schematics to the public allowing anyone to find out how the system works and how to improve it
1778518 im sorry my actions caused you pain i hope this brings you the closure that you seek never harbor hate
1778519 under the circumstances its hard to talk about what comes next
1778520 but now more than ever its important to recall this is a case not just about one mexican national on death row in texas its also about ordinary americans who count on the protection of the consulate when they travel abroad to strange lands its about the reputation of the united states as a nation that adheres to the rule of law
1778521 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1778522 the woman is a phd is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1778523 these children spend most of their leisure time at home when they are supposed to be enjoying their youth

1778525 the lead song in race zara zara touch me resembles wangs deep in the bamboo grove
1778526 its rhythm and tempo are similar to that of deep in the bamboo grove the similarity is nearly 100 percent
1778527 the foreign office has got information about cancelation of the presidents visit
1778528 the cancelation of the china visit by president musharraf is an important development
1778529 given our special relationship and friendly ties with china it is unimaginable that a pakistani leader would cancel his visit and that too for a very important occasion for our ally china
1778530 it is up to the leaders to decide and they could chose to speak to media or issue a joint statement after the meeting
1778531 i am not concerned whether he is going or not it is up to him
1778532 president pervez musharraf is trying to harm the democratic process
1778533 it is not a question of what the coalition will do first as both are important issues and two sides of the same coin
1778534 we cannot just carve out thailand to put in the sky or move our land away

1778537 barring any unforeseen situation i dont think we are in for any surprise anwar ibrahim is going to win the election by a handsome margin
1778538 they will charge me and they will use this to humiliate and affect me in the by election
1778539 this charge is only possible on the orders from the prime minister who today faces a confidence crisis and leadership struggle
1778540 i will continue with my agenda i believe i will go to parliament and i will bring changes to this country
1778541 under malaysian laws you are only guilty when you are convicted otherwise being charged does not make you a convict or a guilty person
1778542 barring any unforeseen situation emerging in the next couple of weeks i dont think we are in for any surprise hes going to win the election by a handsome margin
1778543 the key thing will be the margin by which he wins and whether its bigger than his wifes margin as a barometer of how opposition support has improved or not since march
1778544 a non sustainable business model that involves the exchange of money primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme usually without any product or service being delivered

1778562 the meeting leader said i am not telling you how to vote but if the democrats win this bill will pass and you wont have a vote on whether you want a union
1778563 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
1778564 if anyone representing wal mart gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
1778565 we believe efca is a bad bill and we have been on record as opposing it for some time
1778566 we feel educating our associates about the bill is the right thing to do
1778567 we feel its important that our employee partners fully understand the implications that the employee free choice act could have on their work environment and benefits
1778568 weve always maintained the termination was not related to the union and that there was nothing unlawful about an answer provided an associate about merit pay
1778569 following the decision we were considering offering reinstatement but that is on hold since the union appealed the decision
1778570 this is a david and goliath confrontation but we believe well have enough stones in the sling to knock this out
1778571 surely henry viii and the split with the catholic church must rate very highly this above most opened britain up to a much wider thought process than being controlled by bigots

1778575 in sleeths stories of medical missions to central america anecdotes from the emergency room and narration of determined progress toward reducing his environmental footprint we glimpse a whole life formed by christ

1778800 a classic 1959 social psychology experiment demonstrates how and why we lie to ourselves understanding this experiment sheds a brilliant light on the dark world of our inner motivations the ground breaking social psychological experiment of festinger and carlsmith 1959 provides a central insight into the stories we tell ourselves about why we think and behave the way we do the experiment is filled with ingenious deception so the best way to understand it is to imagine you are taking part so sit back relax and travel back the time is 1959 and you are an undergraduate student at stanford university as part of your course you agree to take part in an experiment on measures of performance you are told the experiment will take two hours as you are required to act as an experimental subject for a certain number of hours in a year this will be two more of them out of the way little do you know the experiment will actually become a classic in social psychology and what will seem to you like accidents by the experimenters are all part of a carefully controlled deception for now though you are innocent once in the lab you are told the experiment is about how your expectations affect the actual experience of a task apparently there are two groups and in the other group they have been given a particular expectation about the study to instill the expectation subtly the participants in the other groups are informally briefed by a student who has apparently just completed the task in your group though youll do the task with no expectations perhaps you wonder why youre being told all this but nevertheless it makes it seem a bit more exciting now that you know some of the mechanics behind the experiment so you settle down to the first task you are given and quickly realise it is extremely boring you are asked to move some spools around in a box for half an hour then for the next half an hour you move pegs around a board frankly watching paint dry would have been preferable at the end of the tasks the experimenter thanks you for taking part then tells you that many other people find the task pretty interesting this is a little confusing the task was very boring whatever you let it pass then the experimenter looks a little embarrassed and starts to explain haltingly that theres been a cock up he says they need your help the participant coming in after you is in the other condition they mentioned before you did the task the condition in which they have an expectation before carrying out the task this expectation is that the task is actually really interesting unfortunately the person who usually sets up their expectation hasnt turned up so they ask if you wouldnt mind doing it not only that but they offer to pay you 1 because its 1959 and youre a student this is not completely insignificant for only a few minutes work and they tell you that they can use you again in the future it sounds like easy money so you agree to take part this is great what started out as a simple fulfilment of a course component has unearthed a little ready cash for you you are quickly introduced to the next participant who is about to do the same task you just completed as instructed you tell her that the task shes about to do is really interesting she smiles thanks you and disappears off into the test room you feel a pang of regret for getting her hopes up then the experimenter returns thanks you again and once again tells you that many people enjoy the task and hopes you found it interesting then you are ushered through to another room where you are interviewed about the experiment youve just done one of the questions asks you about how interesting the task was that you were given to do this makes you pause for a minute and think now it seems to you that the task wasnt as boring as you first thought you start to see how even the repetitive movements of the spools and pegs had a certain symmetrical beauty and it was all in the name of science after all this was a worthwhile endeavour and you hope the experimenters get some interesting results out of it the task still couldnt be classified as great fun but perhaps it wasnt that bad you figure that on reflection it wasnt as bad as you first thought you rate it moderately interesting after the experiment you go and talk to your friend who was also doing the experiment comparing notes you found that your experiences were almost identical except for one vital difference she was offered way more than you to brief the next student 20 this is when it first occurs to you that theres been some trickery at work here you ask her about the task with the spools and pegs sooooo boring i gave it the lowest rating possible
1778801 it wasnt that bad actually when you think about it it was pretty interesting

1778806 that would link this strain of anthrax to dr ivins lab
1778807 using new genome technology researchers looked at samples of cells from the victims to identify the kind of anthrax ames strain that killed them the scientist said they noticed very subtle differences in the dna of the strain used in the attacks than in other types of ames anthrax
1778808 the science is known as dna fingerprinting although any two samples of anthrax bacteria will likely share roughly the same dna structure there are tiny differences from sample to sample
1778809 the new genome technology that tracked down ivins was either not available or too expensive to use often until about three years ago
1778810 the dna sequence of the anthrax sent through the us mail in 2001 has been revealed and confirms suspicions that the bacteria originally came from a us military laboratory

1778859 i went in the subway sandwich shop and ordered two sandwiches and i paid almost 12 for the sandwich i did not get the sandwich made the way to be made the way i wanted to
1778860 he actually called 911 to tell us that he needed our assistance because his sandwich was improperly made
1778861 they locked the door on me they got the sandwiches i paid for inside the store im not leaving here until i got what i paid for im not going to sit and pay 12 or 10 for some sandwiches and not get what i paid for
1778862 then he calls a third time and wanted to know where police were once we arrived he was totally irrational

1778917 the international olympic committee relies on the international federations who are exclusively responsible for the eligibility of an athlete
1778918 they will feel stress if the journalists keep throwing questions like which medal do you think you can get they were trained in a closed environment even if we want to change it needs some time
1778919 the olympics are a great forum for me to use to get my message out
1778920 its a great thing for me to do im saying not to kill innocent animals theres nothing negative that goes into that
1778921 i go to the office in a swim suit im comfortable with shedding a few more items of clothing i dont think its too crazy or risque
1778922 you have concerns im not out here taking my clothes off were doing it in a very positive way
1778923 im doing it for all those animals who dont have a voice
1778924 i think some people were scared of what this might become
1778925 i think they tried censorship but it was not successful amanda didnt want her voice to be silenced
1778926 im hopeful things will change here but im not optimistic this is a message for the world
1778927 but things are changing five years ago you would never have considered doing things like this
1778928 i believe this honor belongs to the older generation of chinese athletes who have contributed to the development of our sport
1778929 the olympics give us international exposure when we need it most
1778930 but i think our chances are really just as good as anybody elses
1778931 a bit of battle does exist because the first gold medal means so much for our people
1778932 li is the best so it will be good to push her on her home soil
1778933 i am not nervous because for me every second is a bonus after my boy was born i just want to enjoy the olympics
1778934 i have got to the point where this is just farcical and simply unfair on the athletes who are clean and get there on their own merit
1778935 i have no doubts that when i line up next week i will look left and right and know the other girls arent all clean that is such a disgrace and ive lost all faith in the system because there are so many athletes who are slipping under the radar
1778936 thats not sport its plain cheating and we need to be vigilant in nailing those who cross the line athletics has been hit by several high profile doping scandals over the past few years
1778937 its a joke and again ive lost count of what ive missed out on because of drug cheats
1778938 certainly weve got 33 active exploration licences and were issuing or proposing to issue 14 more so thats the first step to make land available

1778940 if it takes another two weeks or two months to get a deal done i dont think its significant in terms of the overall time scale
1778941 the government of newfoundland and labradors right of approval dates back many decades and is somewhat unique in canadian universities in most other jurisdictions governments have entirely removed themselves from the process instead choosing a more appropriate involvement through arms length mechanisms such as governing boards
1778942 autonomy is vital if our university is to fulfill its commitments to the people of newfoundland and labrador and beyond
1778943 the board is concerned that governments non acceptance of the candidates and governments request that the search committee continue with its search before a formal recommendation could be made on the boards proposed appointee constitutes inappropriate interference in the normal process
1778944 the board is concerned that progress in the search for a new president will be severely impaired until such clarity is obtained
1778945 subsequent to those meetings government informed the search committee that the candidates were not acceptable and asked the search committee to expand its search and develop other names for consideration
1778946 this was a surprise to the search committee which had identified dr eddy campbell as its preferred candidate
1778947 these events have caused a significant delay in the work of the search committee

1778968 the strategic oil reserve exists for americas national security strategy not barack obamas election strategy
1778969 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1778970 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant you know they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true
1778971 because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1778972 i agree with the american automobile assn we should all inflate our tires
1778973 instead of calling on his partys leadership to return to congress and carve out an all of the above approach to americas energy crisis barack obama would rather tell commuters to inflate their car tires
1778974 you remember george bushs energy policy which was basically to turn to dick cheney and say here dick do something with this
1778975 and so dick in his inestimable wisdom decided hed meet with the renewable energy groups once and then hed meet with the oil and gas companies 40 times and so not surprisingly the laws he came up with were very good for the oil and gas companies but they werent so good for you
1778976 sen mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook hes offered a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy

1778983 i arranged a flash mob for nicholas ii on odnoklassniki ru
1778984 mass voting for stalin was being organized from several internet resources
1778985 more than 400 000 users of the social networking site vkontakte ru consider themselves monarchists and we are asking them to vote in support of our last tsar
1778986 he was a very good person kind but spineless that was a big minus
1778987 research says that the choice of stalin as name of russia is not possible
1778988 the majority will be affected by this show only when its on the air when they watch the show and see that stalin is winning imagine how many people will vote and start being engaged with the show
1778989 if you name this show great russians you actually are almost forced to deny stalin and lenin being part of that
1778990 on the other hand that makes the picture of your country biased by your political approach and that doesnt leave any discussion for the show

1778996 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
1778997 this is historically what happens whenever revolutionaries begin to take the oppression and suffering of their fellow beings seriously whether human or nonhuman its regrettable that certain scientists are willing to put their families at risk by choosing to do wasteful animal experiments in this day and age
1778998 we must not allow a violent minority to dictate the future of medicine
1778999 these are people who want to do violence and they cloak themselves in this kind of moral stance

1779003 self described liberals are most common within the ranks of those professors aged 50 64 who were teenagers or young adults in the 1960s
1779004 these findings with regard to age provide further support for the idea that in recent years the trend has been toward increasing moderatism

1779007 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1779008 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1779009 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated

1779035 for multilayer optical discs it has been difficult to obtain clear signals from each recording layer in a stable manner due to crosstalk from adjacent layers and transmission loss utilizing the optical disc production technology that it has developed in the dvd field pioneer solved these problems by among other things using a disc structure that can reduce crosstalk from adjacent layers resulting in a 16 layer optical disc that can playback high quality signals from every layer as for the read out system pioneer achieved stability in the playback of recorded signals by employing a wide range spherical aberration compensator and light receiving element that can read out weak signals at a high signal to noise ratio in the optical pick up mechanism since the optical specifications of the objective lens such as na numerical aperture are the same as those for the existing bd discs it is possible to maintain compatibility between the new 16 layer optical disc and the bd discs

1779247 i used to go to former manager jerry narron and say if im at 115 pitches in the seventh inning dont take me out

1779259 ik ken de kracht van andere ploegen niet over een aantal weken kan ik zeggen wie mijn favoriet is
1779260 al is onze selectie kwalitatief minder dan vorig seizoen vooral in de breedte we zijn daarom heel erg afhankelijk van blessures en schorsingen net als de meeste andere teams in de jupiler league bijna geen enkele club heeft een enorm brede selectie tot de beschikking als we van blessures en schorsingen gevrijwaard blijven kunnen we het goed gaan doen in tegenstelling tot veel andere clubs hebben wij de nodige spelers met eredivisie ervaring
1779261 voor het eerst sinds een aantal seizoenen is het moeilijk een kampioenskandidaat aan te geven
1779262 in mijn ogen komt een hele rits ploegen in aanmerking voor de titel vvv rkc waalwijk en excelsior hebben een streepje voor maar ook mvv zwolle go ahead eagles cambuur en wij kunnen stunten dat maakt komend seizoen in mijn ogen wel interessant ons doel is om bij de eerste vijf te eindigen en een periodetitel te pakken vorig seizoen lukte ons dat al direct aan het begin wat mij betreft pakken we nu de voorlaatste of laatste periodetitel zoals volendam deed dan heb je meer kans op promotie
1779263 maar de titel is in mijn ogen niet re el
1779264 een aantal clubs is op dit moment verder dan wij vorig seizoen had rkc de middelen en de spelers om kampioen te worden nu is dat toch wat anders
1779265 vvv heeft in mijn ogen veruit de beste selectie veel spelers zijn gebleven en met ruben schaken frank van kouwen en marnix kolder hebben ze ook drie sterke voetballers erbij gekregen verder zal cambuur vermoedelijk beter presteren dan vorig seizoen
1779266 met michael jansen paul beekmans ruud ter heide en danny guijt hebben we ons aanzienlijk versterkt onze doelstelling is om bij de eerste tien te eindigen en ons te plaatsen voor de play offs

1779275 jennifer crisler executive director of family equality council had asked both candidates to outline their plan to

1779288 one tends to assume that the cat performs the movement pattern of prey catching for the sake of eating only that this is not so can be demonstrated experimentally leyhausen gave to cats which were keen hunters one mouse after the other and observed the order in which the part actions of preying and eating disappeared first the cat stopped eating but killed a few more mice leaving them untouched next the killing bite disappeared but the cat continued to stalk and to catch the mice later still when the movement pattern of catching was exhausted the cat still did not stop stalking the mice an indeed in so doing it always chose those farthest away in the opposite corner of the room and ignored those that ran over its forepaws

1779292 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1779293 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference

1779307 they were pretty good at taking pitches and getting swings
1779308 he threw well but they centered some balls they hit two strike pitches and curves that he left over the plate that shouldnt have been there
1779309 he waved off some change ups and tried to sneak a fastball inside and a fastball outside that he left over the plate
1779310 we killed a lot of worms tonight topped a lot of balls

1779377 there are things that you could do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated a simple thing we could save all the oil that theyre talking about saving from drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups you could actually save just as much
1779378 this is unbelievable my friends this is laughable of course but its stupid it is stupid
1779379 two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is the other things is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumpltion by 3 4 its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

1779384 i had been in the sia the irish reserves for a few years and had seen what it was like in the irish army but it just seems a bit quiet over there and theres not a lot going on
1779385 the english army has a lot more to offer i can go on to further education maybe after a few years and there are plenty of options for combat tours going to iraq afghanistan or other areas like that
1779386 i think it will give me a personal sense of achievement to come home from these places and say to myself i did that

1779388 i dont know anyone in the british army i just decided to join on my own
1779389 i dont think there will be any serious problems about me joining there might be one or two people saying something but i cant see myself getting too much grief really
1779390 historically there is nothing new in young men and women from the south joining the army
1779391 but its fair to say that for many years the numbers were in decline
1779392 however from 2003 onwards we have seen real growth in those joining
1779393 similarly given the current strong and vibrant political relations between north and south there is less of a stigma in telling your friends and family that youve joined
1779394 perhaps we are seeing old prejudices and preconceptions being put to one side or erased

1779424 music for me is neither something that i create nor a form of self expression all kinds of sounds exist everywhere around us and my performances solely consist of picking up these sounds like a radio tuner and playing them so that people can hear them however maybe because my reception is somewhat off i am unable to perfectly reproduce these sounds that is why i spend my days rehearsing where do these sounds come from who is sending them out that is not something for me to know and neither is there any way that i could find out i simply believe that they come from the cosmos maybe other people would call god the source since i was a small child i have been prone to hearing ringing sounds in my ears and other sound phantasms at the time i believed that these were messages aimed directly at me from a ufo and so i would gaze up at the sky but once i started playing music myself i came to feel that these noises were a kind of pure sound and i promised myself that one day i would be able to play those sounds myself it is only recently that i have begun to feel that i have been able to come close to reproducing these sounds in my solo guitar work and in my inui project however in june of 1999 i finally discovered my own cosmos and i experienced an instant of total union with it that cosmos is still tiny in size although any cosmos can by its very nature be infinitely huge or infinitely small the energy and vibrations contained within that it far exceeded my imagination in scope and beauty i can only describe the miraculous instant when my cosmos accepted my consciousness as magic

1779656 he was amazing so hes certainly a name that had been talked about as well
1779657 do you think if the middleman had been nakeder wed have a higher audience on the show
1779658 we were working on a 13th episode and we came to an arrangement with the network to throw an extra day at this 12th episode and some extra money in exchange for the 13th episode

1779663 the fate of the show is uncertain and thats really no secret i thought a conclusive note that states what the show is about was a better way to end the first season and go into the possibility of a second season or perhaps not the possibility of a second season
1779664 that took a look at the script and said we want to make this show exactly the way you want to make it doing 12 episodes that are my vision as opposed to 129 that are compromised and watered down is priceless
1779665 the love the show they want the show to succeed
1779666 if abc family decides this is not a show that is right now as compatible with his brand as it could be
1779667 and if they decide to take it elsewhere im on board

1779766 what we are seeing in the rural regions including south canterbury is the continuation of the spending momentum that has been there for some years whereas in the cities it has just fallen away people in the cities have just put their hand in their pocket and are not spending

1779769 anyone involved in the housing industry real estate agents lawyers builders they are worried about their jobs let alone whether they can pay the bills
1779770 the likelihood is over the next couple of years we will see a lower currency and more generally that will support the rural sector
1779771 the challenge is to get some more efficiencies in the economy in general and i think that challenge is going to be greater in the cities than on the farm

1779779 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some white people to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work in plain english obama means why settle for a little cash i hope to ride white guilt to the white house and beyond
