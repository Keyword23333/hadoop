3660028 the independence and effectiveness of external audits in new jersey cannot be trusted unless changes are made
3660029 auditors probably shouldnt be in the business of writing checks in campaign season
3660030 these are professionals and we feel they do a very very good job
3660031 you need to have an auditor who is independent and has the right incentives to scrutinize the units books and records and not an audit firm thats focused purely on maintaining the contractual relationship for as long a term as possible
3660032 it probably is a good idea to have a new set of eyes looking at your books

3660039 roll it down the hill and see if it crashes
3660040 roll it down the hill and see if it crashes
3660041 pretty complimentary review and ive been spotting a lot of positive things being written about bands with a similar angle and i think thats pretty cool because i generally like this kind of music
3660042 i dont make experimental music i do the experiments first then i write the music
3660043 the stuff thats really worth investing in as a listener is the kind of music that bands like dream theater and enchant are doing
3660044 i like his lyrics its almost like hes a poet or something
3660045 perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add but when there is nothing left to take away
3660046 the state of mississippi gets one nod as laboratory site
3660047 clarifications on cool are to be issued by the usda
3660048 for by him all things were created in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through him and for him and he is before all things
3660049 somebody help him up nah on second thought fuck it leave him there
3660050 you know i like your music but ya know its mighty disrespectful of you guys to come out here on our corner where were trying to sell flowers
3660051 playing for a bunch of our close friends in our hometown

3660053 countries that neighbor russia will think deeply about how to protect themselves how to guarantee security
3660054 the ability and the readiness to use force that russia has demonstrated shows that russia is a very serious power now
3660055 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3660056 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions
3660057 countries that neighbor russia will think deeply about how to protect themselves how to guarantee security
3660058 the ability and the readiness to use force that russia has demonstrated shows that russia is a very serious power now
3660059 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3660060 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions
3660061 we have not achieved peace yet but we have achieved a provisional cease fire
3660062 i do not really know what will happen but i am convinced that he will not change the team that progressed in the intertoto cup
3660063 i think that i will begin on the bench that is my view but it would not worry me at all
3660064 i did not know how to even pronounce the name but when you hear the reports you begin to learn things slowly and what history the club has
3660065 now i know what a great history hajduk have and i believe it was one of the most difficult draws we could have been given
3660066 the first game at home will be very important because it will show us whether we are capable of progressing or not a victory of any kind will allow us to go to croatia feeling calmer
3660067 lotina talked to me and said that he wanted to see me play on the wing in pre season as back up for filipe and i just worked hard and go where he wants me to
3660068 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
3660069 what with the summer holidays weve been noticing a creeping increase in some of our criminal damages in sleaford town
3660070 some teenagers are being allowed out all night which really isnt safe you have to ask yourself after places are shut in sleaford in the early evening where exactly are they going
3660071 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3660072 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people
3660073 if you dont risk you dont get to drink champagne
3660074 i was pretty nervous i just let my nerves get to me the wait seemed like forever
3660075 this erotic romance by ms da costa is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure to read and i am looking forward to reading many more by her
3660076 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
3660077 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
3660078 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
3660079 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
3660080 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
3660081 i would have stayed up all night long to finish reading this book i just cant get enough of portia da costa
3660082 continuum is an intelligent articulate foray into an erotic world lurking just beneath our civilised society
3660083 witty engaging narrative strong characters and description so vivid the scenes rise three dimensionally from the page
3660084 its every parents worst nightmare and you just dont expect it to happen in your own neighbourhood its so lucky the wee girl was with her friend who managed to cause such a fuss that the man panicked and fled
3660085 all sorts of rumours have been flying around and if what the wee girls says is true then its really worrying police have been round the doors asking questions but we havent heard anything since
3660086 there is no evidence to suggest this was an abduction attempt and at this stage it is being treated as an assault we would ask anyone with any information to get in touch
3660087 im disappointed with the referees performance the game had just gone ten minutes and the ref booked paul for swearing at him and then i think he booked him again for a similar thing
3660088 even speaking to the cambuslang team at the end of the game they agreed that it spoiled the match
3660089 but overall the boys put in a great effort and even though we were down to 10 men we looked comfortable at times
3660090 we will go out to win our next two games and see what happens we are not out of it yet
3660091 im hoping to have ross come in to the team for good this week
3660092 he played on saturday and he looks like a good player
3660093 hes very comfortable on the ball and has a good touch so we will be hoping he can fit into our system for the coming games
3660094 obviously we will look to strengthen the squad if it is possible
3660095 if the right player comes along then we might do something but at the moment it is just ross we have coming in

3660101 cameroon will put us under pressure in terms of physical strength and will play to win they wont make any calculations because it just isnt in their attitude to football
3660102 i am very sorry for rocchi as he was our star player
3660103 various clubs in england have been asking about the player but we have yet to receive an official offer
3660104 we are not ruling out a transfer to a club in saudi arabia
3660105 i was urgently needed by the gaffer john hughes so i thought i had done something wrong and i was waiting for a caning i could not believe it i thought it was a wind up at first so i am very surprised
3660106 i became aware that kris could qualify for scotland a few months ago
3660107 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest
3660108 i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability and maybe we have lack width in the squad
3660109 put on the lord jesus and make no provision for the flesh

3660113 the olympics is the pinnacle of our sport and its a great feeling to be part of the british team
3660114 im just hoping to do my best when the time comes and i will be looking to produce more of the kind of performances ive been recording all year
3660115 i think i can run around 13 4 seconds for the event maybe 13 5 and if i do that i cant be disappointed with how i perform
3660116 even the final might be asking too much of allan right now
3660117 the target for him is to do a personal best and if he manages to do that in the biggest pressure situation in our sport then ill be happy with that result
3660118 ohio voting law may be a boon for obama supporters

3660166 a change of only a few percent in the average speed of the batted ball which can reasonably be expected from steroid use is enough to increase home run production by at least 50 percent
3660167 that is enough to have a meaningful effect on the success of a pitcher but it is not nearly as dramatic as the effects on home run production

3660171 fans dont really care how their teams win they arent moral universalists they dont care about being fair to the other guys in the abstract fans oppose cheating they may even oppose cheating by their own team since the team could get caught thus eliciting penalties that outweigh any potential gain they may also fear the psychological penalties if your team wins but people think it cheated its harder to do a victory dance around the office watercooler but fearing the consequences of cheating is a far cry from opposing it because its wrong when the refs go to review a close play fans dont sit there thinking i hope theyll make the right call they pray that the call goes their way according to a 1999 study by psychologists at murray state a significant minority of fans if guaranteed anonymity would even support injuring an opposing player or coach in 1940 the cornell football team forfeited a victory after realizing that it had been mistakenly given an extra play if a coach did that today sports writers would declare him a saint and his teams fans would boil him in oil

3660204 our society and its educational institutions seem to have lost sight of the basic purposes of schooling and of the high expectations and disciplined effort needed to attain them if an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on america the mediocre educational performance that exists today we might well have viewed it as an act of war as it stands we have allowed this to happen to ourselves we have in effect been committing an act of unthinking unilateral educational disarmament each generation of americans has outstripped its parents in education in literacy and in economic attainment for the first time in the history of our country the educational skills of one generation will not surpass will not equal will not even approach those of their parents

3660237 the independence and effectiveness of external audits in new jersey cannot be trusted unless changes are made
3660238 auditors probably shouldnt be in the business of writing checks in campaign season
3660239 these are professionals and we feel they do a very very good job
3660240 you need to have an auditor who is independent and has the right incentives to scrutinize the units books and records and not an audit firm thats focused purely on maintaining the contractual relationship for as long a term as possible
3660241 it probably is a good idea to have a new set of eyes looking at your books

3660269 i used to love to watch my grandmother put on her perfume
3660270 shed blot a little dab behind her ears it was such a classy ritual
3660271 these fragrances are more than doubling in volume while the market is declining
3660272 they are doing a good job at attracting the trendsetter customer who is looking to try out different things
3660273 there is a real passionate person out there who buys a lot of fragrances and knows when everything is out before it actually comes out
3660274 i have an overly sensitive nose and i dont like most scents
3660275 but this i really like its light it smells fresh its like it belongs on me
3660276 she had a very precise idea about the notes in her perfume
3660277 the fragrance she asked me to make was in a completely different range of my usual creations

3660287 it seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months

3660295 they target certain players and its part of my job to make sure he doesnt react
3660296 i want to leave city no question it is heartbreaking every time you dont play and one year sitting on the bench would not be good for my development
3660297 i have been trying to leave for a while because last season the week after i signed a contract i was told i wasnt playing
3660298 ive been told there is no chance of me leaving but i want to play first team football
3660299 we asked what any deal would cost and then we tried to be creative with it
3660300 we have always been looking at hyland but there are complications with the work permit situation
3660301 at the moment he fails to satisfy the criteria he has played in friendly matches but they have to be competitive so do not count
3660302 its a shame because he is very much one for the future and a player we are interested in
3660303 we are not even sure when we will find out the outcome its a case of how long is a piece of string
3660304 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players

3660329 a lot of this has caught the americans by surprise
3660330 politicians have been on the project of supporting democracy in the former soviet union without thinking of the impact in russia now were seeing a reaction
3660331 but now that it has come up against major opposition i think the inability of the u s to mount an effective response is going to call into question washingtons ability to push back
3660332 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable

3660339 i think that the bucharest communique stands the allies have said in bucharest that one day georgia will join nato
3660340 in the discussion today a number of allies suggested there could not be business as usual we think we need to look at how we are working with russia
3660341 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict

3660349 if our private health insurance system depends on one capped incentive or penalty to survive then weve got far more serious problems than people let on
3660350 i think its a much more delicate and complex balance than people are painting
3660351 we are happy to look at changes that might enable insurers to provide more attractive products
3660352 there are some regulatory constraints that are often raised with us
3660353 there is plenty of fertile ground for ensuring that there are more attractive products for consumers which i think ultimately is the most important way to attract people into private health insurance than a tax penalty
3660354 not one of those attacked so far has been put out of operation
3660355 here early in the battle we get a glimpse of fuddled thinking at the highest level in the german camp
3660356 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3660357 i am delighted with the win and the performance and the way we played but its only one win and we wont get carried away weve tried to put together a committed honest and hard working team allied with the talent that was on show here weve got a genuine bunch here and were all growing together but this is only one win and were now concentrating on gillingham on saturday which is already a massive game for us
3660358 the players should be embarrassed i can defend them for the first half performance but certainly not for the second half we conceded from two more set pieces and also got another nil and thats worrying
3660359 we have had some criticism but these are decent players we have here and this is a big step for us you can see the relief in our dressing room and you could hear the relief in our supporters who stayed with us when we went behind and over 10 000 turning up is great testament to them
3660360 the clubs reborn said a delighted manager mark robins its a totally different club to what it was last season and when you talk about a club being reborn thats exactly whats happened at rotherham so well take that on and use this to our advantage because there are good things going to be happening here
3660361 the players have got to take credit for that because we didnt know wed be shooting penalties into the kop end and it proved to be a bit more stressful for the wednesday players we had a feeling for reuben at the end so we stuck him down to take the last one and he put it away
3660362 i honestly felt that if wed got the first goal we would have been alright i felt that was crucial for the young players
3660363 but having said all of that we still lost 1 0 at home to yeovil and we shouldnt have done that with the players that were on show so there are a few question marks about a few squad members and only they can answer it from here on in
3660364 we are hugely disappointed to go out of the cup at this stage
3660365 yet again we shot ourselves in the foot by creating chances and not taking them we need to remedy that very quickly because we had the same problem on saturday where we were creating chances but not scoring that puts huge pressure on the defence to keep a clean sheet
3660366 defensively i think the boys have performed very well its just the boys at the top of the field who are not taking the chances the boys who are missing the chances are taking them in training but that doesnt count
3660367 the players have been left in no uncertain terms that is not acceptable
3660368 if you dont work hard for me at this football club then you wont be at this football club end of story
3660369 i thank you for drawing my attention to this compliance issue
3660370 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurized assets remained limited in the second quarter
3660371 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009
3660372 you have to be realistic and say we nearly got relegated last season and so we werent good enough
3660373 you hope you wont have the same problems mid table mediocrity would not be the end of the world this season to say were going to jump into the european places is a bit naive you cant go from being a relegation side into a uefa cup side overnight very rarely does that happen
3660374 we have to mix our game up more than we did in the first two thirds of last season continued murphy
3660375 lawrie did play the long ball game and we became a bit one dimensional which is easy to play against
3660376 roy is honest articulate hes been around hes experienced and very calm he doesnt get carried away and hes not one of those managers who goes mad when the press has a go at him
3660377 he doesnt tell us how great we are when weve won a game and he keeps everything on an even keel that was reflected in our performances towards the end of last season
3660378 we never got flustered we never panicked and we won quite a few games late on that was partly because he believed in us and we believed in what we trying to do under him

3660418 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3660419 ik merkte het bij een optreden we speelden een volksliedje waarbij ik een toon wat langer moest aanhouden ik hield hem v l te lang vast omdat ik de kracht miste om mijn vinger van de toets af te halen op weg naar huis spraken we daarna af dat coby voorlopig die lastige stukjes even voor haar rekening zou nemen want het was maar tijdelijk dacht ik
3660420 uiteindelijk ben ik toch maar naar de dokter gegaan ik dacht hup een paar pillen en we gaan weer verder het werd een tournee langs ziekenhuizen en specialisten tot ik bij een professor kwam die zei dat het een spierziekte was hij bracht het heel nuchter en zei er meteen bij dat het snel achteruit zou gaan dat ik in een rolstoel terecht zou komen en dat ik waarschijnlijk een keer door verstikking om het leven zou komen ik dacht eerst die man praat maar wat dit kan toch niet
3660421 maar de buurman zag me hij betrapte me eigenlijk toen was ik er doorheen ook
3660422 wij kenden ons plafond bij ons ging het om volksmuziek niet meer en niet minder het publiek ziet een accordeon nu eenmaal als een bruiloftsinstrument aan een piano of een viool hangt veel meer status dan weet je dat je als accordeonist altijd extra moet knokken voor waardering als we zon zaal dan weer voor ons hadden gewonnen voelde dat geweldig
3660423 de eerste jaren nadat we stopten konden we onze eigen cds niet draaien het was te pijnlijk de sfeer van de optredens de mensen om je heen de waardering dat wil je niet kwijt
3660424 als ik naar ons huis en onze gouden platen kijk denk ik dat hebben we toch maar mooi bij elkaar gespeeld met die twee accordeonnetjes
3660425 dan ben je eraan gewend tegenslag achter een glimlach te verschuilen
3660426 gewoon optreden waarschijnlijk zolang volle zalen erom zouden vragen tenminste want je moet er niet aan denken dat je eindigt met optredens in een verpleeghuis dat je daar staat te spelen voor oudjes die door hun kinderen op de eerste rij zijn gezet terwijl oma zelf liever een dutje doet
3660427 als we een gezin hadden willen hebben hadden we nooit samen de stap naar duitsland kunnen zetten kinderen vielen niet te combineren met ons werk daar
3660428 hadden we die stap over de grens toen niet gezet hadden we nu met die rolstoel misschien op een flatje gezeten of in een tehuis
3660429 vooral vragen ons steeds weer om overal bij te zijn met die rolstoel is dat gewoon niet te doen en als je geen glaasje kunt aanpakken is het ook niet leuk meer

3660436 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3660437 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant officense and undermine respect for the law
3660438 also the mtdna genome is much smaller than the nuclear genome

3660441 if there were only a few small bands of neanderthals barely hanging on then any change to their way of life could have been enough to drive them to extinction
3660442 one obvious change would have been the introduction of another large hominid modern humans
3660443 the study shows that at least for the maternal lineage there are no traceable genetic markers that suggest admixture of neanderthals and modern humans
3660444 the goal is to defeat obama i dont want obama to be in office
3660445 we didnt see any new looting at the eight sites which was really very very encouraging
3660446 if there was major recent looting there we would have expected to find it
3660447 but i didnt see anything that was there in late 2003 or early 2004
3660448 tens of thousands of military boots tramping over an archaeological site is not what we want
3660449 the ongoing problem is not so much looting or military damage it is the fact that these sites have faced 30 years of neglect
3660450 the lack of resources for the iraqi department of antiquities means they simply havent been able to inspect the sites or do conservation or restoration work
3660451 if you ask will it not be good that if before impeachment an honourable exit should be worked out my answer would be yes it could be a good option
3660452 when he was asked how musharraf would avoid the impeachment vote he declined to reply
3660453 only leaves him the options of resigning or dissolving parliament or both
3660454 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3660455 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3660456 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3660457 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3660458 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3660459 we designed the computer simulations to show that as the ocean temperature increased hurricanes would form more rapidly and easily even in the presence of wind shear instead we got exactly the opposite result as the water temperature increased the effectiveness of the wind shear in suppressing hurricane formation actually became greater
3660460 the additional aspect that our method offers is a much more accurate picture of the process of tropical storm and hurricane formation as compared to the global models
3660461 although it is at an early stage if results in patients are good it could be very important especially because these drugs would not have to be approved by the national institute for health and clinical excellence

3660483 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles

3660485 all our thoughts are with his family at this time
3660486 john macdougall gave more than thirty years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convenor of fife council and then member of parliament for central fife and he will be remembered as a true servant of
3660487 a very popular diligent local member of parliament he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played
3660488 over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine and i visited him on monday
3660489 our heartfelt condolences go to his widow cathy to his son and daughter scott and julie and to his mother and sister
3660490 we wanted to cheer her up and there arent many things you can give to someone who is ill
3660491 i thought it was taking away something very important from someone who wasnt very well if i was on a ward id like to receive cards
3660492 we had never heard of this before and can only assume it is due to any bugs in the flowers or vases being knocked over
3660493 we asked if they could be left in a dayroom or nurses quarters but this was also rejected and they wouldnt dispose of them so the alternative was to bin them or bring them home
3660494 frenchay is a wonderful hospital but it seems a shame people cant receive cards or flowers they could maybe put the cards and flowers in an area away from the beds
3660495 many older people find get well cards to be a reassuring and pleasant distraction from illness while in hospital
3660496 while we fully understand the paramount importance of keeping hospital wards clean and tidy we cant help wondering whether this isnt a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut we would hope that with a bit of flexible thinking it would be possible to allow older people to recover with appropriate support from family and friends
3660497 we dont prevent patients displaying get well cards on the wards
3660498 however maintaining a clean environment and reducing infection is this trusts number one priority
3660499 it is particularly important that the area around the patients bed is kept as clean as possible and is free of clutter so our cleaners can get complete access
3660500 responsibility for cleanliness lies with the sister in charge on each ward and if they feel cards on display by a patients bedside are getting in the way of domestic staff they will ask them to be taken down
3660501 we hope this particular patient and their family understand the very good reasons why they were asked to do this
3660502 when i came yesterday the guy asked me to come back with all my documents and he said that you guys close at 3 now its only 2 57 and you tell me that i cant go in
3660503 if its for inquiries or anything else well let you in but for submission cannot
3660504 i rushed all the way here just to arrive before three and you guys are telling me i cant go in its not even three yet and the guy said before three
3660505 yesterday when i came your colleague told me that i had insufficient documents so i had to get everything done again and rush here before 3 as he told me that you guys close at 3 when i got here your guards said i was too late and didnt want to let me in how can i be not angry
3660506 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made
3660507 however a citation was written and that is not public record under rule 12
3660508 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3660509 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3660510 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3660511 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3660512 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3660513 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3660514 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3660515 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3660516 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3660517 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3660518 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3660519 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3660520 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss

3660626 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
3660627 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
3660628 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it

3660645 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing
3660646 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying
3660647 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia

3660650 het wegwerken van de achterstand zal nog enkele dagen in beslag nemen het gaat vooral om duizenden bagagestukken van passagiers die vertrokken zijn en die nog op de plaats van bestemming moeten worden gebracht het probleem stelt zich veel minder voor vluchten die op zaventem toekwamen vermits vele van die vluchten omgeleid werden naar andere luchthavens

3660662 venmore supports epcs as they provide really useful information for both tenants and landlords however we would urge landlords and tenants to take professional advice from a letting firm on epcs they could be time consuming and expensive
3660663 providing the epc process is properly managed by a letting agent there should be little conflict between tenant and landlord however those renting properties built in the 1960s compared to those built in 1990s and upwards are obviously going to be more effected by the epc ruling

3660667 for itc rs 175 to about rs 210 212 is the range thats traveling in so one need to buy at the lower end of the range on a bad day
3660668 for nagarjuna fertilisers rs 33 34 is a strong support and the upward side of the range is about rs 58 60 so one needs to get off at those higher levels and then try to enter when these stocks react and come back to lower levels

3660674 we have an investment in axis bank and recommended to our clients i am positive on it last three four quarters the results coming out have been exceptionally good at current levels more or less fairly valued unless we have another fantastic result coming out for the september quarter and any buy decisions would be at slightly lower levels maybe 10 15 below these current levels so the advice to the investors would be to hold on if one is a long term investor if one has a 1 1 5 year outlook even from the current prices or ones holding cost one should expect 25 30 kind of a return
3660675 if its a bit of a trading pick then one could look at exiting off and then trying to acquire it at lower levels my sense is that a bit of top has got created in axis and there is some resistance around rs 750 770 level maybe the stock could go below rs 700 at which point of time it would be quite interesting assuming that some of the threats like oil crises and inflation interest rates are still under control

3660686 the world is the way we say it is because were men and you will accept what we have to say without question or you will get the hell out of our room
3660687 act respectful and you will be treated with respect dont believe anything we say do the research for yourself go to the sources we give you go to your own sources look at the historical facts see what can and cannot be proved dont take
3660688 ninety percent of girls reported experiencing sexual harassment at least once specifically 67 percent of girls reported receiving unwanted romantic attention 62 percent were exposed to demeaning gender related comments 58 percent were teased because of their appearance 52 percent received unwanted physical contact and 25 percent were bullied or threatened with harm by a male 52 percent of girls also reported receiving discouraging gender based comments on the math science and computer abilities usually from male peers and 76 percent of girls reported sexist comments on their athletic abilities again predominantly from male peers
3660689 its sexual harassment if hes broke ugly and works in the mailroom
3660690 women were oppressed for years and years and if now some men are then blah blah blah
3660691 ninety percent of girls reported experiencing sexual harassment at least once specifically 67 percent of girls reported receiving unwanted romantic attention 62 percent were exposed to demeaning gender related comments 58 percent were teased because of their appearance 52 percent received unwanted physical contact and 25 percent were bullied or threatened with harm by a male
3660692 had kelly been a man i probably would have let this go but colluding ass women get on my nerves
3660693 ninety percent of girls reported experiencing sexual harassment at least once specifically 67 percent of girls reported receiving unwanted romantic attention 62 percent were exposed to demeaning gender related comments 58 percent were teased because of their appearance 52 percent received unwanted physical contact and 25 percent were bullied or threatened with harm by a male 52 percent of girls also reported receiving discouraging gender based comments on the math science and computer abilities usually from male peers and 76 percent of girls reported sexist comments on their athletic abilities again predominantly from male peers

3660699 we would be looking at numbers that support a contention that women as a class are as capable as men as a class and furthermore willing to pull their weight in the service
3660700 please leave us out we need funding and we wont get it if we say something against the feminist our research and their research doesnt even get matched they leave us alone and we leave them alone
3660701 oh yeah it was bad i saw some of it only because my husband wanted to watch sport
3660702 flints gunner once again putting words in my mouth i do not hate men you perhaps but not men in general
3660703 and why site sic an article that is 4 years old
3660704 everyone is equal and we will all work for enjoyment at our own pace and no more war and no more poverty blah blah blah
3660705 everyone is equal and we will all work for enjoyment at our own pace and no more war and no more poverty blah blah blah
3660706 a small number of men have sex with whichever women they fancy you wouldnt know it from public discourse but a large number possibly a majority of men have very little access to sex and reproduction at all and when they do they have very little stake in the families that result
3660707 did you know that 85 of the deaths from cervical cancer in the last count could have been prevented if the women had chosen to get a pap smear
3660708 83 of our youth in trouble according to the youth court judges are from fatherless homes the same are in the prisons most of the feminists were silenced because they got it wrong they couldnt feminise the boys because the boys chose to look for male role models
3660709 neither of you know what it is like to really love and sadly i carry this load alone till others get it
3660710 some have mental disorders some are homosexuals and some just have scars
3660711 considering the opportunities in the offshore e amp p and bsls expansion plans we expect its sales to grow at a cagr of 47 and pat to grow at a cagr of 29 from fy08 to fy10e at the cmp of rs 310 bsl is trading at 8x its fy09e eps and 5 6x its fy10e eps we initiate coverage on bharati shipyard limited with buy recommendation and a target price of rs 390 which is equivalent to a forward p e of 7x to its fy10e eps of rs 55 7
3660712 from a trading perspective rs 550 600 is a buy zone for axis bank and probably around rs 800 820 is a good sell zone but from a long term perspective today banking has lots of bad news inflation higher interest rates when interest rates starts declining these stocks will come back and again outperform so if one is willing to wait and take that kind of a view then probably he she has a lot more upside than from a trading view where this stock is already rallied from about rs 550 to rs 800 so one may not have much on the table left from a trading point of view but longer term these stocks looks good
3660713 then probably you will get hit by almost 2 3 if you are an irr

3660722 efcc has more petition against nddc officials than any other government officials in the region and we welcome it img was the first group to ask nddc board members to declare their assets in 2002 but to say a criminal allegation against the chairman is enough to sack the entire board is a mere display of political hatred among the elites ready to destabilise the good works of the commission
3660723 the chairman must face the law over the allegations against him the police report says the suspended chairman threatened the lives of co board members because they allegedly refused to cooperate with him
3660724 we salute the courage of the president for immediately replacing the former chairman with the akwa ibom representative in the commission so that nddc activities will not be distracted by confusionists

3660752 when we took this thing over from the bowl it was a passing of the guard
3660753 it wasnt a loss of life it was just a change of life ill forever be grateful to those coaches for what they did for this school and the bowl game they let me live the american dream and i wish nothing but the best for rich and all the guys
3660754 there are definitely some fans that hate him thats their opinion
3660755 i think we all got caught up in the mix of what was really going on there we kept on eye on what michigan was doing a little bit
3660756 the proof in the pudding that he should be the next coach was getting them to the game
3660757 he calmed them down which they needed calming down after getting shellshocked like they did he got them focused he got them prepared to play that game
3660758 even though coach rod preached a lot about having a family atmosphere the guys feel that its more like a family atmosphere and coach stewart is a father figure to them
3660759 coach stew is laid back hes nice and hes funny and he knows when to be serious and he knows when to joke
3660760 coach rod hes a good coach i dont have anything bad to say about him i enjoyed four great years under his tutelage
3660761 we cant live on last years fiesta bowl victory weve got to look forward to whats next
3660762 i hit the weight room my freshman year and i kind of got hooked on it and i kept in there and here i am
3660763 i know a lot of guys that i have worked with that have inspired me to do what i do
3660764 josh is an awful nice young man and id like to see good things happen to him as i would for all the others
3660765 hes received a little bit of attention and now its up to him to be sure to keep their attention up
3660766 hes a big boy you wont find many much bigger than him not being as athletic as he is
3660767 its been amazing just being a part of something bigger than yourself every year year in and out
3660768 its something most people dont get to be a part of because they dont want to commit to the game so its something special that few people get to be
3660769 im been waiting my whole life to play this year so im pretty excited about it
3660770 we dont have a lot of numbers but we have a lot of guys that can help us out and help us win so im excited about it
3660771 i have played football with all of the seniors since pee wee so we have been playing forever together
3660772 weve been in the weight room since last season ended pretty much and weve got a lot of guys that are pretty strong
3660773 strength doesnt always translate to a win but it helps
3660774 we should have no problem at all running the ball really
3660775 theyve all been in the weight room all summer with myself so weve worked pretty hard this offseason trying to get where we want to be
3660776 at the beginning of every season you want to get to that final point and that state championship and you want to win that obviously
3660777 were going to take it one game at a time and do what we can do to this season
3660778 weve talked about what he has to do he has to control along with the other six with him
3660779 theyve got to control the line of scrimmage and he understands that
3660780 he cant take any plays off hes got to be going full tilt every time the ball is snapped
3660781 the team went through some battles together but that made us closer through the course of the season
3660782 richlands was a big game for us that really got us rolling pretty good
3660783 it was just a matter of us coming together through the games at the beginning and we didnt do that obviously the first couple of games
3660784 we have a couple of opponents starting off that are very good quality opponents
3660785 coach always tells us its not where you start its where you end up and i really do think we believe that this year
3660786 weve put in a couple of new things this year and i really do like the way the team is going
3660787 weve got a couple of guys that could have played for us last year at linebacker that have stepped up this year
3660788 i think weve got some new safeties in the secondary but i think the defense is going to be pretty good
3660789 it was nice to have someone like tyler last year but this year i dont think we should have the one guy that stands out
3660790 as long as we keep that mentality that one person is not going to do it and its going to take the whole team were going to be fine
3660791 bluefield has always been the first game but as far as who we play first im just ready to scrap it on and go to be honest with you
3660792 if bluefield is not first that is fine with me right now our focus is christiansburg and thats what were planning on
3660793 it was always a dream through pee wee and little league and everything you always wanted to play for graham
3660794 going out to middle school and coming out to watch high school games it was always what you wanted to do
3660795 i hope so it really depends on this year and how hard i work
3660796 theres no doubt i definitely want to play but theres no definites as for where
3660797 the fincastle country club course is close to home theres always a quality field its a very well run tournament and its usually decided on the back nine on sunday
3660798 when i was young my dad would take me to the local course and id play then when i was 13 or 14 i started playing all the time
3660799 i grew up playing golf with adults and i learned a lot from them
3660800 i usually do a good job of getting the most out of a round minimizing mental errors
3660801 i cant practice as much as id like to so im not as consistent as i want to be
3660802 ill play 15 holes rather well but i want to get to a point where i can sustain a high level of play throughout each round
3660803 the greens at fincastle are getting back to the condition they were in several years ago when a bogey was almost unavoidable if your approach shot ended up above the hole
3660804 this year i believe the contenders will include a good mix of both the younger guys who hit it long and the more experienced golfers who hit it straight
3660805 i play the course with the intention of keeping the ball below the hole
3660806 when i hit a bad shot i have to be patient and look to get that shot back later in the round you cant underestimate the importance of local course knowledge either
3660807 charlie green and todd satterfield have won this tournament several times they know the course well and theyll probably be right there again garland green though is going to be hard to beat hes playing very well and this is his home course
3660808 id like to be in contention going into the final day
3660809 so often if you play a steady round on sunday you have a very good chance to win
3660810 die weitgehende aufl sung der modellreserve war angemessen weil die methodischen bewertungsrisiken aus dem cdo portfolio nunmehr berschaubar sind
3660811 wir gehen davon aus dass wir die gegebenenfalls noch erforderlichen erfolgswirksamen cdo anpassungen weitestgehend bis ende 2008 bew ltigen werden
3660812 die immer noch ungewissen marktaussichten lassen zuverl ssige prognosen kaum zu
3660813 der weitere jahresverlauf sollte diese einsch tzung grunds tzlich best tigen wenn nicht neue externe schocks allen marktteilnehmern einen strich durch die rechnung machen
3660814 were still competing for the job and theres no starter right now no job is safe at the quarterback position right now were coming into camp and getting ready for the season well see who comes out on top of it
3660815 its just a matter of knowing the stuff and getting the team in the right plays at the right time
3660816 i feel like i can do that as do the other guys its going to be fun to see what happens
3660817 all of them are equally talented its just a matter of who is going to step up and lead us
3660818 its a lot of pressure so youve got to be able to handle it
3660819 i dont know i guess youve got to go ask other people about that
3660820 i just go out there and like i said try to get the team in the right play and lead any way i can and try to put points on the board

3660826 as part of our strategy to diversify the sources of funding for the investment programme we are exploring the possibility of accessing the international debt capital markets through the issuance of foreign bonds
3660827 is the pricing level in the debt market acceptable to transnet
3660828 the sheer volume of eskoms needs will affect pricing in terms of the supply of and demand for credit
3660829 the committee is seriously concerned that the reasons provided by the department on ex facto approvals are not compliant with supply chain management regulations and may be tantamount to irregular expenditure
3660830 in the sundry payment process manual payments are made to suppliers this is done only when goods and services are procured and the value is available on receipt of an invoice however the department continues to investigate these payments
3660831 but the auditor general should recognise the investment in the future and add value on how we could improve on delivering this objective

3660840 we entertain thousands of families from the new york area each year so to have family kingdom featured so prominently in newsday is quite a thrill
3660841 we hope the exposure the area and our park received will remind long islanders of the fun they have had at family kingdom and that they will make a trip to the park a vacation tradition

3660843 there are currently 116 operating wooden coasters in the us and we have ridden all of them except 9
3660844 we have been riding wooden coasters in the us for 20 years now and we only need to ride the remaining 9 to complete the set
3660845 however with unconquered rides spread from new jersey to southern alabama and seattle this is not a regular vacation
3660846 we entertain thousands of families from the new york area each year so to have family kingdom featured so prominently in newsday is quite a thrill
3660847 we hope the exposure the area and our park received will remind long islanders of the fun they have had at family kingdom and that they will make a trip to the park a vacation tradition
3660848 deep frustration over the lack of credibility of the electoral process and their inability to elect leaders of their choice
3660849 in particular the committee will make recommendations on the focal issues of the composition autonomy and funding of the electoral commissions
3660850 we have received the respective roles and functions of inec and states independent electoral commissions and we will make appropriate recommendations

3660853 despite the global slowdown smes across all regions need to look ahead to when the global economy rebounds most still have a near term focus with only modest interest in technology areas that have been getting a lot of attention elsewhere
3660854 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3660855 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3660856 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3660857 we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration
3660858 with all of the excitement surrounding the presidential election aopa members have been asking me who should i vote for president
3660859 rather than endorsing a candidate weve asked the campaigns where they stand on ga well publish the answers in the november 2008 aopa pilot
3660860 as a part of the start b 1bs were classified as no longer nuclear capable and we were not authorized to use the exterior of the aircraft to mount pods
3660861 we had to get approval to mount the pods on the exterior of the aircraft
3660862 in todays fight we are most often employed in a close air support role from medium altitude
3660863 in that capacity a sniper equipped b 1b is an exponential increase in combat capability
3660864 the big difference with radar is only large objects like buildings are visible
3660865 we could see buildings and vehicles but not people also radar is a picture in time whereas the pod provides us with real time streaming video which enhances our capability
3660866 now the guys on the ground can see the video provided by the pod at the same time as us and thats something weve never been able to do before
3660867 the pod also gives us immediate bomb damage assessment whereas before any assessment had to come from someone on the ground
3660868 the training requirement was significant because it took place during our regular spin up time prior to the deployment
3660869 for aircrew the training involved approximately 10 to 12 hours of academics three flights for wsos and two flights for pilots when youre talking 50 crewmembers flying the same three aircraft this is a challenge
3660870 training plays a critical role in fielding a new subsystem like the sniper pod
3660871 avionics and weapons systems technicians attend a school in florida to learn how to maintain repair and up and download the pod and its supporting pylon
3660872 support equipment includes consolidated tool kits specialized adapters for bomb loaders and support dollies
3660873 additionally several supply kit items required modification in order to support this new critical capability
3660874 the sniper pod itself may have made it into theater after a two day flight from home station but hundreds of maintenance and logistics personnel spent many months behind the scenes to make it happen
3660875 the aircraft went to davis monthan air force base ariz for modification and then to ellsworth afb where the aircrew and maintenance personnel got to train with them
3660876 its all very new to us but with the few flights weve had its performed very well
3660877 sniper atp brings an amazing new capability to the already amazing b 1b
3660878 it increases the speed and accuracy with which the aircrew and the joint tactical air controllers can execute the find fix track target portion of the kill chain
3660879 our enemies now have even less opportunity to avoid us less opportunity to get away and less opportunity to continue their efforts against the populations of iraq and afghanistan
3660880 were honored to help bring sniper to another aircraft in the aor and to help realize the culmination of years of work by many people were glad to have the opportunity to employ it now in this very critical fight that our coalition is waging
3660881 logitech research revealed that the vast majority of people who use a notebook pc are mobile both within and outside the home

3660887 dear marijuana is a very dangerous drug and the legalization of it is a controversial issue our nation is looking for ways to prevent our young people smoking cigarettes while also dealing with the enormous health costs associated with long term smoking if we were to simultaneously eliminate societys attempts to restrict marijuana smoking we would be sending mixed messages to our young people and encouraging an expensive as well as destructive habit it is also very dangerous for anyone attempting to drive on our streets operate hazardous equipment or pilot public transportation such as commercial aircraft while under the influence of mind altering drugs the rights and protections to our society always need to be weighed with individual rights to engage in destructive behavior warmest regards zach wamp member of congress
3660888 oh holy shit youre right who the fuck is this woman where the hell is my wife

3660891 the new embraer 190 simulator allows all our pilots to receive the best training with the most advanced technology in the industry without having to travel to other countries
3660892 we are very proud of our leadership in latin american aviation once again we are in the vanguard of training technology
3660893 having an embraer 190 simulator in panama means greater staff productivity and flexibility for the company
3660894 the simulator is programmed for more than 7 300 hours of use per year the equivalent of an average of 20 hours of use a day a day by copa and aero republica pilots
3660895 what we can tell is there were three fatalities in the aircraft as to what happened as to what may have transpired prior to that we dont know at this point
3660896 it was very fortunate no one in the parking lot was hurt it was miraculous
3660897 when i looked up i could see the underbelly clearly i could see the tail clearly
3660898 there was no landing gear down there was no attempt for it to slow down it crashed with the nose in a nosedive and it erupted into a ball of flames there was black smoke everywhere
3660899 today we are celebrating significant progress towards the completion of cak 2018 our 10 year 110 million capital improvement plan the 5 23 runway project is the cornerstone of cak 2018 and we are committed to it to the core it is important not only to our airport authority but to our airline partners and our community as well
3660900 its a pleasure to celebrate the halfway point in the 5 23 extension project with the airport and community leaders
3660901 it has been a pleasure to watch this place grow and thrive for the more than 30 years and i know that because of projects like this our airport will be serving this community well for decades to come

3660904 its hard to grasp the historic nature of the day
3660905 todays meeting was a productive review of the draft amendment and the process that will be undertaken going forward
3660906 it is clear that the defense department met the concerns raised by the government accountability office and the draft amendment to the kc x tanker request for proposals addresses those concerns by clarifying but not altering the tanker requirements and specifications
3660907 it is also clear that the department recognizes the need to begin production on the next generation of aerial refueling tankers as quickly as possible with the current fleet approaching the half century mark in age our men and women in uniform should not be asked to wait any longer
3660908 we look forward to submitting our proposal within the timeline established by the defense department
3660909 my pledge to all today is that the air force will keep the promise to our teammates and to our families and to all our partners who rely on us every day that trust is critical is born from expertise respect for our joint partners and rigorous accountability we will work together to reinvigorate the air forces institutions and show ourselves completely worthy of americas trust
3660910 the american public support for missile defense is at the highest level ever recorded and has shown the continual increase in the publics awareness of the threat and their support for the united states to have missile defense to defend them from that threat since 2002 when the president and congress made the decision to deploy missile defenses for our country

3660916 tegar and i agree that the ship was cut into three pieces with surgical precision there is no extraneous debris
3660917 the odd part is that there are no signs of any organics either whatever happened the crew live or dead are not present
3660918 yep the section containing the engine room and shuttle bays has full power and yes all the ships lifeboats and shuttles are all still in their docks however the crew left it wasnt by anything onboard

3660938 consumers may find if situations get tougher they wont have any savings to help them through harder times
3660939 many consumers may not realise what a negative effect this is having on their savings

3660947 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3660948 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows

3660953 do unto to other as you others done onto you
3660954 he knew that i was pregnant but he was told that you had died in childbirth it was the only way to protect you both of you i dont know if he ever figured it out or if achtar told him i had to be rushed away from the city right after you were born or they would have killed me i never saw aldranar again before he died
3660955 my dear i must say ive never been so aroused in my entire life
3660956 my lady unless you wish me to take you here and now and have my way with you i suggest that you remove your person from mine and remove this knife from my throat im finding it rather difficult to think with you so tantalizingly close to me
3660957 forgive me for not jumping to answer your call my lady but i am not used to being awoken by an assassin in my bed with a knife to my throat
3660958 every time what every time that i find out that my father was the one being in this entire world who showed me any compassion that he was a man that i knew even though i was not aware of it at the time and that he was killed before i could ever truly get to know him because i dont foresee this happening a lot in the future
3660959 for most of the time that he knew you he did not know that he was your father although once he witnessed you hide from dark vision i believe he began to suspect he was quite intelligent of course and virtually no one in drow society is capable of pulling on magic from a source that is not external but the only indication that he truly knew who you were came right at the very end when he gave you that dagger he must have known it was you for i never told him to do that and that dagger was meant for one person alone in this world and that is the daughter of aldranar and ilyndriana
3660960 dont be daft lady it was dangerous enough that he knew who you were it would have been suicide to tell you of your heritage you know that
3660961 he must have known that night not just because of the dagger but he warned me he had never raised his hand to me before outside of our training but that night i started to cry once i knew he might be killed and he he slapped me slapped me and told me i could not mourn him he told me it would be dangerous he knew and he tried to protect me
3660962 i am sorry lady i am sorry for what you had to endure i wish there had been another way
3660963 it is fine i was just thinking about what happened

3660975 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3660976 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3660977 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3661043 pak hakim yang mulia beberapa hari yang lalu amirul mukminin membeli seekor kuda dari saya
3661044 tapi kemarin tiba tiba ia ingin mengembalikannya lagi dan meminta ganti
3661045 aku ingin mengembalikan kuda itu padanya karena kudanya cacat dan berpenyakit sehingga larinya tidak kencang
3661046 saya tidak akan menerimanya lagi karena saya sudah menjual kuda itu dalam keadaan sehat dan tidak cacat
3661047 apakah ketika amirul mukminin membeli kuda itu keadaannya sehat dan tidak cacat
3661048 nah kalau begitu peliharalah apa yang anda beli atau bila ingin mengembalikannya kembalikanlah seperti ketika anda menerimanya
3661049 pak hakim aku mendapatkan baju perangku ditangan orang ini padahal aku tidak pernah memberikan atau menjualnya pada siapapun
3661050 aku yakin sekali karena satu satunya orang yang memiliki baju perang seperti itu hanya aku baju perang itu terjatuh di suatu tempat dan kini baju perang itu ada padanya bagaimana mungkin aku menjualnya di pasar
3661051 aku tidak meragukan apa yang anda katakan itu tapi anda wajib mengajukan dua orang saksi untuk dijadikan saksi atas apa yang anda akui itu
3661052 pembantuku qanbar akan kujadikan saksi dan satu lagi al hasan anakku
3661053 subhanallah kesaksian al hasan salah seorang pemuda penghuni surga tidak diterima
3661054 aku tidak punya saksi lain jadi baju perang ini memang milikmu
3661055 memang betul baju perang ini milikmu hari ini aku melihat seorang hakim yang begitu teguh menegakkan ajaran allah ia memenangkan aku sungguh aku lihat islam melakukan kebenaran saat ini juga aku akan menjadi penganut islam
3661056 pak hakim yang mulia sebenarnya aku telah memungut baju perang amirul mukminin sewaktu terjatuh pada peperangan di siffin
3661057 karena kau sudah masuk islam maka kuhadiahkan baju perang itu kepadamu dan juga kuda ini
3661058 ah masih sedikit saja hasil kebunmu kawan kasihan sekali kau lihat hartaku jauh lebih banyak dari hartamu dan pengikutku juga banyak
3661059 ah kebunku yang indah aku dapat merasakan bahwa kebun ini tidak akan binasa untuk selama lamanya bahkan hari kiamat pun kuyakin tak akan tiba
3661060 melihat kekayaan dan kedudukanku di tengah masyarakat aku yakin seandainya ada kebangkitan dan kehidupan kembali dan aku dikembalikan kepada tuhanku maka tentu aku akan berada disisinya dengan kemuliaan dan keutamaan di sana tuhanku akan memberi ganjaran yang lebih baik pula dari kebun ini karena tuhanku telah memuliakanku dengan kebun ini tentulah tuhanku akan memberi kemuliaan pula kelak
3661061 apakah kamu akan kafir pada tuhan yang telah menciptakan kamu dari tanah lalu dari setetes air mani lalu dia menjadikan kamu seorang laki laki yang sempurna adapun aku aku percaya bahwa dialah allah tuhanku dan aku tidak mempersekutukan seorangpun dengan tuhanku
3661062 kalau kamu menganggap aku lebih sedikit darimu dalam hal memiliki harta dan keturunan maka mudah mudahan tuhanku akan memberi kepadaku kebun yang lebih dari pada kebunmu
3661063 lalu ditinggalkannya temannya yang sombong dan zalim itu untuk dapat merenungi ucapannya
3661064 ha dimana kebunku dimana kebunku yang indah dan subur itu

3661071 kita campur saja susu itu dengan air supaya penghasilan kita cepat bertambah
3661072 khalifah melarang keras semua penjual susu mencampur susu dengan air
3661073 ah kenapa kau dengarkan khalifah itu setiap hari kita selalu miskin dan tidak akan berubah kalau tidak melakukan sesuatu
3661074 ibu hanya karena kita ingin mendapat keuntungan yang besar lalu kita berlaku curang pada pembeli
3661075 tapi tidak akan ada yang tahu kita mencampur susu dengan air tengah malam begini tak ada yang berani keluar khalifah umar pun tidak akan tahu perbuatan kita
3661076 ayolah nak mumpung tengah malam tak ada yang melihat kita
3661077 bu meskipun tidak ada seorang pun yang melihat dan mengetahui kita mencampur susu dengan air tapi allah tetap melihat allah pasti mengetahui segala perbuatan kita serapi apa pun kita menyembunyikannya
3661078 aku tidak mau melakukan ketidak jujuran pada waktu ramai maupun sunyi aku yakin allah tetap selalu mengawasi apa yang kita lakukan setiap saat
3661079 tuan saya dan anak saya tidak pernah melakukan kecurangan dalam menjual susu tuan jangan tangkap kami
3661080 bagaimana mungkin tuan adalah seorang putra khalifah tidak selayaknya menikahi gadis miskin seperti anakku
3661081 khalifah adalah orang yang tidak membedakan manusia sebab hanya ketawakalanlah yang meninggikan derajad seseorang disisi allah

3661129 during the hottest days of the cold war gen thomas power headed the strategic air command whose nuclear armed b 52s were meant to deter the soviet union general power like many of the air force brass at the time believed that nuclear war with the soviets was inevitable he thought the united states would do better to fight that war sooner rather than later and believed we could emerge victorious at the end of the war he argued in 1960 if there are two americans and one russian we win listening to john mccain talk about iraq and iran i keep thinking of power counter insurgency and nuclear obliteration are poles apart i know but mccains insistence on winning in iraq remaining there until iraq is secure and bomb bomb bombing iran reveal the same mindset that made general power so dangerous

3661148 dying and rising messiah appears in some jewish texts but until now everyone thought that was the impact of christianity on judaism
3661149 but for the first time we have proof that it was the other way around the concept was there before jesus
3661150 this should shake our basic view of christianity what happens in the new testament could have been adopted by jesus and his followers based on an earlier messiah story
3661151 it is certainly not perfectly clear that the tablet is talking about a crucified and risen savior figure called simon

3661200 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3661201 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3661202 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3661203 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3661204 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3661205 there is merit in looking at how we make sure there is a proper international presence there
3661206 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people

3661210 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3661211 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3661212 on the podium i kept tearing up im almost at a loss for words its the most fun part of being part of a team its the best thing having four americans swim all well together
3661213 id better hope theres some left in the tank from now on its just a downward slope the end is close and i love it not a bad day
3661214 it was a demonstration of russias new strength for all those who believed that russia could be ignored
3661215 russia has certainly gotten up off its knees and sat in a tank
3661216 otherwise it would have shown that moscow is completely impotent
3661217 what gave washington legitimacy nothing more than strength and now it is russia who has become strong

3661219 we asked what any deal would cost and then we tried to be creative with it youve got to be creative once the figures are out of your reach
3661220 if youve got a receptive selling club then youve got a chance but the ins and outs of the deal make it a very expensive one
3661221 we have always been looking at hyland but there are complications with the work permit situation
3661222 at the moment he fails to satisfy the criteria he has played in friendly matches but they have to be competitive so they do not count
3661223 its a shame because he is very much one for the future and a player we are interested in
3661224 we are not even sure when we will find out the outcome its a case of how long is a piece of string
3661225 eso es lo bueno de estas competencias si nos ganan tendremos la revancha el equipo que pierde nunca perdona
3661226 sabemos que es la primera ronda pero hemos perdido s lo un partido en dos a os y grecia es el nico equipo que nos ha ganado as que definitivamente sentimos que hay una cuenta pendiente

3661265 die finanzmarktkrise f hrte zwar zu belastungen aus der bewertung von wertpapieren doch dank unserer konservativen anlagestrategie blieben die auswirkungen berschaubar
3661266 wir freuen uns ber das starke erste halbjahr 2008 neben der integration der akquirierten unternehmen und der damit verbundenen kapazit tsausweitung haben wir mit der k rzlich durchgef hrten kapitalerh hung die basis f r ein anhaltend dynamisches wachstum geschaffen wir konnten zudem neue richtungweisende kooperationen schlie en und werden die wertsch pfungstiefe unserer produktionslinien weiter ausbauen dies festigt unsere marktposition so dass wir auch k nftig von den wachstumschancen im in und ausland profitieren

3661268 was wir erleben ist der populistische versuch bedr ngter landespolitiker in bayern und leider auch anderswo die gesundheit ihrer b rger aufs spiel zu setzen um einer als m chtig empfundenen lobby zu diensten zu sein
3661269 weil die leute sp ren dass hier die relationen nicht stimmen hauptbetroffen sind hunderttausende b rgerinnen und b rger die in mit feinstaub hoch belasteten stadtquartieren leben und arbeiten und nicht spediteure die einer hohen finanziellen zusatzbelastung durch einen schlichten werkstattbesuch weitgehend entkommen k nnen
3661270 dieser nachweis umweltpolitischer ignoranz wird auch im ausland wahrgenommen werden
3661271 bei der hochrechnung angeblicher mautbelastungen mit faulen tricks und faschen zahlen

3661295 zeng jinyan a beijing based human rights activist disappeared on august 7 all attempts to contact her have failed it is feared that zeng has been taken into police custody and might be mistreated
3661296 the beijing police are either so incompetent that they would let her disappear under their nose or that they must be responsible for taking her away how can a young woman with an infant child sabotage the olympics while under such heavy and round the clock police presence
3661297 das umsatzminus im warenhausgesch ft ist eine ziemlich gro e entt uschung zumal die wirtschaftswoche am montag berichtet hatte dass die kaufhausgruppe karstadt ein umsatzplus von 1 5 prozent berichten werde

3661299 die zahlen im warenhausgesch ft lagen deutlich unter den erwartungen der turnaround bleibt weiter aus und nun kommt hinzu dass das konjunkturelle umfeld zunehmend schwieriger wird

3661335 we always had security arrangements in place even before they could fully start the demonstration we had them under control
3661336 petitioners have the right to apply we dont dare to touch them
3661337 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3661338 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3661339 its the first time id been a part of a win in a long time
3661340 i didnt think id be as nervous as i was

3661342 he gave up the two but after that he was pretty stingy
3661343 weve got a lot to learn from the result but that will make us stronger and a better government
3661344 its a message that im determined to listen to determined to unravel and understand the elements of that message and respond to territorians concerns right across this great northern territory of ours
3661345 but it is clear we are in a position to form a government and we will be doing that over the next couple of days before the declaration of the poll on monday
3661346 im very proud and humble today to achieve a win
3661347 four men were standing on a pontoon at a sandstone quarry when for some unknown reason the pontoon has flipped
3661348 a lady walking on the beach alerted us to this it appears to be human remains we havent absolutely confirmed it it will be confirmed through a pathologist
3661349 aw gosh this is the same spit where the plane took off from its a constant reminder of the lack of closure
3661350 he may be human but hes from a different planet
3661351 no hes from this planet of course but hes just tremendously talented
3661352 now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it i have absolutely nothing to say im speechless
3661353 it started sinking in a little bit after the butterfly i was trying to focus on my next race i was just thinking wow the greatest olympian of all time
3661354 its a pretty cool thing its a pretty cool title i guess you could say its pretty neat and im definitely honoured
3661355 its not over yet anything can happen in the next three events im not unbeatable no ones unbeatable everyone can be beat
3661356 i was just disappointed that i know i can go faster than that
3661357 birthday happens every year christmas happens every year you only get to be olympic gold medallist so many times
3661358 this is almost everything ive asked for i would like to have been faster in the 200 fly but in the circumstances i think i handled myself pretty well

3661364 he was always ready to help people out people in the family and others as well
3661365 we lost our little luc but i think that shippagan as well has lost someone important
3661366 the truck driver tried everything is his power to avoid the accident
3661367 he came to the arena and he used to talk to all the little guys there and he used to play hockey with them
3661368 everybody keeps telling me how great it is to finish 4th in an olympic race at nearly 50 its probably true but bronze was so close
3661369 when i race i dont feel like im 50 i dont race with a calendar i had never felt as much power in me
3661370 i dont like the word work but i really worked hard for that and i was probably in my best shape before any olympics
3661371 with better race conditions on sunday and a little bit of luck im sure i could have been on a podium
3661372 without the rain on sunday i would not have had this pain and without this pain who knows
3661373 to top it all i missed a gear in the last turn before the finish which might have cost me the two seconds i needed
3661374 i moved back to the village this year because it was perfect i just had to walk down the stairs to get massaged and i had a little oven to cook my meals

3661386 our mines are operating as planned our expansion projects are progressing well and we continued to realize on excellent silver prices there is no question that of late silver prices have been extremely volatile however the fundamentals remain positive and i am optimistic that silver will trend higher over the balance of the year leading to continuing strong financial results for pan american
3661387 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood i wouldnt change my past because its groomed me to be the man i am today people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry therere a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the business man
3661388 got scared and he ran over here he was bleeding
3661389 i kept telling him you dont want to do this
3661390 for how long can i get away from reality with it before tedium sets in
3661391 as far as i know this is the first indie game theyve mentioned directly in a comic which is pretty cool
3661392 i admit it comes down to people opinions of the type of games they like but you cant argue that there is a hell of a lot of game right there for 800 pts
3661393 15 bucks for a game that will maybe last you 5 hours its simply not enough
3661394 heres the facts theres not enough game play for 15 dollars
3661395 at least add extra modes or something that we can come back to
3661396 they didnt make that movie good enough to justify the 3 hours
3661397 my issue isnt with the price its with the game itself seems too short but to be fair i dont know how long the other four worlds are the first world world 2 is painfully short though
3661398 unique enough for you to have to dish out extra dough
3661399 be greatful the fact that the game was completed and is here for you to play
3661400 i wouldnt complain about the price of the mona lisa just because there isnt much to look at
3661401 the simple fact that this controversy exists at all proves that a poor judgment was made on how much they could get away with
3661402 braid seems to me to not be at all about replayability and some people seem to put that very strongly in their equation of how much a game should cost
3661403 for how long can i get away from reality with it before tedium sets in
3661404 still havent been convinced by anything anybody has said i played through the trial again just trying to get some sort of buzz that some people are feeling but its not there
3661405 its unfortunate that some people do feel the need to try and guilt others into buying a game though
3661406 others are bickering too much about it though and taking it personal which tells me they arent confident in their decision
3661407 flamebait no those are not technically speaking games theres a reason we call that kind of software sandbox games
3661408 rules and victory conditions are not exactly contested as qualifiers for
3661409 also given all the times ive had massive chunks of ice thrown at me in a snowball fight or been attacked by my erstwhile teammates i wouldnt say snowball fights have any unspoken rules
3661410 youll have to come up with an actual game to use as an example on your own good luck with that because i dont think youll be able to
3661411 flamebait no those are not technically speaking games theres a reason we call that kind of software sandbox games
3661412 rules and victory conditions are not exactly contested as qualifiers for
3661413 also given all the times ive had massive chunks of ice thrown at me in a snowball fight or been attacked by my erstwhile teammates i wouldnt say snowball fights have any unspoken rules
3661414 youll have to come up with an actual game to use as an example on your own good luck with that because i dont think youll be able to
3661415 there is 5 worth of game play in that 10 game
3661416 a dinner can cost 20 and wont last more than 10 minutes it also wont entertain you
3661417 quantifying the value of anything based on the amount of time that it entertain you is a narrow view of what makes something worth what it is
3661418 any game longer than get gets repetitive unless its moddable
3661419 if youre saying braid isnt worth 15 then youre comparing it to commercial games a dinner can cost 20 and wont last more than 10 minutes
3661420 a 20 dinner will last 10 minutes but the same 10 minutes at wolfgang pucks restaurant will cost you 200 quantifying the value of anything based on the amount of time that it entertain you is a narrow view of what makes something worth what it is

3661430 an investor doesnt really need to know our tv results in order to know whether to buy and sell our shares
3661431 but our competitor in tv sure as hell wants to know and thats why we havent disclosed
3661432 when youre at the formative stages of launching a major service that you are doing for long term strategic reasons you can do without the scrutiny of did you go up or down or jeez you really knocked their socks off this quarter which creates the emotion for the other guy to drop price and retaliate

3661438 the longer a prospect lingers around whatever it is that you sell provide service or promote the more of their imagination they add and the closer they shift into selling or closing themselves the key is to give people a reason to sit within your sales funnel for as long as possible

3661457 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3661458 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3661459 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
3661460 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3661461 as far as we are concerned we let off the fireworks thats whats important to us
3661462 i may let him tell you i dont know he said he did it in the scrimmage saturday but he was ok til he woke up sunday morning

3661464 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont want to dh
3661465 i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it
3661466 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3661467 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3661468 i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench
3661469 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
3661470 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3661471 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3661472 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3661473 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work he couldnt throw in from the outfield

3661476 capcom is extremely excited to work with grin to bring the world class franchise of bionic commando into the 21st century
3661477 capcom has also always been strong partners with nvidia and with bionic commando we are taking things to a new level by adding gpu accelerated physx to increase the titles realism
3661478 physics is changing the industry we evaluated all of the commercial physics systems out there for gaming and the choice was easy
3661479 nvidia physx runs faster than other solutions and it works across pcs and consoles which is important to us because bionic commando will ship on all major platforms we believe physx will help make the game seem even more lifelike and immersive
3661480 the gaming industry and gamers themselves are excited to see the return of bionic commando the addition of physics effects using physx technology is going to add a huge amount of extra fun and depth to the game play
3661481 we cant wait to see what the talented team at capcom and grin can create using the nvidia physx technology and hands on support from our developer technology team
3661482 how did final fantasy xiii end up on the xbox 360
3661483 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console square has done games for us in the past and i think theres a point where square just has to look at the xbox 360 the install base and attach rates that were seeing and actually has to make a decision on their own that its the right thing to do for them i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360
3661484 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
3661485 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

3661489 one of the most novel approaches to audio for years
3661490 i dont think youve seen the same pace of innovation from microsoft as you have from sony recently
3661491 its been steadily improving the playstation 3 as an online gaming device and an entertainment device while the xbox 360 has had its half yearly updates but theres nothing groundbreaking thats been released other than a couple of changes to the marketplace
3661492 we have a really good relationship with sony and its great to see the evolution of the platform i think its experienced a lot of evolution and in some places playstation 3 is definitely beating out xbox
3661493 were working very closely with nintendo but the vision is all about how to make the online multiplayer environment less scary to its audience
3661494 nintendo is very sensitive about that and its refreshing it applies a critical lens to the issue
3661495 for example with mario kart wii theres not a high score list instead your ranking is shown on a much more friendly distribution curve so youre not a number youre not 451 479th best player in the world youre somewhere in the middle of the bell shaped curve maybe a bit better than average which is important because most players arent going to number 1 in the world and dont care about that but they might care about being the second highest rated player amongst their friends or the best player in their zip code

3661501 these big trucks and suvs are really dinosaurs at this point
3661502 consumers like suvs they havent fallen out of love with the things that made them popular but its just become an issue of economics when you look at paying several hundred dollars a month more in fuel that becomes a big deal for most households

3661504 director clark gregg knew that id written choke while listening to pablo honey with creep over and over and over

3661506 theyve written the score most of the ambient music throughout it so its choke with the music of radiohead
3661507 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3661508 what the rest of world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilised values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3661509 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii

3661538 weve probably got our tougher matches to come and we need to work hard in them as well
3661539 any result 10 0 is pretty big it is good its always good to get a big win
3661540 its tough for us but we feel that were very fit at the moment and i think thats taken the toll on the other team
3661541 the more we can push harder i think its making the other team struggle a lot more
3661542 we worked very hard in perth at the heat chamber at the ais there
3661543 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3661544 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3661545 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3661546 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3661547 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3661548 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3661549 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3661550 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3661551 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3661552 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks

3661561 in fiecare luna apar agentii noi sunt oamenii care au lucrat in multinationale si isi fac firme cu doi trei cinci oameni si preiau proiecte

3661563 poate fi frumos si in constructii si in comunicarea business to business cand sunt clienti mai mici acestia sunt mai flexibili in corporatii se lucreaza altfel de exemplu daca este coordonare regionala trebuie sa primesti acordul si din afara

3661604 the situation in the national volleyball team is very good
3661605 what has happened resulted mainly from the tests the national anti doping laboratory had made in pravets i understand that there is a protocol to show that all the players results are negative if there were players with positive results the tests would have been sent to the world anti doping laboratory
3661606 in korea where the team went on preparation camp we received a call from doctor karova who studied the tests results in pravets and she told me that plamens results were alarming
3661607 there were two alternatives for plamen firstly hed have to find a way to take the test and if the results came back positive hed be able to stay in the olympic village but would be unable to play if the results came back clear hed be able to continue playing in the team

3661615 paradoxically what is perceived as our weakness is in truth a real strength we allow ourselves to be vulnerable and that reminds us that we are a moral and ethical people
3661616 hostage negotiations turn national issues into personal ones we all feel like we are negotiating for someone in our unit in our family
3661617 kidnap the enemy in turn or make it harder for the enemy to kidnap our soldiers like the idf brass should have done in the beginning but do whatever it takes to get our boys back
3661618 paradoxically what is perceived as our weakness is in truth a real strength we allow ourselves to be vulnerable and that reminds us that we are a moral and ethical people
3661619 my friend argued passionately tonight that hezbollah terrorists and their iranian masters will kidnap no matter what because their hatred is irrational but even the venal the monstrous even the lowest animal for that matter understands cause and effect

3661698 i consciously look for ways to break the rules when composing and arranging which i hope keeps the music fresh and innovative
3661699 nu jazz is to traditional jazz what punk or grunge was to rock nu jazz instrumentation ranges from the traditional to the experimental the melodies are fresh and the rhythms new and alive it makes jazz fun again

3661759 emperors hated him his enemies falsely accused him of cruelty sorcery and even murder he was exiled five times and in the face of it all he became the single most articulate voice defending the true and undiluted catholic faith which is why even today we remember him as athanasius

3661779 it determines the layout shape and structure of the land and the incoming council should be in the drivers seat
3661780 there is no urgency in dealing with this matter and it would be much more appropriate to defer it
3661781 this is certainly an important document and it will guide development for x number of years
3661782 all were doing is forwarding a draft to the department of planning were not signing off on it
3661783 by your decision tonight it will be one step forward and then several back if the lep has to be resubmitted to the department of planning

3661792 its definitely got dramatic and serious content id say theres strong adult themes and sexual references but its also got a playfulness and lightness its a lot of fun
3661793 it packs a punch emotionally theres fight scenes sex scenes lots of cracking scenes that are beautifully written and leave you hanging on the edge of your seat
3661794 its risky making a play that reflects where i live when ive only been here 18 months but its work that excites me work i can imagine being thrilled by if i was in the audience
3661795 not attending one or more of the extraordinary meetings held on 15 22 and 29 july
3661796 still had a conflict of interest when he attended the 29 july extraordinary meeting
3661797 i find it somewhat farcical that were even talking about a code of conduct given the events that occurred last month
3661798 we need to show the public that when issues arise and there are suspicions about the code of conduct that we will investigate
3661799 in 17 years on council ive never seen a group so anxious to call extraordinary meetings to debate an issue that should have been considered at the next ordinary meeting and there are a number of incorrect statements in this motion
3661800 we could have ended this term in reasonable equanimity but no
3661801 this is divisive and a nonsense and cr henry should not have raised it

3661842 there is a subculture within the white southern population of which the scv is the most visible voice that feels besieged by modern culture in general and they identify the old south and confederacy as a way of life and a period of time before the siege began to really hit the south
3661843 we have indian hispanic black and white members of our camps and if anyone espouses anything hateful or racewise youre gone from the scv
3661844 i consider myself a southern gentleman but i just feel bringing this up now it represents a painful and a hurtful time and i dont think its necessary to hurt people to make a point
3661845 i think this is very likely to come back to bite them in the behind
3661846 i dont think seeing some gigantic confederate flag convinces anyone that the civil war was not about slavery and that the antebellum south was really a wonderful place where everybody got along
3661847 a flag may be a simple piece of cloth but its much more powerful than that
3661848 and if you start turning people away youre talking about a substantial investment in the local economy thats going to disappear

3661892 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3661893 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3661894 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3661895 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3661896 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3661897 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3661898 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3661899 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3661900 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3661901 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3661909 if we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphyics for instance let us ask does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number no does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence no commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion

3661944 our nation is in need of leadership the country as a whole can believe in
3661945 man of significant and promising judgment i think we need that at this time
3661946 sen mccain enjoys a great deal of support from both democrats and independents alike
3661947 as we continue to move forward with our message country first we expect to capture a great deal of democrats who will in the end help carry the state of alaska for sen mccain
3661948 if we are as a nation concerned with energy then our consideration should be a national energy policy that is not predicated on crude oil 50 years into the future
3661949 we need to get to it and i think barack obama is very clear in that regard
3661950 fairbanks residents are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country
3661951 mayor whitaker knows firsthand the importance of solving our energy crisis
3661952 mccain made the adamant statement that i know how to win wars
3661953 that is a damned poor approach to public policy and its a damned poor approach to national policy i would like a president who has the wisdom to avoid wars
3661954 its difficult for me to put significant importance on an endorsement from the mayor of the fairbanks north star borough
3661955 having said that there are many many people in the republican party and in the independent category who i think need to understand its perfectly appropriate to judge candidates based on merit rather than party affiliation
3661956 im an american first an alaskan second and a republican third
3661957 i think its in the countrys best interest and the states best interest that barack obama become president there are those who will criticize it thats part of being in politics
3661958 tix honestly sincerely and truly believed he was acting to protect himself
3661959 its hard to say the best case scenario hopefully they are on a lake somewhere waiting for us to find them
3661960 it still hasnt cleared fog banks have made it tremendously difficult for our helicopters to get off our ground at times
3661961 the fog has come down and its just sitting over the mountains its very difficult to see and its very unsafe at times for our aircraft
3661962 were trying to find out the mystery of where this aircraft and these two people have gone
3661963 the bizarre thing is the guy who shot winston he came to the hospital to see him
3661964 they wont let winston leave the country without his passport and theyve either lost it or they wont give it back
3661965 we wanted to make it even more clear than we have in the past that theres a dangerous situation along this trail corridor right now
3661966 weve been posting the area for some time now warning people about bears in the area but apparently theres still consistent use on that trail over the last couple of weeks
3661967 a lot of times well try to clear the area just to make sure we have a safe backdrop
3661968 other chains including whole foods market bjs wholesale club and rei the purveyor of outdoor goods are planning projects of their own
3661969 we thought wouldnt it be great if there was a cheers for teens where everyone knows their name
3661970 we knew there were kids in the mall but it really surprised me
3661971 some are avoiding home situations or some have totally normal homes and are just rebelling looking for acceptance in drugs or a boyfriend or girlfriend
3661972 its just kind of a fun place to get away
3661973 everyone needs to get away from their family every now and then
3661974 i probably would not be as happy as i am now its a lot more stress free than being at home or school
3661975 if they want to enter a faith based conversation they can but if they dont its okay too
3661976 the bottom line is that we want to show the love of jesus christ more than we want to talk about it
3661977 people here dont just pretend like they care they do care
3661978 i dont always take the advice but i always listen to it were teenagers
3661979 theyre at that age where society is telling them choose this way choose this way its helping them wade through that crud
3661980 a conversation can happen while playing a video game or while ordering a soda
3661981 i think its been a good place a place for the kids to go without getting in trouble
3661982 sometimes its very hard to watch people that you care about that make decisions thats making it really hard for them to succeed

3661984 saya menegaskan salah satu tugas utama pengurus dpc piki nisel adalah mejadi bagian dari rencana besar untuk menjadikan wilayah ini sebagai zona damai peace zone yang akan menjadikan pulau nias sebagai pulau damai peace island
3661985 dpc piki nisel akan menjadi barisan terdepan dalam menciptakan dan memelihara kerukunan hidup umat beragama di kabupaten nias selatan dan dalam mewujudkan rasa toleransi dengan umat beragama lainnya dengan tetap melindungi dan menghargai kelompok agama minoritas berdasarkan kasih kristus
3661986 saat ini nisel merupakan salah satu daerah yang kental dengan kkn kami berharap sebagai daerah yang mayoritas kristen menjadi daerah yang bebas dari kkn apalagi para pengurus piki nisel ini sebagiannya sebagai aparatur pemerintah dengan itu diharapkan berkontribusi menghilangkan kkn di nisel
3661987 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3661988 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3661989 kita sangat prihatin dengan kejadian itu sangat memiriskan hati melihat dari apa yang terjadi mahasiswa dilempari disiram air keras dan masih banyak lagi kelihatan sekali kejadian itu terencana
3661990 saya juga sudah meminta dia mencabut pernyataan itu itu juga salah satu contoh sikap pejabat negara yang tidak boleh dicontoh karena hanya akan memecah belah
3661991 itu tidak boleh terjadi itu jangan dicontoh termasuk di nisel wilayah ini harus jadi zona damai dan pulau damai
3661992 semoga ini juga menjadi menjadi perhatian pemerintah daerah lihatlah anak anak kita disana kondisi mereka sangat memprihatinkan gubernur kalbar sudah melakukan itu dengan mengunjungi mahasiswa mahasiswi yang merupakan putra putri daerahnya

3661994 our deepest sympathies go out to the chinese people and those affected by this terrible event
3661995 esri china beijing along with esri teams in redlands california and many gis organizations and individuals are working diligently to support the rescue efforts headed by the cea and other agencies in the disaster area their work is important and has made a difference in the immediate rescue and relief efforts its going to continue to help in long term recovery with gis professionals working to rebuild communities and help people
3661996 gis gives you a very good visualization method to understand what is happening in real time
3661997 gis also provides tools to better analyze large volumes of complex data immediately following the earthquake we worked on a continuous basis with government agencies and others to offer assistance wherever we could we will continue to support the long term recovery the work being done with gis is helping to reduce the impact of this large complex disaster
3661998 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up
3661999 the best defensive strategy is always preparedness weve spent eight years completely ignoring that while the chinese and indian governments have been paying really close attention and investing many tens of billions of dollars

3662225 there is no registration fee just go ahead vote and create an osc

3662284 i enjoyed working with writer turned director sanjay chhel and mallika
3662285 for me art film has a non formula story the distinction lies in whether you can predict the story or not

3662287 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions

3662301 im going far away i want you to treat wenjun as your own daughter and help her do her very best
3662302 i told her the olympics is the best chance she has of finding her father

3662309 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3662310 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3662311 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3662312 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3662313 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3662314 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly

3662361 when the story of michael vicks dog fighting business came out the general public was given a glimpse of the sadistic world of dog fighting
3662362 they were horrified to learn that dog fighters not only force these animals to fight to the death many also engage in violence against the dogs by means of electrocution strangulation kicking and other unimaginable acts of cruelty the public had known there were evil people out there who trained dogs to fight but it took a big media event to take the barbaric practice of dog fighting to the forefront of their consciousness
3662363 in a sense the vick case was a blessing in the fact that its brought this issue to light that this is happening in our society
3662364 people are learning about the cruelty many pit bulls are forced to endure and more people are turning in suspected dog fighting operations we cant let this issue fall out of the public eye and thats why we are thrilled to partner with andrei the pit bull arlovski

3662404 admittedly concierge medicine is making some significant inroads into the healthcare community but there are important questions that need to be addressed concerning this innovative practice model
3662405 the range of fees goes down to as low as 39 per month for full care concierge services
3662406 the national average is less than 150 per month and membership levels as low as 50 patients the average practice has about 600 patients as its cap keep in mind the most expensive concierge doctor with the fewest patients is the white house doctor
3662407 such critics are short sighted insurance is the problem not the solution
3662408 most primary care doctors today run from room to room with seven minute visits accomplishing next to nothing in the pursuit of generating enough cpt codes to keep the office solvent half the money paid to health plans and government for health care is wasted
3662409 concierge doctors have been shown to cut high tech and hospital costs by as much as 60 85 insurance is not a useful tool in the delivery of primary care such care should be purchased directly thus eliminating the costly meddlesome middle man
3662410 keep in mind the average concierge fee today is less than 150 per month most americans pay more for cable cell phone bills and cigarettes concierge medicine costs like cell phones are going down and such care is being used by more and more average americans that trend will continue most innovations start with wealthier people and then become generalized
3662411 our special report on concierge medicine raises concerns for all segments of the healthcare community though an interesting concept it remains to be seen how widespread concierge medicine will be adopted by patients and practitioners who generally agree that improving customer service is a priority in our consumer driven society

3662439 uncertainty is hitting closer to home with millions of people feeling that theyre living on the economic edge its not just peoples bank accounts that are being depleted their mental emotional and physical resources are being exhausted too whether its the lack of certainty about our home our health our financial stability or our personal safety it starts to eat away at our basic sense of security and well being
3662440 we need to be on the lookout for overcare an emotional habit that people commonly resort to when things are feeling unstable people can think that if theyre not worrying or obsessing over a person situation or outcome it must mean theyre not caring enough the need to worry or obsess is really just a mental and emotional habit it is possible to find an inner peace and security during stressful circumstances the stronger our foundation of inner security the more resilient we are the quicker we can recover from overcare and feelings of worry stress and anxiety and the less well drain our precious inner resources
3662441 overcare is often disguised as angst worry concern sympathy or even sentiment and can lead to stress related health issues such as headaches backaches high blood pressure digestive issues and hormonal imbalances although both men and women can experience overcare and related physical complaints our society tends to train and expect women to be caregivers so they tend to be more prone to overcaring about people or situations

3662445 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3662446 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3662447 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3662448 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3662449 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3662450 there is merit in looking at how we make sure there is a proper international presence there
3662451 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people

3662458 the customer pays rs 3 990 and gets free one year subscription with free movies sporting spectacles like indian premiere league and euro football tournament triggered dth sales people want good quality viewing this is where dth scores over cable tv
3662459 you see the very objective of buying a flat tv gets lost if the picture quality is not good another reason for our growth is our wide distribution network and dealer base it has grown manifold in one year
3662460 in the last 23 months we have given nearly 2 3 million connections making us the fastest growing dth service across the globe we score over cable tv with our dvd quality audio video for over 150 channels then our customer service is a solid a customer is attended to even at 2 am in the night our interactive application is a usp it includes education applications for children to learn english maths and general knowledge then there are cooking recipes on demand and matrimonial advisements

3662591 a consortium of researchers is monitoring the long term effects of the fire which burned 3 100 acres at lake tahoe the report says the firs impact will not be known for several years
3662592 last years inaugural state of the lake report bore the disturbing news that the climate in the lake tahoe basin is warming up nights and lake waters are warmer cold days are fewer and less precipitation falls as snow
3662593 while lake temperature declined slightly in 2007 the long term signs of global warming remain

3662596 the coach called me and was very unhappy he was asking me if all the fight we were fighting to release chinedu was just to put the boy on the bench
3662597 he said the season has started and if the coach doesnt want to play him they should release him to come back because they need him more at the club
3662598 i respect chiefs having been unbeaten in the league but we are not going to face them with our tails between our legs it is a mammoth task but we are going to fight

3662600 we wanted to avoid chiefs because this enhance chances of the trophy going to mochudi chiefs are like our brothers and it would have not been okay to play them

3662667 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3662668 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3662669 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3662670 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3662671 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3662672 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3662673 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments

3662702 spawned unpleasant and questionable behavior and comments from various persons
3662703 although i am confident the original board decision would have withstood all legal challenges by the lafayette county bar association i am equally confident the end results of the challenge would have driven a wedge in our community and caused irreparable harm to the sovereignty of the board of supervisors as well as the lafayette county bar association and its members
3662704 as it is my desire to squelch and suspend the negativity surrounding this matter i will not oppose the relocation of the lafayette county circuit court of the circuit clerk to the newly renovated courthouse notwithstanding there were sensible and prudent reasons economic and otherwise to keep the circuit court at the chancery building
3662705 we are delighted that lloyd oliphant has listened to his constituents and decided to support the relocation of the lafayette county circuit court and clerk to the newly renovated courthouse
3662706 this ensures the investment lafayette county and the city of oxford has made will not be lost allowing the circuit court to move back into the courthouse will ensure the safety and security of the citizens of lafayette county and those who routinely utilize the courts will be protected we look forward to the board of supervisors taking official action on this matter at the earliest possible date
3662707 im just happy he realized the circumstances and came to the conclusion that he did
3662708 it shows hes got character and i applaud that he listened to his constituents and made the right choice
3662709 my vote was devised in a way to divide that requested space that would have surpassed the space available in the courthouse
3662710 what i didnt factor in was the high degree of emotional attachment to the courthouse i sometimes dont give enough credence to that im a nuts and bolts kind of guy
3662711 we were shown the inside of the building and the space to see if it would be anything wed be interested in for a tourism office
3662712 we were given a tour of what areas they thought would be under consideration for tourism space there was no guarantees made or any offers it was very informal
3662713 we have a space in city hall that works very well
3662714 but should space be available in the courthouse we feel that would be a prime location for a tourism office
3662715 we just had too much information given to us about this incident to ignore it
3662716 we are concerned about the appearance this meeting gives to us as a newspaper to our readers and the citizens of lafayette county we would like an opinion on this matter from the ethics commission
3662717 prior to going in we decided due to the nature of the building it was strictly a tour a review of the facilities
3662718 we made a special note to ourselves to not discuss any county business nor make any decisions that could be construed as official business

3662736 it is remarkable but probably inevitable that so many in washington have reacted with surprise and outrage to russias response to president mikheil saakashvilis attempt to reestablish georgian control over south ossetia by force some of the angriest statements come from those inside and outside the bush administration who contributed i assume unwittingly to making this crisis happen and like post wmd justifications for the invasion of iraq the people demanding the toughest action against russia are focused on russias lack of democracy and heavy handed conduct particularly in its own neighborhood and away from how the confrontation actually unfolded likewise just as in the case of saddam hussein these same people accuse anyone who points out that things are not exactly black and white and that the u s government may have its own share of responsibility for the crisis of siding with aggressive tyrants in this case in the kremlin

3662742 so to all those reporting i was taken out in hand cuffs i assure you i walked out with no cuffs carrying my bags from the npc i also feel it important to state that the npc staff conducted themselves with nothing short of kindness and professionalism from the moment i arrive to the moment i left
3662743 the npc without a doubt had made arrangements with dc metro police to take me into custody after the pc they were even parked in our mine and the npcs planned exit route from the building after the pc was over it is clear the npc had arranged for the pc to tak place and i was even escorted to the restroom and back to an enclosed room pending the start of the pc
3662744 upon my return to delaware i appeared before a superior court judge at 2 30 pm at which time i was released on pr bond and released i will say that the charge is questionable at best and after speaking with my attorney i will allow him her decide what can and cannot be posted here
3662745 i have been convicted and served prison sentences for writing bad checks forging checks using stolen credit card numbers in arizona florida and colorado these events occurred over twenty 20 years ago between 1980 thru 1986

3662747 there is some question as to whether he is eating occasionally
3662748 he is alleging that the staff put it there and we do have an investigation under way into that allegation

3662762 ich kann mich an eine katholische frau erinnern sie hat immer wieder den namen jesu und mariens ausgesprochen
3662763 aber auch das hat sie nicht stoppen k nnen sie hat dann mit ihrem eigenen blut sich selber den namen jesu und mariens ins eigene fleisch geschrieben
3662764 sie banden ihr die h nde und f e hinter den r cken zusammen und sperrten sie in einen k fig der so mit stangen versehen war da sie sich weder setzen noch hinlegen konnte
3662765 so ist sie gestorben den k rper blut berstr mt die lippen zugen ht f r die ewigkeit
3662766 der k fig stand ganze sechs wochen vor dem gef ngnis der tod durch die h nde ihrer peiniger wurde f r sie zur befreiung in das reich gottes
3662767 nach dem gebetsverbot folgte das sprechverbot wohl nur aus reiner vergeltungssucht
3662768 im gef ngnis waren wir auf eine sehr strenge di t gesetzt der tee hier ist eine volle mahlzeit verglichen mit dem was man mir dort acht jahre lang gegeben hat
3662769 tag ein tag aus waren wir gezwungen dieselbe ungenie bare wassersuppe zu trinken in der gerade mal zwei maisk rner schwammen
3662770 nach einem monat waren meine beine derma en geschwollen da ich nicht mehr stehen konnte in meinen gelenken sp re ich das noch heute
3662771 ich kann ihnen sagen mein magen hat sich in den letzten zwanzig jahren wieder erholt
3662772 mit meinen achtzig jahren kann ich heute wieder alles essen was ich m chte damit habe ich keine probleme mehr
3662773 da wir arbeiten mu ten waren sie gezwungen uns wenigstens ein bi chen brot mit der suppe zu geben
3662774 eine strafminderung bekam ich nicht und habe die ganzen 19 jahre und zwei monate im gef ngnis verbracht
3662775 denn fast die h lfte aller leistungseinbr che im sport sind auf ern hrungsfehler zur ckzuf hren
3662776 ein ern hrungsplan hilft nicht nur spitzensportlern ihr leistungs maximum zu halten sondern ist auch f r freizeitsportler wichtig
3662777 besonders wichtig ist es dass sie immer rechtzeitig und ausreichend trinken und dabei dem k rper die mineralstoffe und spurenelemente wieder zuf hren die er beim schwitzen verliert
3662778 bereits unter normalen bedingungen scheidet der k rper zweieinhalb liter wasser t glich aus bei hitze und anstrengung entsprechend mehr wird die fl ssigkeit nicht regelm ig ersetzt nimmt die leistungsf higkeit ab und im schlimmsten fall bricht der organismus zusammen
3662779 wer sichergehen m chte dass er gen gend mineralstoffe bekommt kann zu einem mineraldrink greifen
3662780 und denken sie bitte daran dass auch bier oder kaffee nach dem sport keine geeigneten durstl scher sind denn koffein und alkohol steigern die wasserausscheidung der nieren und erh hen auf diese weise sogar noch den fl ssigkeitsbedarf

3662794 nobody is going to say you are not supposed to appear but i would say i wasnt necessarily encouraged
3662795 it appears to be consistent with the previous indication that proposed witnesses had given us
3662796 this is a serious matter it has to do with interfering with witnesses this is a committee of parliament
3662797 the chair of a standing committee does not have the authority to take any further steps with regard to this matter
3662798 that the party wasnt really thrilled for you to go
3662799 i am telling you very clearly the national party did not tell any of the witnesses to ignore their summons
3662800 i resent profoundly that the conservative advised lowry whether or not he should attend attending a parliamentary committee is not optional and i resent profoundly them offering him talking points trying to guide what he should and should not say
3662801 i still think it is a valid thing to do
3662802 thats why were doing this project i was hoping to get this done before things like this happened again
3662803 to point fingers at anybody at this point we just dont know
3662804 we have a significant robust safety system in place today
3662805 its absolutely insane and woefully inadequate if youve set yourself up as the public safety watchdog for that industry sector
3662806 i think what this has shown us is the approved regulator may well be asleep at the switch
3662807 we need to understand what caused the explosion to understand how we can best move to protect the residents of toronto
3662808 people who have never seen anyone else show these expressions they have the same behavioural responses
3662809 an emotion like fear or anger you dont have to think about who you are
3662810 with pride you do im experiencing these emotions because i just did something that makes me feel good about myself
3662811 if you have a success its really important that other people in the group know that
3662812 pride is a clear signal look at me im powerful
3662813 in western cultures people dont talk about their shame whereas in eastern cultures especially asian cultures shame is an essential part of the cultural fabric
3662814 the decrease in sales stems from an ongoing decline in the level of consumer confidence in canada as well as a decline in housing starts and resale of single unit homes especially in alberta
3662815 this situation combined with a decrease in housing starts and resale of single unit homes in canada especially in alberta will continue to put downward pressure on sales in our industry
3662816 housing prices affect consumer confidence so when you have a big boom like weve had in edmonton for the past four or five years people start to feel a little wealthier
3662817 theres a combination of things that are hurting consumer confidence right now like higher gas prices and housing would add to that
3662818 even though both companies are well run when the economy changes especially the housing economy and your business is home renovation and improvement thats going to hurt you more than it hurts even a wal mart that has some exposure to that hard goods category but has a lot of other categories to offset it
3662819 although our sales continue to be strong we are concerned about a general slowdown in the economy
3662820 i wanted the world record i wanted a 1 51 or better but given the circumstances its not too bad i guess
3662821 if theyve established a presence overseas and marketed themselves properly i dont think a rise in the dollars value is going to be devastating to manufacturing in our region

3662830 although it is at an early stage if results in patients are good it could be very important especially because these drugs would not have to be approved by the national institute for health and clinical excellence
3662831 we didnt see any new looting at the eight sites which was really very very encouraging
3662832 if there was major recent looting there we would have expected to find it
3662833 but i didnt see anything that was there in late 2003 or early 2004
3662834 tens of thousands of military boots tramping over an archaeological site is not what we want
3662835 the ongoing problem is not so much looting or military damage it is the fact that these sites have faced 30 years of neglect

3662960 jelaskan bagaimana mengukur tinggi suatu bangunan pencakar langit dengan menggunakan sebuah barometer
3662961 ikatlah leher barometer itu dengan seutas tali panjang lalu turunkan barometer dari pucuk gedung pencakar langit sampai menyentuh tanah panjang tali ditambah panjang barometer akan sama dengan tinggi pencakar langit
3662962 pertama tama ambillah barometer dan bawalah sampai ke atap pencakar langit lemparkan ke tanah lalu ukurlah waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk mencapai tanah ketinggian bangunan bisa dihitung dari rumus h 0 5 x g x t kwadrat tetapi khan sayang barometernya jadi pecah
3662963 atau bila matahari sedang bersinar anda bisa mengukur tinggi barometer tegakkan di atas tanah dan ukurlah panjang bayangannya setelah itu ukurlah panjang bayangan pencakar langit sehingga hanya perlu perhitungan aritmatika proporsional secara sederhana untuk menetapkan ketinggian pencakar langitnya
3662964 tapi kalau anda betul betul ingin jawaban ilmiah anda bisa mengikat seutas tali pendek pada barometer dan menggoyangkannya seperti pendulum mula mula lakukan itu di permukaan tanah lalu di atas pencakar langit ketinggian pencakar langit bisa dihitung atas dasar perbedaan kekuatan gravitasi t 2 phi akar dari l g
3662965 atau kalau pencakar langitnya memiliki tangga darurat di bagian luar akan mudah sekali untuk menaiki tangga lalu menggunakan panjangnya barometer sebagai satuan ukuran pada dinding bangunan sehingga tinggi pencakar langit penjumlahan seluruh satuan barometernya pada dinding pencakar langit
3662966 bila anda hanya ingin membosankan dan bersikap ortodoks tentunya anda akan menggunakan barometer untuk mengukur tekanan udara pada atap pencakar langit dan di permukaan tanah lalu mengkonversikan perbedaannya dari milibar ke satuan panjang untuk memperoleh ketinggian bangunan
3662967 tetapi karena kita senantiasa ditekankan agar menggunakan kebebasan berpikir dan menerapkan metoda metoda ilmiah tentunya cara paling tepat adalah mengetuk pintu pengelola gedung dan mengatakan bila anda menginginkan barometer baru saya yang cantik ini saya akan memberikannya pada anda jika anda memberitahukan kepada saya berapa ketinggian pencakar langit ini

3663045 estamos visitando algunos de los pa ses que el che guevara recorri en su viaje en motocicleta por am rica latina deseamos informar sobre la situaci n social y pol tica de la regi n en nuestro pa s queremos hablar con trabajadores y activistas sociales y con personas involucradas en distintas luchas ahora en primer lugar hacemos manifiesta nuestra solidaridad con la documentalista elena varela y apoyamos la campa a por su liberaci n exigimos la inmediata liberaci n de elena varela y la devoluci n de todo su material f lmico tambi n deseamos expresar nuestra solidaridad con la lucha del pueblo mapuche por la tierra y por la justicia durante muchos a os el partido socialista irland s ha participado en muchas campa as y batallas hace cinco a os cuando era diputado en el parlamento irland s pas un mes en prisi n por muchos siglos el pueblo irland s ha luchado fuertemente contra el imperialismo como los mapuche y los pueblos originarios en toda latinoam rica
3663046 en irlanda la gente le tiene un gran respeto al che por su consecuencia de lucha por su relevante papel en la revoluci n cubana porque muri en bolivia manteniendo sus principios y jam s se corrompi especialmente entre los j venes el che es una figura muy respetada cada a o en irlanda se organiza una manifestaci n por la muerte del che el 2007 asistieron 200 j venes lo que para un tema que pudiera parecer tan distante es mucha gente pol ticamente nosotros pensamos que fue un error del che tratar de replicar en bolivia la idea del foco guerrillero y que m s bien hubiera sido preferible e interesante que se hubiera involucrado con las organizaciones de la clase obrera boliviana especialmente con los mineros
3663047 hace 10 a os hab a en irlanda un gran crecimiento eran los primeros tiempos del neoliberalismo en nuestro pa s no obstante ahora existe una gran crisis econ mica el gobierno irland s actual es de derecha y su pol tica neoliberal es muy parecida a la chilena pero creo que ahora las cosas van a cambiar mucho sobre todo en los a os venideros porque las condiciones de los j venes y trabajadores sufrir n importantes modificaciones
3663048 en irlanda tenemos un gran problema porque los dirigentes de los sindicatos tienen acuerdos con el gobierno y con los patrones los dirigentes no quieren luchar contra el neoliberalismo en realidad el partido laborista por ejemplo que en la actualidad se encuentra en la oposici n se ha convertido en un partido capitalista es decir que el pueblo irland s necesita un nuevo partido para los trabajadores pero no es f cil la tarea sin embargo yo creo que es nuestra responsabilidad procurar la creaci n de un nuevo instrumento pol tico con el fin de vehicular la lucha de los j venes y los trabajadores contra el neoliberalismo
3663049 yo fui diputado de la rep blica desde 1997 hasta el 2007 all fui el nico diputado del partido socialista los dem s parlamentarios de los llamados partidos de oposici n no lo eran realmente entonces yo levant una oposici n muy fuerte contra la pol tica neoliberal del gobierno apoyando la lucha de los trabajadores y por eso soy conocido en el pa s
3663050 hace 5 a os ten amos una campa a contra un impuesto por la recolecci n de la basura dom stica que ya estaba pagada por el impuesto global as que era una doble imposici n para nosotros era el primer cap tulo de una serie de impuestos subsiguientes a los servicios p blicos organizamos protestas y manifestaciones hasta que a trav s de una orden judicial se me emplaz a terminar con la agitaci n en torno al impuesto pero nos negamos a terminar las movilizaciones lo que me cost un mes de presidio
3663051 la explotaci n de trabajadores extranjeros en irlanda en un gran problema los inmigrantes provienen de los pa ses del este europeo debido a ello luchamos contra su explotaci n y hace 3 a os hubo un gran esc ndalo al respecto mil trabajadores de turqu a laboraban en el rea de la construcci n en p simas condiciones la explotaci n ocurr a de manera soterrada y conseguimos que 600 obreros votaran la huelga de esta manera con los trabajadores irlandeses y mi situaci n en el parlamento conseguimos 30 millones de euros de la compa a para los trabajadores
3663052 todo ha sido muy dif cil el pr ximo a o hay elecciones municipales y esperamos reunir en la campa a muchas iniciativas y luchas pero todav a no sabemos qu pasar yo pienso volver a participar en las elecciones parlamentarias
3663053 en irlanda el neoliberalismo se expresa a trav s de una mayor explotaci n de los trabajadores sobre los que cae una gran presi n hoy se est atacando el mbito de la pensi n y la extensi n de la jornada laboral de hecho ahora en irlanda mientras vivimos la primera ola de la recesi n los patrones quieren imponer un congelamiento salarial
3663054 la inmensa mayor a de la educaci n escolar y universitaria es de propiedad estatal hay algunos colegios privados pero s lo son para los m s ricos no es nada similar al caso chileno sin embargo hoy el gobierno ya est hablando de recortes de presupuesto para el sector
3663055 en la salud hay muchos problemas no hay recursos suficientes y el gobierno pretende privatizar sectores del servicio a trav s de contratos a empresas norteamericanas que est n construyendo nuevos hospitales
3663056 en el tema previsional los trabajadores del estado tienen pensiones p blicas y los trabajadores privados tienen pensiones privadas de todos modos al cumplir 66 a os de edad todos los trabajadores reciben una pensi n fiscal no es muy grande pero si la gente mayor no tiene que pagar alquiler o hipotecas alcanza para vivir en todo caso es muy caro vivir en irlanda los precios son muy altos comprar una casa para los j venes es casi imposible en los 10 ltimos a os las casas para los trabajadores han aumentado su precio 4 veces los padres de los j venes irlandeses de la actualidad ten an hipotecas por 20 a os ahora la duraci n de las hipotecas para los j venes llega a los 40 a os debido a la especulaci n auspiciada por el gobierno
3663057 es obvio advertir en chile que la vida es muy dif cil para mucha gente
3663058 s es posible el socialismo en irlanda hoy se est n viviendo grandes cambios mundiales debido a la crisis de origen norteamericano los trabajadores y los j venes est n pensando seriamente en la nueva situaci n econ mica y creo que en este sentido la conciencia va a cambiar es decir que habr mejores oportunidades para los socialistas para construir un nuevo movimiento lo mismo pienso que ocurrir en otros pa ses de europa
3663059 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3663060 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3663061 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3663062 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3663063 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3663064 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3663065 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3663066 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3663067 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3663068 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3663069 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3663070 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3663071 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3663081 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3663082 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3663083 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3663084 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3663085 it gave us a chance to sort of spend the week sort of officially welcoming cbc aboard
3663086 we made a daily mention of it and did some canadian fun facts because im sure you know a lot of americans are not necessarily well versed in what goes on north of their border we had fun with that
3663087 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3663088 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3663089 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3663090 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3663091 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3663092 there is merit in looking at how we make sure there is a proper international presence there
3663093 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3663094 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century

3663097 i have told him krishnamurthy to come to delhi at the earliest to hold his inquiry and to favour me with his report and recommendations at the earliest
3663098 as sports minister while i am determined to set up an independent technically proficient dope testing mechanism which has credibility in the world i am also anxious that no sports person should suffer due to any laxity or delay on the part of this testing mechanism
3663099 it shall be known that in 2008 the world will be blessed

3663162 thoughts such as losing your job being homeless falling and being chased are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3663163 for example dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life the attacker or falling in the dream represents the emotion of fear and anxiety

3663263 menurut saya keberhasilan persitara meraih angka ketika menahan persik patut diwaspadai setelah mengalami serangkaian kekalahan itu hasil positif buat persitara karena itu saya sangat mewaspadai kebangkitan persitara
3663264 ketika opsi bertanding tanpa penonton di stadion siliwangi belum muncul persiapan menghadapi persitara sesuai dengan jadwal tetap saya lakukan sekarang setelah ada sinyal bisa bertanding persiapan kita jelas lebih fokus
3663265 kita lebih senang dengan adanya opsi itu meski tanpa penonton yang penting buat kita pertandingan bisa berjalan dengan lancar
3663266 ketika kita main di solo lawan persik red itu kan tanpa penonton juga jadi sama saja dengan sekarang lawan persitara red tapi sekarang tidak akan menghadapi kendala kelelahan dan pembiayaan

3663268 if crude oil prices come down to 100 certainly it will lift the stock markets in india
3663269 crude prices have corrected in a big way in the last four weeks with prices finding support at 112 65 now there is no reason why the stock market should not rise
3663270 we still expect oil prices to decline over the course of 2009
3663271 the high level of oil prices should induce demand side adjustments

3663291 politicians have been on the project of supporting democracy in the former soviet union without thinking of the impact in russia now were seeing a reaction

3663295 over recent weeks the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen considerably this rates often used as an indicator of banks marginal cost of funds particularly at the short end
3663296 looking over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rates down around half a per cent so thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3663297 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3663298 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a seven per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3663299 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers

3663332 charter schools are swamped with applications from skilled teachers who appreciate freedom from a system designed to smother change and most important they offer choice to families whose school placement is governed now entirely by address
3663333 all told roughly 40 of the 50 charters whose students took the exams beat the citywide averages a number that is all the more astonishing because the schools are located primarily in the poorest neighborhoods
3663334 if we continue to rank our students only against each other within the country we will have no way of knowing how we compare with those overseas many of whom will ultimately compete with american students for jobs
3663335 where the gap between the privileged and the unprivileged really is a travesty is in educational opportunity i recently heard washington d c chancellor rhee speak in boston ms rhee speaks plainly there are two basic problems in the d c schools 1 no accountability 2 the interest of adults always takes precedence over the interest of children who have no voice there are two solutions 1 good leadership 2 great teachers
3663336 college students and younger teachers will crave the chance to earn say 150 000 if they excel he can explicitly endorse something like the breakthrough deal being pushed by washington d c schools chief michelle rhee under which teachers could opt into a new pay schedule that gives them a chance to earn up to 130 000 but requires them to relinquish tenure and seniority rights as part of the bargain
3663337 our students arent achieving not because of their aptitude but because we as the adults in this system are not doing our jobs to serve them well
3663338 ultimately we are changing the system so that it is no longer about the needs and preferences of adults but rather about what we owe our kids
3663339 when political will backs the innovative practices and courage needed for reform it absolutely is possible to turn around a school system
3663340 while i would recommend revisions to no child left behind legislation that would encourage the benefits of performance pay increase support for struggling schools and motivate high performance in addition to ensuring baseline requirements i am convinced that the firm accountability measures that no child left behind introduced must be preserved
3663341 alternative education advocates scored a huge victory last week when a key house committee approved mayoral academies a new class of public schools free from union structures allowing them to experiment with longer school days and 10 month academic years

3663355 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play

3663442 predominava la rabbia dopo il fallimento nei 400 e lho trasformata in oro e ho seguito il mio istinto
3663443 non era una problema facile sul piano psicologico ma siamo riusciti a risolverlo
3663444 era un problema di tattica di gara abbiamo deciso di fare la gara di testa come la primatista del mondo deve fare
3663445 sotto avevo ladidas dallenamento sopra quello da gara lho fatto per evitare sorprese

3663448 un tercera l nea muy placador que tambi n salta bien en la touch
3663449 es un jugador de mucha experiencia que viene a reforzar nuestra delantera
3663450 un muy buen jugador como as demuestra su curr culum dado que estuvo incluido en la primera lista de cuarenta jugadores de la selecci n argentina previa al mundial
3663451 no buscamos nada pero si algo tiene que venir a lo largo de la temporada bienvenido sea
3663452 estamos contentos con lo que tenemos pero las lesiones en una temporada tan dura como la que se nos presenta con m s partidos que nunca son las que nos marcar n futuras incorporaciones
3663453 tambi n hay que ir metiendo a la gente joven que viene pisando fuerte
3663454 let me know when youre collecting food and goods i want to help
3663455 the health certificate was rejected as they felt it was discriminating against the models
3663456 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion
3663457 british people have a reputation of being bad between the sheets and it now seems in some respects that it is correct
3663458 while our euro neighbours seem to see sex as one long indulgence many of us just want a drunken quickie before we nod off to sleep
3663459 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3663460 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3663461 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3663462 having been poor is no shame but being ashamed of it is
3663463 the parole conditions were similar to the good behaviour bond which she cannot sign
3663464 youre saying mrs rainima has a right which is god given which it is the states duty to uphold
3663465 the appeal against conviction is one that i can deal with if it is purely on a question of law
3663466 what youre really saying is mrs rainima wasnt given adequate opportunity to pursue the constitutional question before the magistrate
3663467 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
3663468 we are seeing continued growth and expansion in the north this is particularly evident in engineering the drinks industry hospitality and renewable energy sectors these sectors are showing no sign of slowing in fact we have seen considerable investment in the businesses and the people within these industries our increased business is also a reflection of a move towards the internet as a favoured method of job search
3663469 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3663470 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3663471 writing books is the closest men ever come to childbearing
3663472 there is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge
3663473 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3663474 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3663475 weve a uefa cup bid and thats going to put a strain on us with the amount of games and the size of our squad
3663476 middlesbrough proved in 2006 you can go so far in the uefa cup but unless you win it it becomes a bit of a fruitless task
3663477 its going to be important we keep our players fit to do well in europe and on the other front to do well in the league
3663478 as we found in the fa cup last season it is easy to take your eye off your league position
3663479 la seguridad de nuestras fuerzas de paz y de los civiles fue restablecida
3663480 el agresor fue castigado y sufri p rdidas muy significativas sus fuerzas armadas fueron desorganizadas
3663481 ante cualesquiera fuentes emergentes de resistencia o cualesquiera acciones agresivas deben adoptar medidas para destruirlas
3663482 rusia ha invadido a un vecino estado soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico elegido por su pueblo semejante acci n es inaceptable en el siglo xxi
3663483 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3663484 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3663485 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3663486 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3663487 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3663488 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3663489 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3663506 las tropas terrestres rusas avanzan en diversas direcciones por ejemplo hacia poti junto al puerto de poti en el mar los rusos destruyeron nuestros buques
3663507 es nuestro deber apoyar al gobierno leg timo de georgia que fue elegido por su pueblo

3663525 von vielen ecken der sp von der gewerkschaft ber staatssekret r matznetter bis zu minister buchinger wurde immer wieder betont dass nach ihrer meinung der wegfall der erbschafts und schenkungssteuer ein fehler war sp chef faymann soll daher endlich klartext reden wird unter seiner f hrung die erbschafts und schenkungssteuer und somit eine belastung f r die menschen wieder eingef hrt das sollten die w hlerinnen und w hler wissen
3663526 die vp hat sich klar f r die ersatzlose streichung der erbschafts und schenkungssteuer eingesetzt und betont wie wichtig und notwendig das f r den wirtschaftsstandort sterreich ist
3663527 so viel ist klar die vp will die menschen entlasten die sp will die menschen belasten das kommt f r uns nicht in frage
3663528 die ils gruppe bietet ein fl chendeckendes service in sterreich und ein deutlich gr eres produkt spektrum damit ist f r unsere kunden k nftig noch besseres service garantiert
3663529 wir sind jetzt autorisierter partner f hrender hersteller f r h chstleistungsdrucker und verst rken mit dieser akquisition unsere kompetenz im peripherie und servicebereich

3663541 we love ella a tribute to the first lady of song
3663542 wir nehmen unsere rolle als controller im gesundheitswesen sehr ernst und setzen alle hebel in bewegung um ein ausgeglichenes ergebnis zu schaffen heuer wird es sehr schwierig weil wir derzeit zwar ein sattes beitragsplus von 6 4 prozent haben gleichzeitig aber die medikamentenkosten um 8 3 prozent steigen
3663543 was uns zu schaffen macht sind die enormen j hrlichen kostensteigerungen bei den medikamenten 2007 waren es plus 9 4 prozent heuer rechnen wir mit einer hnlichen steigerung von 1997 bis 2007 sind die medikamentenkosten um 94 prozent gestiegen das ist fast eine verdopplung
3663544 die selbstverwaltung in der o gebietskrankenkasse hat verantwortung bernommen und erfolgreich gewirtschaftet dort wo wir handlungsm glichkeiten haben haben wir unsere hausaufgaben mehr als vollst ndig erledigt es wird h chste zeit dass auch die politik zum arbeiten bergeht und in ihrem bereich handlungen setzt
3663545 aber von dort kommt nichts au er netten w nschen
3663546 nat rlich analysiert die o gkk alle finanziell wichtigen trends sehr genau an erster stelle die medikamentenkosten die drei wichtigsten faktoren sind menge preis und die demografie
3663547 die steigende lebenserwartung bringt erfreulicher weise auch einen gewinn an gesunden behinderungsfreien lebensjahren das wird sich nach unseren aktuellen analysen aber nicht d mpfend auf die medikamenten kostendynamik auswirken
3663548 wenn krebspatienten ihre chemotherapie zu hause einnehmen k nnen und keine infusionen mehr brauchen so ist das ein enormer fortschritt allerdings verlagern sich hier gut f nf millionen euro von den spit lern zu uns das werfe ich weder den spit lern noch dem land vor es passt nur nicht zum viel zitierten mythos die krankenkassen w rden ihre kosten in die spit ler verlagern
3663549 hier brauchen wir strengere pr fungen was in den medikamentenkatalog der krankenkassen kommt und was gleich drau en bleibt wir wollen keine marketingschm hs auf kosten der beitragszahler sondern moderne und wirksame heilmittel f r unsere versicherten
3663550 gemeinsam mit den o rzten haben wir viel erreicht wir gehen auch verst rkt auf die patienten zu um ihre akzeptanz f r die gemeinsamen steuerungsma nahmen f r einen sorgf ltigeren einsatz von medikamenten zu gewinnen wir brauchen jetzt aber auch eine politik die ihre hausaufgaben erledigt

3663553 der vorschlag von vp nationalratspr sident michael spindelegger am mittwoch morgen ein kindergartenjahr kostenfrei verpflichtend einzuf hren ist ganz auf linie der sp

3663557 alle politiker sind dazu gestanden den paula gesch digten bauern in k rnten rasch zu helfen bz und sp halten nicht was sie versprochen haben bei den entsch digungs zahlungen klafft ein loch von 5 mio euro
3663558 haider und rohr sollen sich an ihre versprechen erinnern und die fehlenden und dringend notwendigen 5 mio euro endlich freigeben
3663559 bz und sp blockieren und lassen die bauern im regen stehen und jahrelang auf die entsch digungen warten
3663560 die angeblich kr ftige ausweitung der holzimporte chinas und indiens hat berhaupt keine auswirkung auf den sterreichischen rundholzpreis
3663561 daraus die schlussfolgerung zu ziehen dass die sterreichischen rundholzpreise unmittelbar steigen werden ist falsch
3663562 haiders sch nrede presseaussendung zum k rntner arbeitsmarkt ist das papier nicht wert auf dem sie steht
3663563 der landeshauptmann von k rnten der nur noch f r klamotten fotos in k rnten unterwegs ist hat die arbeit f r k rnten schon l ngst aufgegeben
3663564 schritt in die richtige richtung aber auch die letzten schlupfl cher m ssen geschlossen werden
3663565 angesichts der schlechten arbeitsbedingungen der spitals rzte ist die novelle ein schritt in die richtige richtung es ist aber sicher nicht der letzte der erfolgen muss es gibt noch viel zu tun
3663566 und dann werden wir uns anschauen ob das gesetz auch einen kraftvollen biss entfaltet oder nur ein papiertiger bleibt
3663567 den geist der novelle durch aktivit ten zur verbesserung unserer arbeitsbedingungen auf ihrer seite weiterzutragen
3663568 da die jung rzte auch zu den hauptleidtragenden berlanger arbeitszeiten geh ren wird die novelle hoffentlich etwas entlastung bringen es bleibt aber das problem der berfrachtung mit dokumentationsaufgaben das auch f r den mittelbau in den spit lern gilt
3663569 im bevorstehenden kindergartenjahr 2008 09 versuchen wir es noch mit appellen weil wir davon ausgehen dass eltern das beste f r ihr kind wollen sollten die nicht fruchten muss sich die regierung andere ma nahmen berlegen
3663570 aber ich w re als landeshauptfrau von salzburg unter der voraussetzung eines verpflichtenden vorschuljahres bereit dass wir daf r die kinderg rten gratis anbieten
3663571 dieses eine vorschuljahr wurde von der sp dringend gefordert claudia schmied hat sich bem ht und bem ht und von der vp kam immer nur ein nein
3663572 denn nur weil in wien viele zuwandererkinder nicht deutsch k nnen brauchen wir kein verpflichtendes vorschuljahr f r alle kinder in ganz sterreich
3663573 eine zwangsbegl ckung wie das die sozialisten wollen wird es mit uns nicht geben
3663574 diese praxis war sachlich nicht zu rechtfertigen und diente lediglich der gewinnmaximierung des unternehmens es ist erfreulich dass auch das gericht solche methoden missbilligt und im interesse des kunden mehr transparenz einfordert

3663580 great asset to our business firepower at a crucial time for the economy the world over

3663583 there couldnt be a better time to be covering business
3663584 lo m s preocupante es la subida del componente subyacente sobre todo porque en un contexto de d bil crecimiento una espiral alcista de precios puede ser un escollo para el conjunto de la econom a y sobre todo para el mbito empresarial
3663585 la subida de la inflaci n subyacente es el peor aspecto porque es un riesgo que apunta a efectos de segunda vuelta pero sigo pensando que la bajada del componente energ tico desde los pr ximos meses y la debilidad de la demanda har que ese repunte subyacente no se consolide
3663586 en nuestras previsiones esperamos que inflaci n alcance su m ximo en agosto del 5 4 por ciento y baje al 4 3 por ciento 4 4 por ciento en los tres ltimos meses
3663587 el aspecto positivo de esto es que probablemente hemos llegado al techo del a o y a partir de aqu cabe esperar una reducci n de la tasa interanual

3663606 he has taken advantage of an opportunity here it will be interesting to see how he does
3663607 you could tell when a guy learns every day and gets it and starts making plays and doesnt make the same mistake
3663608 hes willing to learn and if theres somebody im willing to pass the torch to its definitely him
3663609 i think hell be here hes just quiet soft spoken always seen not heard i love those type of guys i hope he carries it over in the game because he deserves it
3663610 coach andy reid has put a lot of time into that and he is on top of it he will tell me when that time occurs
3663611 i have talked to shawn but i have not discussed at all his return on the field
3663612 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge
3663613 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
3663614 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god
3663615 i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood
3663616 this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come
3663617 what a great priest he could be for the church
3663618 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves
3663619 there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
3663620 thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god
3663621 in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men making the word of god of none effect through your tradition
3663622 and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ
3663623 then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ
3663624 o come let us sing unto the lord the rock of our salvation
3663625 there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god
3663626 for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ
3663627 unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed
3663628 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man
3663629 the scriptures and tradition are one in the same but when contradictions arise tradition is to rule over the bible
3663630 and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book
3663631 christ hath forgiven us all trespasses the blood of the lord jesus christ has cleansed us from all sin
3663632 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
3663633 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
3663634 you mean one small sin is like committing murder or adultery
3663635 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness
3663636 examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your ownselves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates
3663637 full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition making the word of god of none effect through your tradition mark 7 9 13 verse 13 has been quoted twice in this testimony for a good reason for there was where i lived
3663638 brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved
3663639 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
3663640 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us
3663641 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
3663642 verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
3663643 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
3663644 whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved
3663645 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation
3663646 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3663647 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3663648 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3663649 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3663650 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3663651 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3663652 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3663653 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3663654 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3663655 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
3663656 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out i think i need to spend two or three days campaigning they said no
3663657 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3663658 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3663659 i just figured if i was going to make the world a better place i was going to do it with cookies
3663660 at the same time im looking forward to it just in the fact that ive known for a long time i wanted to be in the army and serve my country
3663661 ive tried to protect him for 24 years and now i guess its his turn

3663664 im not going to lie and say its easy preparing to go to iraq
3663665 but at the same time everyones here because we chose to be we made that choice and we decided these are the sacrifices were going to make
3663666 my wife and i got married about five or six months ago
3663667 im going to spend my first anniversary away from her thats going to be hard for both of us
3663668 you dont want to think about it but its reality
3663669 when you hear about women who are widows at 23 with a baby you dont want that to be you being only 23 and sending your husband off to war is a terrifying thought but its his job and its what hes always wanted to do
3663670 what i try to tell my wife before i go is just live your life as if i was not around which is true
3663671 i dont want her to miss me everyday dont think about me all the time she needs to just kinda carry on with her life as its supposed to be
3663672 you know you want to get the same person back that you sent
3663673 i know that is tough for a lot of soldiers after being in a combat situation to return with the same kind of heart that they went with
3663674 zachs just such a good person that we just want that same person to come back whole in all ways physically and mentally
3663675 peoples lives depend on it and thats really scary to think that whether i say do this or do that someone could potentially get out just fine or be seriously injured
3663676 most people as soon as they come home at the end of the day their professional life stops and their personal life begins but for us its not that easy
3663677 its going to be really hard but really worth it
3663678 i kept on telling my staff im worried about hawaii
3663679 its going to be really embarrassing if we dont pull it out i think i need to spend two or three days campaigning they said no

3663687 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3663688 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining signs and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection highlighting advances in research and treatment and presenting stories of hope and survival
3663689 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3663690 lung cancer has been the poor relation for too long and we need to work with the media to bring attention to advances in research treatment and services for people with the disease
3663691 the media has the power to increase awareness and inform people about lung cancer and in doing so become an informed voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years
3663692 we have two people from francistown and kasane who are also the victims thus our investigations are still on going
3663693 as an administration anchored on the rule of law we desire to achieve zero tolerance for corruption by prosecuting the war on corruption within the ambit of the law we can fight this crime and enforce the law within the ambit of our constitution
3663694 if we must take our proper place as a nation we must without delay do away with this evil we cannot attain our vision of being one of the greatest 20 economies in the world by 2020 if we dont do away with corruption our commitment to the eradication of corruption is therefore total

3663698 based on discussions with customers and potential customers and visits to several power and coke construction projects i came away convinced that the worlds need for coal will continue to grow at a rapid rate the high quality and diversity of the coal we produce as well as our leading market position in central appalachia will enable us to compete effectively to serve these growing export energy markets we are very pleased with our market and production positions and our opportunities to grow our business with both new and existing customers we are particularly pleased to have reached agreements on several multi year deals to supply coal to asian customers

3663707 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people rightly
3663708 that is a reversion to not just cold war politics it is nineteenth century way of doing politics
3663709 i think it is very very important at a european level but also at the un that we assert that that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century

3663748 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3663749 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

3663753 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3663754 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3663755 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition

3663770 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters

3663810 this was different to birkdale id been very comfortable with my game but at oakland hills i wasnt happy with the way id been swinging the golf club something had me a little off my stride in terms of my focus or maybe dehydration or tiredness
3663811 once i got to the weekend it was a question of the adrenaline keeping me going though id shot 66 in the third round i went out there on sunday afternoon not 100pc sure of what lay ahead so i kept to my game plan kept hitting my shots i hit it in close at the first struck a nice putt and missed
3663812 i trailed sergio from early on but i know from experience that nobody goes without making some mistakes at a major as long as i could hang in there i knew id get my opportunity i made a good two putt from the front edge of the green
3663813 i had a chance for birdie on three and four i hit a good putt there and was surprised it missed
3663814 i hit a poor shot i let it go in the wind when i was trying to hold it up and didnt get up and down
3663815 i was very happy with this birdie i hit a good drive and a good bunker shot from 35 yards to four feet and holed it
3663816 i made a good up and down again and from 35 yards as well
3663817 sergio got up and down from awkward positions on eight and nine and it was looking like his day but i thought to myself just hang in there and youll get an opportunity obviously that opportunity came
3663818 it all starts when you get to the back nine on sunday at a major i hit a nice eight iron in here and was probably a little unlucky to come up 15 feet short but i holed that putt and it got me on a run
3663819 i was a little bit unlucky for it to hang up on the right hand side
3663820 that second shot was intimidating but i knew i needed to take it on at that stage i hit a nice shot over the green and then thought i might hole the chip
3663821 this had been a difficult hole all week and its very tight up at the back there but it worked out a nice yardage i kept it down under the wind hit it to 15 feet and my eye was in at that stage
3663822 i wasnt sure if it was nine or an eight iron coming out of the rough so i tried an eight and it came out a little quick and went over the green into an awkward lie i chipped to eight feet and hit a weak putt
3663823 obviously i hit a nice seven iron in there i had a good opportunity for birdie but hit it through the break
3663824 i had about 135 yards after a good tee shot i tried to draw a three quarter eight iron and overcooked it a bit i wasnt happy but took on the 29 yard bunker shot i was unlucky to catch a stone between my ball and the club and it released to about 20 feet i knew i had to hole it and i did
3663825 i was delighted to have the opportunity to get my putt in first it was pure match play i knew if i holed it id win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt
3663826 its nice when you see the line straight away on a putt youve got to hole it was an easy read a double break and slightly downhill so i didnt want to hit it too hard i just rolled it down there a cup right of the hole and it broke to just outside the left edge then thankfully it just got inside the left half and dropped very nice
3663827 its so easy to recoup the initial outlay of the book even in one day

3663830 the savings are extensive and given that sales of the book also supports action cancer its a win win initiative for everyone

3663845 the first thing is that the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process between india and pakistan
3663846 i think this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3663847 sheikh azizs death is big loss to the kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end

3663850 there will not be any proper clearance of the rain across northern ireland

3663854 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3663855 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3663856 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3663857 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3663858 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3663859 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3663860 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3663861 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3663862 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3663870 we still expect oil prices to decline over the course of 2009
3663871 the high level of oil prices should induce demand side adjustments

3663885 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3663886 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3663887 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3663888 i was exposed to his work but he never encouraged me to be part of his studio

3663898 das gesellschaftliche verhalten die amerikaner sind erst mal sehr direkt im kontakt sehr freundlich aber dann steht man vor einer riesigen chinesischen mauer vor dem eigentlichen ich da kommen sie lange nicht durch oder dar ber hinweg
3663899 theoretisch wusste ich das ja alles auch vorher schon aber es ist noch mal was anderes wenn sie mitbekommen dass leute nicht zum arzt gehen k nnen obwohl sie chronisch krank sind weil sie ihr monatliches budget berschritten haben und dann tagelang mit rasenden kopfschmerzen abgedunkelt zu hause liegen und man dann selbst anf ngt sich um sie zu k mmern es ging vielen menschen um einen herum richtig schlecht und das l sst mich nicht unber hrt in deutschland wird bisweilen vergessen was ein entwickelter sozialstaat wirklich bedeutet

3663916 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3663917 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3663918 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3663919 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3663920 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3663921 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3663922 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3663923 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3663924 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3663925 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore

3663934 i believe in backing success and i also have the view that governments are not the repositories of all wisdom
3663935 that means that when you get great community sector work like this as clontarf has done now over many many years id much rather back success when i see it than re invent the wheel

3663941 over recent weeks the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen considerably this rates often used as an indicator of banks marginal cost of funds particularly at the short end
3663942 looking over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rates down around half a per cent so thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3663943 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3663944 what id say to the commercial banks is this if youre registering in these economic circumstances a seven per cent increase in profit and im all for our companies being profitable its a part and parcel of the market economy
3663945 but if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families where working australians are under financial pressure at the moment that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3663946 over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bank bill rate is down around half a per cent so that significantly reduces the banks marginal cost of funding
3663947 i think that means that there is no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3663948 over time we would expect that the margin on home loans will revert to a level which was consistent to where it was say 12 13 months ago
3663949 if youre a bank generating significant profits and commercial banks have been generating significant profits in recent years i would say that those banks owe it to working families that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers
3663950 additional interest rate rises on top of the reserve bank have been proven to be more about profit gouging than about a serious downturn in the banking sector

3663954 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3663955 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3663956 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3663957 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3663958 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3663959 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3663960 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3663961 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3663962 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3663963 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3663964 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens

3663970 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought
3663971 with rpi inflation reaching 5 in july an acceleration in pay growth cannot be ruled out and even if it stays subdued the mpc has plenty of other inflation concerns which are likely to keep rates on hold for another couple of months at least

3663973 in my experience which now goes back over about 25 years of workplace relations i havent seen a matter like this when weve had 30 workers effectively without work to do coming to work and doing crossword puzzles and watching television
3663974 and the only explanation for that seems to be that the company thought it was too expensive to give them redundancy payments
3663975 we need to consider the judgment which is fairly detailed we have to consider our position

3663981 the sight of russian tanks rolling into parts of a sovereign country on its neighbouring borders will have brought a chill down the spine of many people
3663982 that is simply not the way in which international relations can be run in the 21st century
3663983 weve got to make sure that the russians realise that they do have rights in the international system but they must be allied with responsibilities
3663984 and when responsibilities are not upheld there are political consequences for russia
3663985 its unprecedented since the g8 became the g8 in the 1990s for seven countries to come together without an eighth country but that has happened over the last few days and i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences

3664006 our uavs are in demand by the army navy and air force as well as special operations beyond our uavs we continue to see strong demand for our infrared technologies applied in surveillance and target detection missions on major u s army and marine corps ground vehicles assets helicopters and other aircraft navy ships and in night vision sighting devices that equip individual soldiers
3664007 there is a need for persistent and pervasive surveillance in extremely demanding asymmetric battle spaces and demand by our military customers for interoperability remote access and control as well as full networkability as a result there is an ever increasing demand for smaller more capable full spectrum multi function sensors and offensive information operations warfare weapons
3664008 the greatest demand continues to be the u s department of defense and the intelligence community more specifically the ever increasing requirement for smaller multi function systems that can operate autonomously in hostile environments yet still provide the data information the warfighter requires for mission accomplishment

3664035 per ora no ryanair non pu lasciarli a terra a meno che non scelga arbitrariamente di non accettare le loro prenotazioni
3664036 no li compriamo regolarmente tramite il sito e a questo aggiungiamo le spese amministrative in percentuale variabile rispetto al costo del biglietto che rappresentano il nostro margine di guadagno
3664037 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3664038 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3664039 other channels for virus introduction including international trade or illegal and unreported movement of poultry

3664048 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3664049 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3664050 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3664051 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3664052 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3664053 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3664054 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3664055 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3664056 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3664057 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3664058 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3664059 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3664060 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3664061 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3664062 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3664063 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3664064 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3664065 the reason they are endangered is their habitat has declined which is primarily long leaf pine ecosystem which we have a lot of still in north carolina in the sandhills region
3664066 being careful with practices that might deter water quality like fertilizing yards and dumping oil in the sewer drains that kind of thing
3664067 ja schat ik doe onze boodschappen morgen tussen de besprekingen door want we moeten op tijd verschijnen op de receptie vanavond
3664068 nee zaterdag gaat niet lukken want ik heb overdag een hockeytoernooi en s avonds een barbecue en een verjaardag
3664069 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3664070 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3664071 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3664072 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3664073 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3664074 i dont collect miniatures and dont want to start now
3664075 i enjoy third edition and see no need to change
3664076 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3664077 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3664078 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3664079 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3664080 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3664081 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3664082 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3664083 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3664084 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3664085 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3664086 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3664087 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3664088 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3664089 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3664090 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3664091 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3664092 dialog oriented and line oriented interaction between the cmdlet and the user such as writing to prompting for and reading from user input
3664093 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3664094 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3664095 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3664096 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3664097 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3664098 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3664099 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3664100 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3664101 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3664102 we have already completed installation of machinery for the first phase we want to derive more benefits from the abundant fresh fruits in the area
3664103 the people of masaka have remained poor due to lack of a proper market for their produce which they sell in raw form
3664104 why would we want to do that unless we were going to legalise drugs
3664105 the drug war cannot stand the light of day it will collapse as quickly as the vietnam war as soon as people find out whats really going on
3664106 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3664107 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3664108 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3664109 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3664110 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3664111 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3664112 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3664113 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3664114 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3664115 in addition to commodity xl having the product functionality that could run our business we wanted a supplier that we could trust and depend on for a successful long term relationship
3664116 in short order triple point became the clear choice from both a technology and team standpoint
3664117 commodity xl is unique because it covers all the key elements of commodity management trading physical operations and risk including governance and compliance market operational and credit
3664118 in addition to commodity xl having the product functionality that could run our business we wanted a supplier that we could trust and depend on for a successful long term relationship
3664119 in short order triple point became the clear choice from both a technology and team standpoint
3664120 commodity xl is unique because it covers all the key elements of commodity management trading physical operations and risk including governance and compliance market operational and credit
3664121 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
3664122 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3664123 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3664124 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3664125 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3664126 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3664127 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3664128 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3664129 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3664130 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3664131 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3664132 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3664133 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3664134 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3664135 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3664136 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3664137 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3664138 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3664139 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3664140 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3664141 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3664142 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3664143 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3664144 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3664145 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3664146 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3664147 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3664148 ocho espa oles fueron evacuados de bao yen en dos helic pteros uno propiedad del gobierno vietnamita y en otro aparato privado
3664149 la mayor a lo hace en la peor poca que coincide con el verano espa ol pero con la estaci n lluviosa en sudeste de asia
3664150 it would suit the contractors to bang on about how tough times are at the moment and then try and screw us down on pay stretched over a three year deal
3664151 but wed be daft to accept that wed much rather have a one year or 18 month deal so we can look again then at how the industry is going
3664152 our members wouldnt be happy if we were tied into a low increase deal and all of a sudden the industry took off again
3664153 what was an easy funding solution turned into a more difficult one as the banks took a more cautious approach to lending
3664154 gb building solutions had chosen its subcontractors and we were about to put pen to paper to start work in september however we are still very keen to carry out this scheme as it is an integral part of our plans for doncaster racecourse we are now looking at finding alternative funding arrangements
3664155 we are naturally disappointed that arena leisure is not proceeding with the hotel and residential development at doncaster race course at this time but understand the decision in light of the current economic climate
3664156 it appears that swimming is benefiting from a number of interesting stories this year including michael phelps race for gold dara torres return to the games and park win to bring home south koreas first ever gold medal in swimming
3664157 as other events build momentum and the track and field competition begins it will be interesting to follow the fan favorites online
3664158 this camp was run by hizb e islami and there were about 15 people including foreigners there at the time of the attack
3664159 they arent even letting residents who live nearby go there but our information is that they have recovered nine bodies
3664160 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
3664161 i think its a step forward that we were able to reach an agreement on fully investigating the issue again
3664162 if the agreement is not acted upon then everything will break down if that happens we will also take necessary measures
3664163 i would like for them to be cautious and make sure they wont fall into north koreas trap
3664164 technology has changed so dramatically that we can change how we actually operate
3664165 a lot of what we were doing is if you will an old fashioned approach to newsgathering
3664166 what makes the difference is how were able to get out spread those journalists to more places and how quickly we can bring back original reporting to our viewers
3664167 to instruct forces to urgently overcome the consequences helping people stabilize life and keep updating damages
3664168 er ist dort hinein mit einer hand in einem sackerl
3664169 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3664170 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3664171 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3664172 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3664173 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3664174 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3664175 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3664176 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3664177 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3664178 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3664179 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3664180 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3664181 le gouvernement chinois nie les probl mes du tibet et n coute pas les demandes du peuple tib tain
3664182 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3664183 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3664184 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3664185 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3664186 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3664187 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3664188 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3664189 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3664190 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3664191 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3664192 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3664193 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3664194 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3664195 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3664196 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3664197 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3664198 bah there is nothing here if i only were to move to so so place id be truly happy
3664199 radware has demonstrated to the staff of tmc labs that sip director is indeed truly innovative in the ip communications industry sip director has made contributions which have resulted in significant advancement to the industry

3664204 my congratulations to radware for earning this award i look forward to seeing more innovative solutions from them as they continue to contribute to the future of ip communications
3664205 it was a colossal failure because the justice system was never permitted to fulfill its function
3664206 it was nothing less than a betrayal of the rule of law
3664207 no idea no idea no clue i have no idea all the way through
3664208 the prospect of all of those witnesses having that kind of a response is thoroughly untenable
3664209 it was far easier than it should have been for this part of the investigation to become a casualty of winnipeg police officers some of whom gave higher regard to their loyalty to each other and to self preservation than to their solemn oaths to uphold the law
3664210 the outstanding issue is whether he did this because he didnt want to be involved in ruining derek harvey zenk or whether he was actually trying to protect him
3664211 were asking posts to ensure complete separation between unclassified paragraphs which seek to portray the situation according to public observers and publicly available sources and classified paragraphs which contain sensitive information or judgments or provide advice about future canadian policy
3664212 theres an undue focus on how to keep the governments most meaningful insights and analysis about foreign countries human rights records out of the public domain
3664213 human rights should not be considered as a matter of grave secrecy and confidentiality
3664214 extra judicial executions disappearances torture and detention without trial are all too common
3664215 its pretty clear that one of the main driving forces behind this approach is the aftermath of the debacle around the afghan report
3664216 according to the ngo community international organizations or generally informed but not privileged contacts
3664217 the classified summary paragraphs should contain firm and sharp judgments based on privileged and sensitive information
3664218 people are most upset and very disappointed by the results
3664219 it was not just the residents it was also people like a cab driver who talked about the pleasure he gets in bringing people from out of town through shaughnessy heights because of the estate like quality of the neighbourhood
3664220 the overwhelming sentiment was you dont change the character and planning of a neighbourhood to accommodate a development
3664221 the site were proposing to build on is the site they dump the snow on and drainage culverts have been crushed there because of road construction
3664222 we want to improve all the culverts so you can get an improved environment
3664223 all we are is the owners of the land bc transit would lease the land and would be responsible for addressing environmental concerns while the land is used by them
3664224 that site doesnt look like your typical gorgeous wetland but i find it disgusting that they are planning this
3664225 it doesnt matter what they are putting on there whether it is environmentally friendly or not
3664226 risk assessments would be more focused on the likelihood of harming others and definitely if somebody is suicidal depressed has a history of breaching court orders has a history of violence such a risk assessment would come back that he would be at high risk to offend then the court would be entitled to detain him
3664227 if we have a concern about a person being suicidal within the custody centre if they were being released we would notify police basically because there is authority under the mental health act to apprehend somebody transport them to hospital and then theyre assessed medically
3664228 it wouldnt be common that somebody would be in that state on release
3664229 what turns you on more my pretty face or my sexy body
3664230 what turns you on more my pretty face or my sexy body
3664231 what turns you on more my pretty face or my sexy body
3664232 thats why were doing this project i was hoping to get this done before things like this happened again
3664233 to point fingers at anybody at this point we just dont know
3664234 we have a significant robust safety system in place today
3664235 its absolutely insane and woefully inadequate if youve set yourself up as the public safety watchdog for that industry sector
3664236 i think what this has shown us is the approved regulator may well be asleep at the switch
3664237 we need to understand what caused the explosion to understand how we can best move to protect the residents of toronto
3664238 there has been some debate about the terms the lads wanted to stay on the t5 agreement but that wont be the case so they wont be getting the extra 4 50 an hour paid during the main construction phase
3664239 the lads will be doing finishing work its not a question of carrying out maintenance its a huge job so there were always going to be a few things to sort out even after the opening
3664240 the spie matthew hall team will be carrying out the standard post opening work associated with a project of this size and complexity
3664241 have we forgotten why most of these guys came into the industry because they are good with their hands and not with the pen
3664242 the evolution of the fighter part 6 d amp d 4e

3664246 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3664247 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3664248 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3664249 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3664250 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3664251 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3664252 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3664253 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3664254 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3664255 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3664256 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3664257 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3664258 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3664259 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3664260 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3664261 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3664262 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3664263 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3664264 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3664265 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3664266 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3664267 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3664268 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3664269 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3664270 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3664271 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3664272 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3664273 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3664274 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3664275 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3664276 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3664277 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3664278 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3664279 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3664280 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3664281 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3664282 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3664283 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3664284 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3664285 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3664286 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3664287 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3664288 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3664289 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3664290 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3664291 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3664292 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3664293 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3664294 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3664295 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3664296 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3664297 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3664298 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3664299 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3664300 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3664301 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3664302 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3664303 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3664304 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3664305 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3664306 we are thrilled to have mr xiao and ms li move into these senior roles on our management team
3664307 previously serving as our vice president of sales mr xiao brings over fifteen years of rich sales and management experience to his new role mr xiao will focus on developing and improving the processes that allow noah to deliver our leading products and services
3664308 ms li has proven to be an invaluable addition to noahs senior management li will continue to bring great value to our company ensuring first class financial management and effective fiscal control the appointments of xiao and li recognize their comprehensive experience and mark our progress as a public company
3664309 what turns you on more my pretty face or my sexy body
3664310 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3664311 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3664312 es wird schwer aber ich glaube daran wir gewinnen wieder die wm
3664313 what you have to do and the way you have to do it is incredibly simple whether you are willing to do it thats another matter
3664314 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3664315 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3664316 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3664317 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3664318 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3664319 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3664320 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3664321 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3664322 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3664323 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3664324 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3664325 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3664326 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3664327 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3664328 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3664329 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3664330 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3664331 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3664332 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3664333 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3664334 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3664335 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3664336 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3664337 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3664338 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3664339 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3664340 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3664341 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3664342 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3664343 you had six years and all you came up with is this
3664344 why dont mulder and scully mention the looming alien invasion set for 2012

3664349 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3664350 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3664351 if muslims can kill each other during ramadan they can appear before the grand jury all they cant do is eat before sunset i believe mr request is part of the attempted islamization of the american justice system
3664352 in this particular arab islamic culture she would not be able to stop him from leaving
3664353 call him a racist in signs if you see him
3664354 call him an injustice call him whatever you want to call him but in his face all the time
3664355 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3664356 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3664357 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3664358 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3664359 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3664360 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3664361 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3664362 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3664363 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3664364 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3664365 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3664366 research by the school of psychology at the university of plymouth in 2003 demonstrated that goldfish have a memory span of at least three months and can distinguish between different shapes colors and sounds they were trained to push a lever to earn a food reward when the lever was fixed to work only for an hour a day the fish soon learned to activate it at the correct time the mythbusters tested the myth that goldfish only had a memory span of 3 seconds the mythbusters were also able to prove that goldfish had a longer memory span than commonly believed this was done by making goldfish go through a maze over a period of time it was evident that they were able to remember the way and that they therefore had a memory span of over three seconds

3664371 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3664372 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

3664380 he has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault which has caused very significant bruising to the forearm
3664381 we are getting anyone who has not received their solutions to call their congressman and senators to get their friends family and neighbors to call the ceos of banks we are giving them all their addresses and phone numbers
3664382 the only problem is ceos have a lot of property and there are a lot of doors to knock on but its personal and were going to make it personal
3664383 analysts pay close attention to the volumes and trend of nonperforming loans and thats a key performance indicator that analysts zero in on
3664384 the growth in nonperforming loans up to now has been a significant concern and the alleviation of this concern would be de facto positive
3664385 our experience has been reasonably good in that 50 of these modified loans remain current with their modified terms after about six months
3664386 once a borrower gets into trouble its very hard to get out of it
3664387 the new stuff thats coming on is just overwhelming and theres so much noise out there for this to make an impact
3664388 its pretty significant in finding out where the bodies lie and what skeletons lie in the closet

3664398 today the focus for lenders is not so much on consumer loans being repaid but on the loan as a perpetual earning asset

3664408 surely god was in this place and i i did not know
3664409 if i had known that god would have been here i wouldnt have gone to sleep in such a holy place
3664410 if god was here and i didnt know then perhaps god has been other places also
3664411 come up to me on the mountain and be there
3664412 ma avendo e stando pagando anticipatamente i servizi al nostro fornitore per noi era necessario ottenere il pagamento in tempi brevi
3664413 i believed i was a young untouchable great singer who could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted
3664414 i had an image of myself and when things change or life moves on thats when people struggle
3664415 for me that happened at quite a young age i had to make major decisions in my life that upset the image i had of myself i had to accept i had to lose the image of myself
3664416 just little things like that change your perspective of who you are
3664417 touring america changed me a lot i became greedy it was all about wants and needs and thats not me as a human being thats not the kind of person i am and i didnt like the person id become
3664418 i was putting myself under a lot of pressure and allowing past failures and things like that to control the moment instead of just expressing myself like i used to be able to id lost that especially as a performer i was half the singer i used to be
3664419 do you know that fella gollum from lord of the rings it was a really mild version of that
3664420 i kept thinking hang on a sec ive should have a good life here why am i feeling this way im in what i believe to be one of the best bands in the country and im sat panicking about random stuff distorted thoughts suicide became an option i became a very unhappy young man but even suicide is the act of an ego thats the final act of an ego to protect oneself from being wrong
3664421 when your bodys physically shaking and you cant keep still and youre sweating and youre sat watching your tv and your hearts like a machine gun thats when i got to the point where i was thinking theres something not right here
3664422 which is what i needed to hear so i checked in and got myself sorted for a few weeks
3664423 after that its just been constant care and attention ive been sober for two and a half years now staying fit eating well seeing a regular therapist whenever i can whenever ive got things to talk about
3664424 stay present as opposed to living in the past or the future
3664425 you just need to look down the song titles to know that
3664426 strength in numbers the spike refers to addiction wants and needs and the grey areas in between
3664427 ive tried illegal drugs and legal drugs and theyre both shit all it does is stops us from discovering who we are i dont know why people are so afraid of reality so there was a mild fascination with addiction and what drives people songs called the left side and get through it are obvious ones that was like therapy writing those lyrics
3664428 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring
3664429 they made a big mistake if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here pointing to her head
3664430 when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

3664434 the conditions for free and fair elections start long before election day
3664435 less than a month before elections its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
3664436 failing to fully ensure the right to free elections and other rights critical to a fair poll including the freedoms of expression and of assembly
3664437 major areas of concern include the governments obligations to safeguard freedom of assembly and expression and access to the media by all stakeholders and to establish an impartial national electoral body
3664438 the government has also failed to provide adequate security to political parties participating in elections and to ensure political tolerance and full participation of citizens

3664455 no not a real dog it means take a situation thats not what you want and bring it to you sooner try to turn it into something exciting and positive and unexpected
3664456 what exactly do you do with something thats not what you want
3664457 well thats the problem isnt it it depends on the person or the business
3664458 it seems inevitable that extended very weak economic activity and deteriorating business confidence will exact an increasing toll on the labour market over the coming months
3664459 it is only a matter of time before the resulting weakness in firms revenues results in more widespread job cuts

3664462 does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does
3664463 are you from galilee too search and you will see that no prophet is to rise ftom galilee
3664464 i am the light of the world he who follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life
3664465 you are bearing witness to yourself your testimony is not true
3664466 even if i do bear witness to myself my testimony is true for i know whence i have come and whither i am going but you do not know whence i come or whither i am going
3664467 maka janganlah mayatnya dibiarkan semalam malaman pada tiang itu tetapi haruslah engkau menguburkan dia pada hari itu juga sebab seorang yang digantung terkutuk oleh allah janganlah engkau menajiskan tanah yang diberikan tuhan allahmu kepadamu menjadi milik pusakamu
3664468 ia sangat ketakutan dan makin bersungguh sungguh berdoa peluhnya menjadi seperti titik titik darah yang bertetesan ke tanah
3664469 doa orang yang benar bila dengan yakin didoakan sangat besar kuasanya
3664470 dalam hidupnya sebagai manusia ia telah mempersembahkan doa dan permohonan dengan ratap tangis dan keluhan kepada dia yang sanggup menyelamatkannya dari maut dan karena kesalehannya ia telah didengarkan
3664471 maka seorang malaikat dari langit menampakkan diri kepadanya untuk memberi kekuatan kepadanya
3664472 air tersebut disebabkan oleh adanya gangguan syaraf pada pembuluh darah lokal akibat rangsangan yang berlebihan dari proses penyaliban
3664473 dan sekitar jam dua belas siang jam 6 waktu lbrani pilatus berkata kepada orang yahudi itu
3664474 jam enam dan jam sembilan terjadi guruh gerhana matahari dan gempa bumi
3664475 pilatus heran waktu mendengar bahwa yesus sudah mati maka ia memanggil kepala pasukan dan bertanya kepadanya apakah yesus sudah mati
3664476 mereka tahu bahwa orang yahudi pasti akan membunuh yesus lagi
3664477 keesokan harinya datanglah imam imam kepala dan orang orang farisi bersama sama menghadap pilatus dan mereka berkata tuan kami ingat bahwa si penyesat sewaktu hidupnya berkata karena itu perintahkanlah untuk menjaga kubur itu sampai hari yang ketiga jikalau tidak penyesatan yang terakhir akan lebih buruk akibatnya daripada yang pertama
3664478 ini penjaga penjaga bagimu pergi dan jagalah kubur itu sebaik baiknya
3664479 orang orang kafir itu membuat tipu daya dan allah membalas tipu daya mereka itu dan allah sebaik baiknya pembalas tipu daya
3664480 mengapa yesus menanyakan pertanyaan yang kedengarannya bodoh bukankah yesus pasti tahu alasannya tentu saja dia tahu lalu mengapa yesus mengajukan pertanyaan bodoh
3664481 maria menyangka orang itu adalah penunggu taman lalu berkata kepadanya
3664482 dan sama seperti manusia ditetapkan untuk mati hanya satu kali saja dan sesudah itu dihakimi
3664483 tuan jikalau tuan yang mengambil dia katakanlah kepadaku dimana tuan meletakkan dia
3664484 tetapi ketika mereka mendengar bahwa yesus hidup dan telah dilihat olehnya mereka tidak percaya
3664485 maka datanglah yudas juga ke situ dengan sekelompok orang dan penjaga penjaga rumah allah yang disuruh oleh imam imam kepala dan orang orang farisi lengkap dengan lentera suluh dan senjata
3664486 masukkan pedang itu kembali ke dalam sarungnya sebab barang siapa yang menggunakan pedang akan binasa oleh pedang
3664487 janganlah kamu menyangka bahwa aku datang untuk membawa damai di atas bumi aku datang bukan untuk membawa damai melainkan pedang
3664488 aku datang untuk melemparkan api ke bumi dan betapakah aku harapkan api itu telah menyala kamu menyangka bahwa aku datang untuk membawa damai di atas bumi bukan kataku kepadamu bukan damai melainkan pertentangan
3664489 mereka menumpas dengan mata pedang segala sesuatu yang ada di dalam kota itu baik laki laki maupun perempuan baik tua maupun muda bahkan lembu domba dan keledai
3664490 guru kami siap mati demi engkau kami siap dipenjara demi engkau
3664491 murid murid yesus selalu salah mengerti terhadap dirinya dan kerjanya menginginkan dia untuk mengumumkan diri sebagai raja yahudi menginginkan dia untuk memanggil api dari surga menginginkan duduk di sebelah kanan atau di sebelah kirinya di kerajaannya menginginkan dia menunjuk mereka pada bapanya untuk membuat tuhan dapat dilihat secara fisik oleh mata menginginkan dia melakukan sesuatu bagi dirinya dan diri mereka yaitu segala sesuatu yang tidak sesuai dengan rencana besarnya ini adalah gambaran bagaimana mereka memperlakukan dia sampai dengan akhir dan ketika saat akhir datang mereka meninggalkannya dan lari
3664492 bahwa lebih berguna bagimu jika satu orang mati untuk bangsa kita daripada seluruh bangsa kita ini binasa
3664493 aku berbicara terus terang kepada dunia aku selalu mengajar di rumah rumah ibadat dan di bait allah tempat semua orang yahudi berkumpul aku tidak pernah berbicara sembunyi sembunyi
3664494 dalam hal ini pun kesaksian mereka tidak sesuai satu dengan lainnya
3664495 jikalau kataku itu salah tunjukkanlah salahnya tetapi jikalau kataku itu benar mengapakah engkau menampar aku
3664496 untuk apa kita perlu saksi lagi lalu dengan suara bulat mereka memutuskan bahwa dia harus dihukum mati injil markus 14 63 64
3664497 telah kedapatan oleh kami bahwa orang ini menyesatkan bangsa kami dan melarang membayar pajak kepada kaisar dan tentang dirinya ia mengatakan bahwa ia adalah kristus ialah raja
3664498 berikanlah kepada kaisar apa yang wajib kamu berikan kepadanya dan kepada allah apa yang wajib kamu berikan kepada allah
3664499 ke pembantaian seperti anak domba dia dianiaya tetapi dia membiarkan dirinya ditindas sehingga tidak membuka mulutnya
3664500 apakah yesus berbicara dengan mulut tertutup bagaimana ungkapan ungkapan berikut yang diatributkam kepada yesus keluar dari bibir yesus tanpa membuka mulutnya
3664501 jikalau kataku itu salah tunjukkan salahnya tetapi jikalau kataku itu benar mengapakan engkau menampar aku
3664502 ya bapaku jikalau sekiranya mungkin biarlah cawan ini lalu dari padaku
3664503 sekalipun melihat mereka tidak melihat dan sekalipun mendengar mereka tidak mendengar dan tidak mengerti
3664504 jikalau engkau membebaskan dia engkau bukanlah sahabat kaisar setiap orang yang menganggap dirinya sebagai raja ia bukanlah sahabat kaisar
3664505 jangan engkau mencampuri perkara orang yang benar itu sebab karena dia aku sangat menderita dalam mimpi tadi malam

3664510 the fire itself is not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3664511 women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever
3664512 its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol
3664513 its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry

3664519 we have made the decision to stop producing a local newscast in the mornings on the weekend the audience available weekend mornings is very modest eliminating those telecasts enables us to direct more reporting resources to our weekend evening and monday through friday programs as well as increasing the resources we have to provide on the internet in a 24 7 news day
3664520 ive thought lisa was the hottest woman on televised news since as far back as i can remember
3664521 that first shot they show of lisa patton in the weather newscast when shes still sitting at the desk with her sparkly green eyes no matter what the thermometer says its hot in my household
3664522 ketika aku mengutus kamu dengan tiada membawa pundi pundi bekal dan kasut adakah kamu kekurangan apa apa
3664523 lihat aku mengutus kamu seperti domba ke tengah tengah serigala sebab itu hendaklah kamu cerdik seperti ular dan tulus seperti merpati
3664524 tetapi seorang dari mereka yang menyertai yesus mengulurkan tangannya menghunuskan pedangnya dan meletakkannya kepada hamba imam besar sehingga putus telinganya
3664525 duduklah di sini sementara aku pergi ke sana untuk berdoa
3664526 dan ia membawa petrus dan kedua anak zebedeus bersamanya lalu katanya kepada mereka tinggallah di sini dan berjaga jagalah dengan aku
3664527 ia sangat ketakutan dan makin bersungguh sungguh berdoa peluhnya menjadi seperti titik titik darah yang bertetesan ke tanah
3664528 maka jika matamu yang kanan menyesatkan engkau cukillah dan buanglah itu dan jika tanganmu yang kanan menyesatkan engkau maka penggallah dan buanglah itu karena lebih baik bagimu jika satu dari anggota tubuhmu binasa daripada tubuhmu yang utuh masuk neraka
3664529 tak satu pun suku kafir yang pernah menyusun cerita yang sangat aneh yang penuh dengan dugaan bahwa manusia lahir dengan dosa bawaan dari nenek moyangnya dan dosa bawaan itu yang sebetulnya bukanlah tanggungjawabnya secara pribadi harus ditebus dan bahwa sang pencipta alam beserta isinya ini telah mengorbankan satu satunya putranya untuk menebus kutukan misterius ini
3664530 lalu ia pergi lagi dan mengucapkan doa yang itu juga
3664531 mereka tidak tahu jawab apa yang harus mereka berikan kepada yesus
3664532 lalu ia bangkit dari doanya dan kembali kepada murid muridnya tetapi ia mendapati mereka sedang tidur karena dukacita
3664533 tetapi andaikata kristus tidak dibangkitkan maka sia sialah pemberitaan kami dan sia sialah kepercayaanmu
3664534 kematian yesus di kayu salib adalah pusat dari semua ajaran agama kristen semua ajaran kristen tentang tuhan tentang makhluk tentang dosa dan kematian mempunyai point yang vokal dalam kebangkitan yesus semua ajaran kristen tentang sejarah tentang masa depan tentang gereja keyakinan dan kepercayaan semuanya berasal dari kebangkitan kembali yesus
3664535 dan karena ucapan mereka sesungguhnya kaml telah membunuh al masih isa putra maryam rasul allah padahal mereka tidak membunuhnya dan tidak pula menyalibnya tetapi orang yang mereka bunuh adalah orang yang diserupakan dengan isa bagi mereka sesungguhnya orang orang yang berselisih paham tentang pembunuhan isa benar benar dalam keraguan tentang yang dibunuh itu kecuali mengikuti persangkaan belaka mereka tidak pula yakin bahwa yang mereka bunuh itu adalah isa
3664536 mereka orang kristen telah dilatih untuk membenci muhammad dan segala ajarannya
3664537 kebangkitan kristus dari nazaret bisa merupakan kenyataan sejarah yang sangat hebat dan bisa juga suatu penipuan yang sangat licik kepada pengikut pengikut kristen
3664538 saya terpaksa menyimpulkan bahwa kebangkitan kristus bisa merupakan suatu kejadian yang paling jahat tidak masuk akal dan menipu pikiran umat kristiani tetapi bisa berarti juga suatu kenyataan sejarah yang sangat mengagumkan
3664539 bagaimana mungkin seorang laki laki muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam yang tinggal ribuan mil jauhnya dari tempat kejadian dan hidup pada masa 600 tahun setelah kejadian mengetahui apa yang terjadi sebenarnya
3664540 ya itu benar tetapi kami mempunyai kesaksian mereka yang dibuat di bawah sumpah mereka
3664541 katakanlah tunjukkanlah bukti kebenaranmu jika kamu adalah orang yang benar
3664542 apakah semua all di sini berarti semua all dalam bahasa anda
3664543 hujan badai gerhana matahari gempa bumi batu terbelah kuburan kuburan terbuka dan mayat mayat yang terbaring bangkit dan berkumpul di jalan menuju ke yerusalem
3664544 mereka tidak pula yakin bahwa yang mereka bunuh itu adalah isa
3664545 katakanlah kepada puteri sion lihat rajamu datang kepadamu mengendarai seekor keledai
3664546 hosana bagi anak daud hosana di tempat yang maha tinggi
3664547 karena ia sudah dekat dengan yerusalem dan mereka menyangka bahwa kerajaan allah akan segera kelihatan
3664548 akan tetapi semua seteruku ini yang tidak suka aku menjadi rajanya bawalah mereka kemari dan bunuhlah mereka di depan mataku
3664549 hosana diberkatilah dia yang datang dalam nama tuhan raja israel
3664550 maka kata orang orang farisi lihatlah seluruh dunia datang mengikuti dia yesus
3664551 sekarang berlangsung penghakiman atas dunia ini sekarang juga penguasa dunia ini akan dilemparkan keluar
3664552 lebih berguna bagimu jika satu orang mati untuk bangsa kita daripada seluruh bangsa kita ini binasa
3664553 waktunya telah tiba dan sekarang pangeran dunia akan diusir saya harus menguasai mereka membawa mereka dan membunuh mereka sebelum mereka membunuh saya
3664554 semua tulisan adalah didapatkan berdasarkan ilham dari tuhan dan bermanfaat bagi pengajaran hukuman perbaikan perintah menuju kebenaran
3664555 segala tulisan yang diilhamkan memang bermanfaat untuk mengajar untuk menyatakan kesalahan untuk memperbaiki kelakuan dan untuk mendidik orang dalam kebe naran
3664556 segala tulisan yang diilhamkan dari tuhan adalah bermanfaat untuk mengajar menegur membenarkan
3664557 dia membiarkan maninya terbuang tetapi yang dilakukannya ita adalah jahat di mata tuhan maka tuhan membunuh dia juga
3664558 apakah pelajaran moral yang bisa didapatkan oleh anak anak kita dari pembalasan dendam tamar ini
3664559 buku yang paling berbahaya di dunia jagalah agar tetap tertutup rapat dan terkunci
3664560 membacakan cerita cerita dari injil kepada anak anak bisa membuka kesempatan untuk mendiskusikan moral seks suatu kitab injil yang belum dibersihkan pasti mendapat rating x dari badan sensor
3664561 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
3664562 mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals so ill abuse my power to steal his property and shut him down
3664563 anak haram tidak boleh masuk jamaah tuhan bahkan sampai keturunannya yang kesepuluh ulangan 23 2
3664564 tuhan sangat kasih pada orang orang yang berdosa sehingga dia tidak keberatan memberikan leluhur seperti itu pada anak nya
3664565 jika tidak pada kedatangan pertama lalu pada kedatangannya yang kedua dia akan memenuhi ramalan ini
3664566 ada anggapan yang bertentangan bahwa para teolog belum bisa memenuhi kepuasan pada para atheis masih ada kesulitan tekstual yang dihadapi oleh para peneliti injil hanya orang yang buta injil yang menyangkal kenyataan ini dan masalah masalah lainnya
3664567 setelah aku menyelidiki segala peristiwa itu dengan seksama dari asal mulanya aku mengambil keputusan untuk membukukannya dengan teratur bagimu
3664568 dalam segala pengakuannya lukas dengan teliti membandingkan dan mengedit bahan bahan tulisannya tetapi kelihatannya dia mempunyai kecenderungan untuk menambahkan bahan bahan yang berhubungan dengan tuhan dan kita bisa menebak secara masuk akal pada sumber sumber tulisan yang dibuatnya
3664569 maka kecelakaan yang besarlah bagi orang orang yang menulis al kitab dengan tangan mereka sendiri lalu dikatakannya ini dari allah dengan rnaksud untuk memperoleh keuntungan yang sedikit dengan perbuatan itu maka kecelakaan besarlah bagi mereka akibat dari apa yang ditulis oleh tangan mereka sendiri dan kecelakaan besarlah bagi mereka akibat dari apa yang mereka kerjakan
3664570 al qur an the miracle of miracles keajaiban di atas keajaiban
3664571 dalam bab ini diasumsikan bahwa pertanyaan terhadap keaslian dan kemurnian kitab suci kita telah timbul di kalangan umat muhammad
3664572 bagaimana mungkin selama 2000 tahun orang orang kristen di seluruh dunia tidak tahu perhitungan religius untuk mendapatkan kesimpulan yang benar
3664573 jika setan telah sukses dalam mengelabui orang kristen dan membiarkan mereka tetap tertipu selama 2000 tahun terhadap keyakinan yang sederhana ini tidakkah mudah juga bagi setan untuk membuat mereka salah dalam segala hal yang menyangkut tuhan
3664574 apakah cerita penyaliban ini bukannya cerita bohong terbesar sepanjang sejarah bisakah kita sekarang menyebutnya sebagai kisah fiksi
3664575 thomas yang meragukan dia tidak bersama mereka murid murid yesus ketika yesus datang
3664576 ibunya terbaring di tumpukan pupuk di tempat mandi sapi sapi dipukuli oleh ayahku
3664577 delapan hari kemudian murid murid yesus berada kembali dalam rumah itu dan thomas bersama sama dengan mereka kemudian yesus datang
3664578 deedat akhir akhir ini telah membuat berita yang besar mengenai batu nisan dengan menerbitkan sebuah brosur dengan judul siapa yang memindahkan batu tersebut
3664579 25 buku ini telah dicetak cukup lama bahkan jika anda punya kopinya anda tidak akan mungkin bisa mengeceknya para pemuja ini sangat yakin sekali tetapi kitab injil yang benar adalah yang saya percayai
3664580 dia maria sangat heran saat menemukan bahwa batu tersebut telah dipindahkan
3664581 taruhlah jarimu di sini dan lihatlah tanganku ulurkanlah tanganmu dan cucukkan ke dalam lambungku dan jangan engkau tidak percaya lagi melainkan percayalah
3664582 jika kata menyalib hanya berarti membunuh di atas kayu salib kita kehilangan kata kerja lain untuk meng gambarkan kegiatan memancang di atas kayu memalukan sekali
3664583 jika kata menyalib hanya berarti membunuh maka apa arti lain dari menyalib kamus oxford yang terkenal di seluruh dunia mendefinisikan menyalib sebagai membunuh dengan cara mengikat pada sebuah salib

3664586 i know this is against the grain as everyone has jumped on the reweighting story
3664587 all of us have to do our bit to bring inflation to within the target band in the medium term
3664588 the core inflation rate is still above the upper limit of the inflationtarget
3664589 even if inflation does come down an investec report stated it would come down if the new weightings were implemented it will be dropping from above target to above target then you still have second round effects
3664590 the questions needing to be asked include but not limited to the following how much time have you spent learning the dynamics of social media what are the top five things you have learned
3664591 i struggled until i took a chance mixed my operatic style with pop in purple rain and realised my dreams

3664593 what i saw is the security guards were very rude to the reporters they pushed them i heard orders being shouted by the officers just use your hands they said they said get to the reporters and cover their camera lenses as a chinese person i feel bad
3664594 they made tsigns and one of them asked me for my views on tibet i said i was a journalist and had no views on tibet
3664595 i did not at any time try to unfurl a banner and i have never possessed any banner or protest material i was there simply to report on a demonstration not to take part in it in any way
3664596 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3664597 waktu ia duduk makan dengan mereka ia mengambi1 roti mengucap berkat lalu memecah mecahkannya dan memberikannya kepada mereka
3664598 lalu kembalilah mereka dan memberitahukannya kepada teman teman yang lain tetapi kepada mereka pun teman teman itu tidak percaya
3664599 mengapa kamu mencari dia yang hidup di antara orang mati lukas 24 4 5
3664600 dia yesus menampakkan diri kepada kesebelas orang itu ketika mereka sedang makan
3664601 yesus menampakkan diri kepada kefas simon petrus dan kemudian kepada kedua belas muridnya
3664602 apakah tanda dari yunus yesus akan sangat setuju dengan kita
3664603 tidak kenyataannya adalah bahwa yesus langsung berdiri di tengah tengah mereka dia tidak masuk
3664604 untuk pertama kalinya dalam hidupku aku menyadari bagaimana manusiawinya yesus
3664605 kata yesus kepada mereka damai sejahtera bagi kamu tetapi mereka terkejut dan takut
3664606 mereka terkejut dan takut dan menyangka bahwa mereka melihat hantu
3664607 perkenankanlah kami duduk dalam kemulianmu kelak yang seorang lagi di sebelah kananmu dan yang seorang lagi di sebelah kirimu
3664608 lihat tangan dan kakiku aku sendirilah ini rabalah aku dan lihatlah karena hantu tidak ada daging dan tulangnya seperti yang kamu lihat ada padaku ia memperlihatkan tangan dan kakinya kepada mereka
3664609 hantu semua hantu tidak memiliki daging dan tulang seperti yang kamu lihat ada padaku
3664610 siapa yang mengatakan bahwa orang yang bangkit kembali akan menjadi hantu
3664611 dalam injil lukas 20 27 36 coba lihat bagian dimana yesus berkata hantu tidak mempunyai daging dan tulang dan anda akan melihatnya
3664612 rabi perempuan ini tertangkap basah ketika ia sedang berbuat zinah
3664613 hantu tidak mempunyai daging dan tulang seperti yang kamu lihat pada diriku
3664614 sambil berkata demikian ia memperlihatkan tangan dan kakinya kepada mereka
3664615 jika yesus makan hanya untuk menunjukkan bahwa dia bisa makan sementara sebenarnya dia tidak memerlukan makanan maka mungkin itu suatu kepura puraan sesuatu yang docetic
3664616 orang orang yahudi dan nasrani tidak akan senang kepadamu hingga kamu mengikuti agama mereka
3664617 shes got some colour back in her cheeks and is doing fine
3664618 guru dalam bahasa yahudi rabbi kami ingin melihat suatu tanda dari padamu
3664619 generasi yang jahat dan tidak setia ini menuntut suatu tanda mujizat tetapi kepada mereka tidak akan diberikan tanda mujizat selain tanda mujizat nabi yunus
3664620 angkatlah aku campakkanlah aku ke dalam laut maka laut akan menjadi reda dan tidak menyerang kamu lagi
3664621 seperti nabi yunus tiga hari dan tiga malam di dalam perut ikan paus demikian juga anak manusia
3664622 tidakkah bisa kalian lihat bahwa dia menekankan faktor waktu dia mengulang kata tiga empat kali
3664623 sebab seperti yunus tinggal di dalam perut ikan tiga hari tiga malam demikian juga anak manusia akan tinggal di dalam rahim bumi tiga hari tiga malam
3664624 in the second decade of the twentieth century it was almost impossible to build an airplane in the united states
3664625 the commons leads to overuse and destruction the anticommons leads to underuse and waste in the cultural sphere ever tighter restrictions on copyright and fair use limit artists abilities to sample and build on older works of art
3664626 in theory one should be able to break a gridlock by striking a deal that would leave all sides better off sometimes that happens just the other week for instance nokia and qualcomm settled a three year long patent battle which could accelerate the spread of third generation cell phone technology here and in europe in a less contentious fashion products like the dvd player quickly became mainstream and affordable because many companies worked together to form patent pools
3664627 recent experimental work by the psychologist sven vanneste and the legal scholar ben depoorter helps explain why when something you own is necessary to the success of a venture even if its contribution is small youll tend to ask for an amount close to the full value of the venture and since everyone in your position also thinks he deserves a huge sum the venture quickly becomes unviable so the next time we start handing out new ownership rights whether via patents or copyright or privatization better try to weigh all the good things that wont happen as a result otherwise we wont know what weve been missing
3664628 the partnership represents an incredible opportunity for ctv in that it significantly offsets our operational costs and so helps us to get the channel up and running
3664629 it is a mutually beneficial partnership that gives us access to facilities while afda students gain hands on experience in television production we commend afdas management on their vision and initiative in engaging with ctv in this manner it shows openness innovative thinking and generosity that we really appreciate
3664630 afda is always looking for opportunities to provide students with situational training and opportunities to exhibit and broadcast their work
3664631 the partnership with ctv will bring enormous benefits to afda in terms of situational training giving our students the opportunity to participate in the activities of a real tv station it is also a very privileged position to watch a tv station being established and to see how it develops over the years to come students can gain insight into how they too can develop things for themselves from small beginnings
3664632 the relationship reflects our commitment to working with training providers in cape town this positions ctv as an interface between the formal education institutions and the video industry by providing emerging film makers with a development ground at the same time the relationship wont affect ctvs independence and accountability to the cape town community and we will still engage with other training institutions
3664633 we are excited to be in afdas space where there is such a vibrant creative energy this signals the beginning of a long term relationship between ctv and afda

3664859 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3664860 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3664871 there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it
3664872 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club but from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
3664873 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club nor has my relationship with garry cook and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis
3664874 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club

3664877 i was held in a restaurant and physically and forcibly restrained there
3664878 i tried to explain to these people that i was a journalist but they dragged me out and slung me in in the back of a police van and held me there for another few minutes
3664879 nobody punched me but they were very forceful and i have a cut knee and a bruise on my finger
3664880 they basically dragged me into the restaurant and then out and took my shoes off me
3664881 i was able to eventually show them my journalist credentials and they realised i was a british journalist and the next time the door of the van opened i was able to walk out
3664882 they did ask me in english what my views were on tibet and i said i dont have any views im a journalist
3664883 i was there purely to report on a protest and took no part in the protest itself
3664884 we then contacted the british embassy and they are taking it up at consular level
3664885 we are aware of the incident and have spoken directly to john ray

3664950 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3664951 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3664952 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3664953 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3664954 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3664955 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3664956 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3664957 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3664958 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3664959 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3664960 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3664961 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3664962 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3664963 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3664964 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3664965 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3664966 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3664967 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3664968 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3664969 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3664970 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3664971 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3664972 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3664973 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3664974 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3664975 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3664976 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3664977 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3664978 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3664979 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3664980 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3664981 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3664982 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3664983 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3664984 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3664985 who are open to doing something on the production side
3664986 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3664987 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3664988 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3664989 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3664990 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3664991 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3664992 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3664993 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3664994 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3664995 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3664996 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3664997 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3664998 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3664999 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3665000 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3665001 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3665002 i first picked this up in bits and pieces last week off daily rotation a more in depth story is available at zdnet which reports a weeks worth of speculations around russian internet forums have finally materialized into the attacks have already managed to compromise several government web sites with continuing ddos attacks against numerous other georgian government sites prompting the government to switch to hosting locations to the us with georgias ministry of foreign affairs undertaking a desperate step in order to disseminate real time information by moving to a blogspot account there is a question whether the computer work is being done by the russian military or others zdnets story offers further analysis of the attacks themselves and their origins some pretty good reporting
3665003 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3665004 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3665005 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3665006 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3665007 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3665013 i believe in backing success and i also have the view that governments are not the repositories of all wisdom
3665014 that means that when you get great community sector work like this as clontarf has done now over many many years id much rather back success when i see it than re invent the wheel
3665015 there has been a lot of talk in this trial about anti muslim sentiment and anti muslim feeling in the community
3665016 prejudice sympathy and such things have no part in a criminal trial
3665017 it is important that you determine the case on the evidence you have heard not on any other idea or comment you may have heard
3665018 it is important that you dont do any research of your own
3665019 you must consider each count and each accused as a completely separate trial
3665020 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3665021 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3665022 what i dont understand and what i dont really know at the moment is to whether theres any significance in respect of the crime scene
3665023 im asking for some advice and assistance from an offender profiler to look at the sequence of events to try and give us some better information on that
3665024 one of the things i am asking to be done is to have these killings checked nationally to see if there are any other linked offences of a similar nature
3665025 our lives matter sex workers unite for health and rights
3665026 active faculty participation in pro bono work is highly important for the sake of their students law teachers teach as much about professional responsibility by what they do as by what they say if our conduct and actions are inconsistent with the principles and rules that we teach we undermine both our credibility as teachers and the legitimacy of the ethical principles and rules themselves
3665027 that all law schools adopt a formal policy to encourage and support faculty members to perform pro bono work
3665028 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us

3665033 todav a no estamos en paz pero estamos con un cese temporal de las hostilidades que es ciertamente significativo
3665034 todav a hay mucho trabajo por hacer la noche es joven
3665035 creo que estos son buenos principios para resolver el problema para terminar con esta situaci n dram tica estos principios pueden ser utilizados tanto por georgia como osetia del sur
3665036 si el lado georgiano est realmente decidido a firmarlo y a replegar sus tropas a las posiciones originales y hace lo que estipulan estos principios entonces se abrir la senda hacia la normalizaci n gradual de la situaci n en osetia del sur ahora depende de georgia
3665037 es absolutamente normal que rusia quiera defender los intereses de sus compatriotas en su pa s y de los rus fonos fuera de rusia

3665041 we dont say yes or no to israeli military operations israel is a sovereign country
3665042 we are in very close contact with the israelis and we talk about the diplomatic track that were on
3665043 theyve said that diplomacy can work here and i know theyre doing their part to talk to all of the countries with which they have good relations to explain why its important to have a tough edge to our diplomacy
3665044 were on a diplomatic course and thats the important thing
3665045 i dont know what the iranians would do without the revenue that they receive from selling oil and so the idea that they would somehow deprive the world of iranian oil exports would have to have a pretty devastating effect on iran itself
3665046 can military strikes destroy irans gas centrifuge program probably not
3665047 this analogy is grossly misleading it neglects the important differences between a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment program and a reactor based program and fails to account for the dispersed relatively advanced and hardened nature of irans gas centrifuge facilities
3665048 it also ignores the years iran has had to acquire centrifuge items abroad often illicitly allowing it to create reserve stocks of critical equipment and raw materials

3665056 dort gab es kein krematorium also auch keine gaskammern und dies bedeutete da einer der zum muselman geworden war nicht schnurstracks ins gas gebracht werden konnte sondern erst wenn ein sogenannter krankentransport nach auschwitz zusammengestellt wurde

3665060 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3665061 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3665062 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3665063 i prefer to store the memories that still linger of open spaces fields and watermelons olive and almond trees
3665064 i remember the horse that was tied to the mulberry tree in the yard and how i climbed on to it and was thrown off and got a beating from my mother i remember the butterflies and the clear feeling that everything was open the village stood on a hill and everything was spread out below
3665065 there has been much discussion about where mahmoud should be laid to rest
3665066 before settling on ramallah the palestinian leadership suggested a request should be made to israel to let him be buried here in judeidi but mahmoud was never a son of judeidi his soul belonged to birwa
3665067 i would like my son to be buried here but he isnt just my son hes the entire arab worlds son
3665068 mahmoud and his poetry belonged to the whole palestinian people and it is better that his final resting place is where all palestinians can visit him
3665069 raises a host of ethical questions that have inescapable implications for the future
3665070 we were in the high court last week to stop them from obliterating the remains of the cemetery
3665071 they wanted to extend the shed right across the graves but the courts have put a halt to the work for the time being
3665072 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3665073 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3665074 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3665075 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3665076 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3665077 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3665078 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3665079 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3665080 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3665081 a man going on a sarha wanders aimlessly not restricted by time and place
3665082 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3665083 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3665084 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3665085 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3665086 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3665087 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3665088 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3665089 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3665090 this incident was unacceptable to me and the executive board

3665094 the united states should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council and call on russia to reverse course
3665095 the united states should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
3665096 i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks between the various parties on behalf of stability
3665097 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3665098 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister vladmir putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the united states and europe
3665099 we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3665100 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with roles come responsibilities to act as force for progress in this new century not regression into conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3665101 must work with russia to make sure every one of its nuclear weapons and every cache of nuclear material is secured

3665104 it is real important to be brave so you are not afraid to fight boys
3665105 we all have to do things we dont like sometimes
3665106 courage is when you are brave about something you fear
3665107 if youre afraid to smoke and you decide to do it thats not being courageous
3665108 when you are courageous you do something hard like a fireman
3665109 it is important to be courageous because you can save someone
3665110 courage means to be brave not to be scared just like shadrach meshach and abed nego
3665111 they were courageous because they stood up to king nebuchadnezzar
3665112 you wont have as much fun because you will always be scared of almost everything
3665113 nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result
3665114 if you really need courage dont ask your neighbor ask the lord
3665115 for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god
3665116 it took courage for god to allow the soldiers to beat jesus and to hang him on the cross it took courage for jesus to die on the cross
3665117 for god has not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
3665118 theres no doubt that when it comes to our treatment of native americans as well as other persons of color in this country weve got some very sad and difficult things to account for
3665119 i personally would want to see our tragic history or the tragic elements of our history acknowledged
3665120 i consistently believe that when it comes to whether its native americans or african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds

3665212 from my perspective i had been expecting oil to level off because thats the way the futures markets were pricing it so it seemed that if that happened headline inflation would abate a bit at least
3665213 now with the decline in energy prices and assuming that sticks that clearly improves the inflation outlook relative to what i was earlier expecting

3665266 die daten die wir in den vergangenen drei vier wochen gesehen haben geben uns nicht viel hoffnung dass sich die amerikanische autoindustrie sehr schnell erholen wird
3665267 wir gehen davon aus dass der lpreis im n chsten jahr zwischen 130 und 140 dollar liegen wird f r den benzinpreis rechnen wir mit vier bis 4 5 dollar pro gallone dies ist eine sehr konservative planung und wir sprechen von einem markt in amerika mit 14 statt normal 17 millionen fahrzeugen und einem gm marktanteil von 20 bis 21 prozent
3665268 das k uferverhalten war seit vielen jahren nicht mehr so schlecht wir sp ren die immobilien krise und wir haben es mit geschockten verbrauchern zu tun mit vier dollar pro gallone benzin wurde die schmerzgrenze erreicht dazu addieren sich der schwache gebrauchtwagenmarkt und die allgemeine inflation
3665269 die verk ufe im ausland gehen nach oben obwohl ich mit blick auf das kommende jahr nicht sicher bin dass die wirtschaft au erhalb der usa weiterhin so stark wachsen wird wie bisher
3665270 das wachstum in den einzelnen m rkten hat sich ber mehrere monate abgek hlt ich habe geh rt dass die immobilien krise in spanien noch schlimmer ist als in amerika und italien sieht auch nicht gut aus der absatz wird uns etwas schwerer fallen als wir es uns vorgestellt hatten
3665271 ber die n chsten f nf jahre wird sich der zuwachs zwar abschw chen aber die basis ist einfach riesig und zehn bis 15 prozent sind immer noch ein gro es wachstum in den letzten jahren ist russland f r gm schneller als china gewachsen
3665272 und in den ersten sechs monaten haben die gm abs tze um unglaubliche 60 prozent zugelegt wenn wir uns die n chsten f nf jahre ansehen werden 80 prozent des wachstums in diesen aufstrebenden m rkten stattfinden die traditionellen m rkte sind sehr wichtig aber in den neuen w chst man nicht nur schneller sondern auch meist profitabler

3665279 there are encouraging signs for crude capacity with summer field start ups in nigeria and angola and a reportedly imminent capacity boost in saudi arabia which could raise opec spare capacity from julys very low level of 1 5 million barrels per day

3665289 i would see people gearing up for fathers day weekend and all the excitement and wondered are there other people who feel that same way i do who feel the tremendous absence
3665290 my dad was very serious and people would accuse me of that and he was driven and im driven probably because he drove me
3665291 i think that is a regret that he never got to see me work here
3665292 thats a special kind of character that truly beloved scapegoat yet theres a room full of people who would walk across crushed glass for him
3665293 hes one of those people you get to meet in your life and say im going to remember him forever

3665295 reforms to empty property relief are aimed at ensuring a fair balance between incentives to re let property and giving property owners a period of relief while they manage vacancies
3665296 the rateable value of the units demolished would have incurred a cost of well over 150 000 per year to our clients a cost that until then had not been necessary in demolishing these factory units we have undoubtedly lost some major assets not just as far as our client is concerned but also as in respect of the city of sunderland
3665297 had the other units not been available i am certain that the businesses now utilising the space would have been lost elsewhere potentially overseas they will never be built again in this style
3665298 the result will be a slowdown in the regeneration of deprived areas and higher rents when demand begins to recover
3665299 this is an ill conceived move that is hurting regeneration and reducing the supply of affordable property that is essential for business

3665347 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3665348 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3665349 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3665350 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3665351 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3665352 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3665440 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time

3665444 we learnt from our mistakes that we made against zamalek and we have been working very hard to make some corrections
3665445 these games are about keeping possession and we tended to give it away in the last game against zamalek but i have seen some improvement in that regard
3665446 we were not giving away possession that much and i expect to play like that in egypt
3665447 we have played two games in which i feel we did very well and we are just expecting to improve and fight for a good result
3665448 you obviously want to have every player around but these things happen in football im not complaining because we have to be prepared for such things
3665449 we have got a number of players who can do well in those positions and we have confidence in them

3665456 im excited to have you in my childs life this year
3665457 a draw away from home is a good result but i felt we should have won the game
3665458 match officials have been giving us a raw deal for the last three weeks and i do not think its fair for the referee to decide which team must win
3665459 our performance improved especially in the second half and with a bit of luck we could have wrapped up the match however i am worried about the strikers who failed to convert easy chances as they lacked the killer instinct
3665460 oh thats right over by the seafood store youve always wanted to go to
3665461 i like those moments where everything converges and suddenly youre ok maybe you were not ok that morning your neighbor chainsawed the shit out of something at 6 am and then you tripped down the porch stairs and broke your face and fuck youve been crabby this week no ones been immune and you know that habit you have of losing your wallet and spilling your drink somehow you did that to your entire life these past few months though the chaos didnt come from an unhappy place but while youre saner and healthier than youve been in your entire life everything still isnt ok growing pains disorganization something so you spend a lot evenings feeling like you have a concussion or like you stepped on the wrong train and didnt realize until you were halfway to delaware its not the deep terror and despair of evenings past its a subtle confusion like waking up from surgery youre safe youre fine but what the fuck just happened
3665462 someone who flies a lot isnt necessarily loyal if what theyre doing is buying the lowest priced ticket every time they fly thats not the kind of loyalty we want to reward we want to reward those people who pay a premium for the services we offer

3665468 my answer is simple lets fight on the fields not outside of them
3665469 if they were georgian that certainly would have been an influence
3665470 i want to congratulate them and i do not want there to be a war between us
3665471 i wanted to support them because they have families there

3665478 this was the only way that i could get people to take notice of what happened to my son
3665479 this road is too dangerous many drivers simply ignore the speed limit i decided to put myself in the same place where i watched my son die to try and get the message across
3665480 joe was hit that hard that he was flung across the road my partner cradled him in his arms while he died and i dont want anyone else to go through my pain joe was a lovely young man who was cruelly taken away from his family hopefully something will be done about the speed limit on this road i know that redcar and cleveland council are looking at it at the minute
3665481 we sympathise with the reasons for her actions our main concern is of course her safety and that of other road users
3665482 cones and slow down signs were placed at appropriate points of the road and officers remained at the scene until she moved away just after lunchtime
3665483 police and council experts are aware of concerns about this stretch of road and are working closely to address issues surrounding it
3665484 we did not lose that much time from the earthquake
3665485 the chinese are brilliant at recovering and i cannot speak too highly of them the quality of workmanship is excellent
3665486 it is nice to be standing next to stan here in bishop auckland considering it could have been standing halfway round the world covered in rubble or water
3665487 stan laurel is one of bishop aucklands most famous sons and he is going into his rightful place at theatre corner which was the eden theatre where his father was manager
3665488 the people of bishop auckland will really look forward to seeing him for the first time and i am sure they will fall in love with him
3665489 one of the curious ironies of the nhs and many other health systems like it is that it does not pay enough attention to health focusing instead on illhealth and disease the nhs diagnoses and treats rather than predicts and prevents
3665490 the government needs to shift this balance as the increasing cost of lifestylerelated diseases such as diabetes obesity and some forms of cancer will prove financially unsustainable making the nhs unaffordable
3665491 changing peoples behaviour is difficult and merely giving people information and advice is known to be ineffective
3665492 bold action on the part of the government should include taking tough action to control levels of fat sugar and salt in foods as well as trying to narrow the income gap between rich and poor
3665493 if it was invented tomorrow it would be a class a controlled drug
3665494 specific actions include setting up a regional office for alcohol based on the highly successful fresh smoke free north east model it will co ordinate social marketing lobbying and regional action to tackle high rates of consumption as well as alcohol related injury and illness
3665495 funding has been agreed with the regions primary care trusts and it is hoped the office will be up and running by the end of the year
3665496 any initiative that is going to tackle alcohol abuse will be welcome but it is important to distinguish between alcohol consumption and alcohol misuse
3665497 the vast majority of the public drink responsibly but a minority are out of control
3665498 you need to tackle misuse by a minority rather than the majority of sensible drinkers
3665499 we need to move to a culture where alcohol is treated with respect rather than this sledgehammer approach of trying to hammer all alcohol drinks
3665500 most of the people who attended our shows couldnt believe that we were zimbabweans
3665501 they thought we were congolese had it not been for the shona lyrics in our songs
3665502 the aim of the whole project was to unite artistes while at the same time according upcoming artistes a chance to be recognised
3665503 we are encouraging black people that when a different race looks down upon them they shouldnt wish they were not born black
3665504 everything thats godly must conquer evil and people should not put their trust in gold and silver but in god
3665505 working with various artistes brings out the real you and makes you more versatile you learn how to perfect your lyrics and make them sound more better the exchange of ideas puts you in a better place than before and also helps you create a better feel to every song
3665506 if you dont make efforts to promote yourself these people recording companies are never going to do it for you
3665507 they dont concentrate on us much but on big artistes most of whom have started their own marketing companies
3665508 if you dont market distribute and sell your own music no one does it for you and this on the other hand is also a big disadvantage because rather than concentrating on your next album much of your time is wasted while selling your music
3665509 that led to my first project with utsiwegota booker t and major e then i used to call myself big silk but fortune muparutsa changed it to malvin s after my real name

3665511 but typical dominic cork ill come back and i will haunt lancashire and come back hopefully and prove the manager mike watkinson and the committee wrong
3665512 i just want to play as dominic cork always plays with his heart on his sleeve for any club i can help
3665513 im a keen lover of the game still at 37 im still very fit i still work very hard and still have a lot to offer in the game
3665514 id like to stay in the first division but that doesnt matter to me i want to go to a club who want to take on a very experienced bowler
3665515 i still feel ive got two or three years left and wherever i go im sure ill give it my all and ill come back to old trafford and hopefully show them why they should have kept me on the staff
3665516 it was a decision that the cricket committee have made to enable a little bit of movement of older players to open up the opportunities to the younger players in the wings
3665517 he is very committed to lancashires championship campaign he would enjoy nothing better than to have success in that competition
3665518 we are very happy to continue our relationship for the remainder of the season which he is contracted for
3665519 this announcement today has been put together jointly with myself and dominic to make sure that it does not have any impact on our championship cricket for the remainder of the season
3665520 we hope dominic will have a key role to play for us until the end of the season that puts him on a platform to demonstrate what his qualities are
3665521 he is certainly keen to play at the highest level for next season and probably beyond
3665522 today we have picked our best side for a championship game and dominic cork is in it at this moment in time we have picked the best side and his name is on the sheet
3665523 he was one of my signings as well i brought him to lancashire he has put his heart and soul into lancashire cricket
3665524 but by far the greatest motivation to pray to god in my life is when god initiates the conversation its a bit like the idea that we only love god because he first loved us its him who initiates it when god initiates conversation speak to me gets through my thick skull ear wax or whatever then i talk back to him there and then
3665525 but by far the greatest motivation to pray to god in my life is when god initiates the conversation

3665540 i and a lot of my friends used to be against him
3665541 but hes our president we elected him and if we dont like him well remove him ourselves without russia this war has made georgia united
3665542 the situation is very difficult in the country i think that there is no time for internal political disputes
3665543 under such conditions it is an unwritten law internal political confrontations and disputes should be stopped
3665544 theres nothing wrong with me and ive been living in the area for 40 odd years
3665545 if they want me to move theyll have to put me in chains and throw me in the back of a paddy wagon police van
3665546 but its the psychological battle that theyre playing burying things in front of us that were part of our town they want to pretend the place never existed
3665547 we do camp cooking outside at night its like an alternative lifestyle and theres no rules sometimes we have the town to ourselves its like living on an island
3665548 these are people who parachuted in after the mine closed and bought a house for nothing seeking to profit from the notoriety of wittenoom

3665555 im very proud of the ep we shot and the series is making me crazy with the excitement
3665556 but i tend to come at things sideways and there were a few clarity issues for some viewers there were also some slight issues with tone i was in a dark noir kind of place where as many of you know i make my home and didnt bring the visceral pop the network had expected from the script the network was cool about it but not sure how to come out of the gate with the ep
3665557 the network truly gets the premise this is a whole new crew as you know loves the cast is excited about the show
3665558 but theyre also specific about how they want to bring people to the show and i not only respect that i kinda have to slap my forehead that i didnt tailor my tone and structure to the networks needs since thats something i pride myself on

3665561 i think barack obama is doing pretty well without my endorsement
3665562 i was held in a restaurant and physically and forcibly restrained there
3665563 i tried to explain to these people that i was a journalist but they dragged me out and slung me in in the back of a police van and held me there for another few minutes
3665564 nobody punched me but they were very forceful and i have a cut knee and a bruise on my finger
3665565 they basically dragged me into the restaurant and then out and took my shoes off me
3665566 i was able to eventually show them my journalist credentials and they realised i was a british journalist and the next time the door of the van opened i was able to walk out
3665567 they did ask me in english what my views were on tibet and i said i dont have any views im a journalist
3665568 i was there purely to report on a protest and took no part in the protest itself
3665569 we then contacted the british embassy and they are taking it up at consular level
3665570 we are aware of the incident and have spoken directly to john ray
3665571 we have expressed our strong concern to the chinese authorities and we are pleased that he has been released

3665582 we realized the tremendous impact you can have with comic con
3665583 the fanatics who come to an event like this really propel your awareness and hopefully boost the have to have qualities in these properties they become must see and it starts with word of mouth
3665584 nbc took care of the shows they owned like heroes and bionic woman
3665585 we realized that if were going to use comic con to benefit our business it was going to have to be a studio
3665586 our customers and clients have become the consumers themselves as opposed to the networks or the trade press
3665587 theyre the ones going to itunes buying the dvds streaming on hulu or buying the t shirts any opportunity to build the relationship with the consumer we take
3665588 i was mentioning writers but eliza kept saying dont you want to do it dont you want to do it look how cute i am and shes really cute
3665589 eliza and i are seldom in the same place for very long and im an old married guy shes a lot younger and bubblier

3665606 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought
3665607 with rpi inflation reaching 5 in july an acceleration in pay growth cannot be ruled out and even if it stays subdued the mpc has plenty of other inflation concerns which are likely to keep rates on hold for another couple of months at least
3665608 we are certainly having to be a bit more careful with the values of houses we are putting on the market
3665609 vendors are having to drop their prices lately weve been embarrassed with some of the offers weve had for a house valued at 200 000 or more people are offering 50 000 less
3665610 we are just finishing houses to a certain level at the moment
3665611 it has been very quiet in the last 12 months
3665612 people are going to out of town centres because car parks are so expensive here there are also too many second hand shops to compete with
3665613 people are more value conscious at the moment they are travelling further afield to come here
3665614 especially a lot more younger people in the last year
3665615 unfortunately the developer has experienced a delay in the opening of the bowling alley due to the original operator going into administration
3665616 cash is becoming increasingly tighter for companies and there has been a reduction in the number of people becoming employed
3665617 theres also a reduction in the amount of interest in entrepreneurship and a drop in the number of people indicating that they are prepared to go into business
3665618 the welsh assembly is not as committed to investment as they were three or four years ago we need to see more investment from the welsh assembly especially in entrepreneurship they are too focused on internal staff costs

3665626 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3665627 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3665628 we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3665629 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3665630 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary

3665650 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas high rates of fertility and births to single women particularly among more acculturated u s born latinas
3665651 the sample for this study was a low income population
3665652 our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups
3665653 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3665654 women who were us born were significantly more likely than mexican born women to meet the cutoff score 21 on the ces d scale
3665655 women who conducted their interview in english were significantly more likely to express depressive symptoms compared to women who conducted their interview in spanish

3665668 the girl has been transported in critical condition to the hospital
3665669 it took a long time to get that girl stabilized
3665670 so i put my shoes on grabbed my gun and as soon as i walked around the corner the dog was attacking her right outside the front yard
3665671 to be honest with you i was afraid to go in the door
3665672 the little girl was laying on the floor in the trailer there and nobody was doing anything i went and put pressure on her neck where the dog bit her
3665673 i just did what i could and the paramedics came and took over

3665683 opened up the floodgates for people to respect different cultures and also respect our beauty in each culture
3665684 young girls look at magazines and want to see a reflection of themselves and that will tell them that they exist and that they are beautiful
3665685 so we need asians we need black we need latin we need every culture represented in fashion to show that young girl that she matters that she exists and that she is beautiful
3665686 i think they did it issue an arrest warrant to pretty much scare us from coming back

3665745 i cant put into words how im feeling i came here for one thing and ive not got it
3665746 i gave it everything and i didnt make any real mistakes i was just caught out
3665747 i am really happy with how things have gone at a new club but it has been that way because i like the players i have joined and they like me
3665748 i dont want to make any predictions about what im going to achieve all i can look to do is have a good season and do the best that i can
3665749 we have submitted a bid and we are waiting for arsenal to respond weve given it our best offer and we hope that it happens but if it doesnt we move on
3665750 you just have to stick in there i knew we could get it back we were playing brilliant
3665751 there is still 27m net to pay on transfers that were done before i came so probably in the latter years before we came in you could argue that the club was beginning to lose its way
3665752 it has also already taken up front payments from commercial deals and sponsorships which didnt help us at all it seemed as though the club was in a very downward spiral one it would have found hard to come out of
3665753 at first i thought it couldnt be true i was out of the country but my reply was if he is interested then tell him ill meet him anywhere as soon as i get back
3665754 kevin is a great manager and he is happiest working with the players
3665755 but theres so much involved in running a club that you must make sure people arent spread too thinly how could kevin devote all his time to the first team if he also had to look after the academy

3665810 wegen australien haben wir nicht wirklich gewusst dass wir auf dem falschen fu gestartet waren wir haben es selbst nicht so richtig verstanden wir k nnen dieses jahr aber noch ein paar dinge umkehren nat rlich nicht v llig aber wir k nnen uns verbessern und es ist f r uns wichtig ein paar gute rennen zu fahren
3665811 nat rlich f hle ich mich gut ich bin seit langer zeit beim team ich komme gut mit allen aus also ist es sch n nur das auto ist nicht schnell genug
3665812 sie wollen alle gewinnen das ist etwas das nicht alle teams haben das ist etwas positives
3665813 nichts ist besser als den kurs mit den fahrern abzugehen ber probleme zu reden sich die kerbs anzusehen die auslaufzonen zu betrachten und zu schauen wie nahe man an der mauer ist
3665814 eine normale strecke w rde man in 15 oder sogar zehn runden lernen aber auf einem stra enkurs wird es l nger dauern vielleicht 20 runden um sich einzustellen es wird wichtig sein das auto auf der strecke zu halten denn wenn man einen unfall hat verliert man viel zeit
3665815 es war 2007 eigentlich alles bereit f r kubica aber eine verpflichtung in letzter minute hat es dann doch verhindert
3665816 auf basis von coulthards leistung gegen webber coulthard begann auf dem option reifen entschieden wir es zu riskieren wir waren in der phase wegen der probleme beim start ohnehin nirgendwo also riskierten wir es mit kazuki was bedeutete dass wir viel mehr benzin in den tank taten als wir das in ungarn normal tun w rden
3665817 das w nscht man sich zwar nicht aber auch das geh rt dazu denn die entwicklungskurve eines formel 1 autos l uft nicht einfach linear nach oben bei uns war sie anfang saison besonders steil jetzt ist sie ein wenig abgeflacht
3665818 ob das genug ist oder nicht ist eine andere sache
3665819 ich wei genau was ich bew ltigen muss ich kenne die vor mir liegende herausforderung also kann ich besser planen ich bin zufrieden damit dass ich es vielleicht auf die harte tour gelernt habe denn es ist gut zu lernen 2009 werden wir ein viel st rkeres force india team sehen
3665820 ich habe zwei gute fahrer und man muss verstehen dass meine bed rfnisse f r force india recht einzigartig sind die erfahrung von giancarlo ist unbezahlbar f r mich und adrian hat viel talent ich denke er wird von rennen zu rennen besser wird konstanter ich bin recht gl cklich mit ihnen noch wichtiger ist sie haben eine tolle einstellung mit der ich mich den herausforderungen von morgen stellen kann und ich denke sie werden sehr zufrieden sein wenn sie das 2009er auto fahren von dem ich mir sicher bin dass es eine gro e verbesserung und eine gro e berraschung sein wird

3665823 das ist ein heikles thema das ist eine reine anekdote aus zweiter oder sogar dritter hand aber es gibt da die geschichte dass einer der red bull fahrer aus seinem renault angetriebenen auto sprang und dann den ferrari angetriebenen wagen fuhr und meinte verdammte h lle richtig oder falsch das wei ich nicht und ich will damit auch nicht den finger auf ferrari richten
3665824 es l uft so dass man eine blaupause des motors macht wenn man ihn erstmals einsetzt die wird an die fia geschickt und dort archiviert wenn man dann zur halbzeit der saison probleme mit den kolbenringen hat und sehr viele gebrochen sind dann kann man unter vorlage von beweisen sagen dass man probleme hat und die fia wird einen den kolbenring oder dieses und jenes ndern lassen
3665825 wir sind hier um jedes rennen voll zu bestreiten und nicht ein halbes jahr wir haben zwei verschiedene programme eines das im moment viel mehr ressourcen hat als das andere
3665826 in der pause im august haben wir genug zeit auf den pr fst nden um f r valencia wirklich alles ordentlich zu scannen und zu tunen
3665827 es gab einige gr nde f r die aufh ngung einiges davon war auch wegen der neu organisierten gruppe die ein einigerma en gro es projekt abarbeiten sollte bevor es an das neue auto geht wir haben ein paar neue manager in der firma und wir haben auch ein neues cad system also war es gut ein recht gro es projekt zu haben um das system zu pr fen denn wir konnten es uns nicht leisten operative probleme zu haben
3665828 die hersteller verstehen dass sie unabh ngige teams brauchen sonst gibt es nur f nf hersteller teams die herumfahren und das ist in niemandes interesse
3665829 das wird die kosten reduzieren und ich denke niemand kann abstreiten dass dies der weg ist den wir gehen sollen
3665830 wir haben motoren f r zwei rennen und das sollten wir nach m glichkeit ausbauen alle waren in der lage damit umzugehen die formel 1 braucht kleinere teams im moment ist es sehr hart umk mpft und wir liegen innerhalb von zwei sekunden hinter der schnellsten rundenzeit und das machen wir mit 120 millionen dollar
3665831 es wird uns schmerzen dass vettel im kommenden jahr nicht bei uns ist
3665832 wenn man sich die elektronischen systeme ansieht dann ist das recht normale technologie weswegen die leute sich eher daf r entscheiden als f r die etwas komplizierteren mechanischen systeme die viele probleme machen
3665833 das macht das leben einerseits recht einfach aber es bedeutet auch dass wir im vergleich zu einigen konkurrenten immer auf der rasierklinge spazieren wir k mpfen immer vielleicht sehen sie uns manchmal als ein wenig aggressiv aber wir m ssen uns um uns k mmern
3665834 ich denke aber auch dass wir uns gut um die partner k mmern weil wir das m ssen wir haben wirklich die einstellung dass wir uns um die leute k mmern und das kommt von franks seite es gibt also leute die bei einem unabh ngigen team sein wollen sie wollen aber nicht bei einem schwachen team sein sie wollen bei einem konkurrenzf higen team sein wir hatten unsere hochs und tiefs aber ich denke wir sind immer noch ein f hrendes team in der formel 1 wir m ssen das nur besser demonstrieren

3665936 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3665937 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3665938 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3665939 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3665940 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3665941 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3665942 en la teor a con paolo tenemos volumen de juego no vamos a descubrir la capacidad de paolo la idea es hacer un buen armado si est frangipane vamos a trabajar en rombo con un sistema cl sico pero para el futuro no est descartada la posibilidad de trabajar con un sistema de tres con paolo en cancha
3665943 son alternativas y se van a manejar de acuerdo a lo prosecuci n de los partidos
3665944 el mensaje al plantel es abstraerse de todo esto m s all de que es un cl sico hablo del entorno del hincha vamos a encarar un juego para ganar es un partido m s pero con la importancia desde lo psicol gico porque es un cl sico
3665945 por el marco aunque el equipo debe acostumbrarse a jugar en todos lados
3665946 uno siempre propone ganar los partidos de todos modos es un juego y hay veces que se puede y otras que no pero si no se puede ganar un resultado positivo ser a un empate
3665947 se ponder la actitud el orden t ctico pero en cuanto al volumen de juego por momentos se intent aunque no se plasm en esa autocr tica fuimos muy transparentes porque es la realidad y en eso hacemos hincapi pues m s all de que hay que mejorar tambi n se vieron cosas positivas
3665948 en principio no le puedo decir al t cnico que est en condiciones de jugar veremos aunque tampoco le puedo afirmar que no va a jugar

3665950 ho cominciato la mia carriera artistica appena terminato listituto darte cellini di valenza racconta e ho fatto la mia prima mostra personale nel 1979 quando avevo 28 anni mi ispiro a paul klee a mir a kandinskij e a keith haring ma non mi considero parte di una qualche ben definita corrente artistica mi lascio andare a seconda dello stato danimo del momento non faccio mai schizzi preparatori a volte dico di essere io stesso lo schizzo preparatorio nel 1997 ho realizzato una serie di 26 dipinti per gioielli ispirati a pinocchio e stata la prima volta che una fiaba si trasformata in ornamento ho realizzato anche opere ispirate ai disegni di fellini e alle commedie di dario fo lo scorso 29 aprile poi ho tenuto un laboratorio creativo sulloreficeria longobarda presso i musei civici di pavia ho organizzato per un gruppo di ragazzi delle medie di pavia e di grottaminarda in provincia di benevento una trattoria creativa ho messo loro davanti una piastrella invece del piatto matite invece delle posate e li ho invitati a comporre con la cera pongo dei gioielli in stile longobardo seguendo le spiegazioni della piccola lezione da me tenuta la mattina
3665951 noi occidentali non sappiamo pi cogliere limportanza dellozio e della lentezza per cogliere lestetica del quotidiano il tempo secondo me il pi grande genio in fatto di pittura scultura e architettura ma noi non ce ne accorgiamo perch viviamo troppo al ritmo imposto dai media non sono sul mercato dellarte per mia scelta se qualcuno vedendo le mie opere le vuole comperare bene altrimenti amen voglio la mia indipendenza pi dei rapporti con le gallerie ritengo preziosi i rapporti con la gente che vedendo la porta aperta entra nel mio studio e si mette a dialogare certo la coerenza con le mie scelte mi rende in certi momenti la vita un po pi dura per guadagnare la pagnotta quotidiana mi sono imprestato allarte orafa disegno gioielli e preparo sculture in cera per la loro microfusione ma penso ne valga assolutamente la pena sempre per mia precisa volont non ho un sito internet n un indirizzo e mail dipende dal discorso fatto prima sui media che ci impediscono luso migliore del nostro tempo dal 2001 non ho neanche la tv un po perch in quellanno ha vinto berlusconi un po perch mi rendo conto di come possa diventare un mezzo potente per manipolare le persone
3665952 partecipo alle manifestazioni pacifiste e di partito fin dal 1975 ricorda ma quella stata lunica volta in cui ho provato un vero spavento la polizia a manganellate ha diviso in due il corteo di cui facevo parte per fortuna con i miei amici partiti in pullman da mede eravamo nella met giusta del corteo non abbiamo preso botte e abbiamo solo sentito odore di lacrimogeni quella notte c stata lirruzione della polizia alla scuola diaz questa esperienza per mi ha stimolato ho letto il libro fragili resistenti scelto trenta dei messaggi per carlo giuliani in esso contenuti e ho realizzato trenta tele poi esposte in piazza alimonda a genova nel luogo dove la famiglia giuliani il 20 di ogni mese chiunque voglia ricordare il loro parente scomparso era lagosto del 2005 al centro tutte le mie opere avevano dei dipinti per sculture gioiello intorno ho rinunciato ad usare i miei soliti colori per scrivere frasi tratte da libri e giornali che parlavano del g8 sempre sullargomento ho realizzato il quadro lo scampato che sarei io comunque tiene a precisare non intendo assolutamente pormi come maestro di vita e pensiero se qualcuno mi chiedesse il senso della vita gli risponderei con un candido boh molto umilmente da persona che si dichiara non credente in dio ma nelluomo e nelle cose quotidiane proseguo la mia ricerca voglio dedicarmi alla scultura per i prossimi 2 o 3 anni per approfondire la conoscenza del materiale sia tufo o altro chiamo le mie opere scultoree monoliti ispirandomi a quelle dellisola di pasqua che si dice vadano in giro la notte questo nome mi ricorda il momento in cui finita la prima non la trovavo pi se con la mia opera osservando la bellezza le forme e i colori sono destinato a trovare il senso della vita spero di trovarlo la sera prima di morire non so se riuscirei a sopportare quello che potrei scoprire

3665959 we counted the inventory and it came out as it should
3665960 what do you think that a double transaction for the same item isnt worthy of doing some accounting investigation what is to stop an employee from taking one when they know the inventory would be just fine
3665961 what planet do you live on employee theft is the number one cause of shrink in a store i work for a large retailer and employees do take money and products

3665967 what they seem to have managed is to maintain the mice at this young stage and both restore and maintain normal activity
3665968 hmmm nice try but i think ill stick with my ipod
3665969 i usually have my ipod in one of those silicone cases clipped to my waist and an apple ipod remote snaked up under my tee shirt with my shure e2cs plugged in
3665970 why have i been putting up with carrying two gadgets around with me all the time i must leave now to dispose of my ipod in a suitable manner
3665971 now we usually say 2 weeks but things almost exclusively go wrong if they are going to within the first 48 hours

3665973 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3665974 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3665975 yes we would like to send you out a retainer for two hundred thousand dollars to hold the rights to the story and then eventually youd have to sit down with one of our writers and finish the rest well spice it up of course and we can make you twenty years younger
3665976 goddamn it nate very funny making an ass of your mother you should be ashamed of yourself
3665977 what the hell were you thinking dad isnt even dead
3665978 the journals i told you about every time that weve talked on the phone for the last six months
3665979 well the books not done but the journals are being published regularly now theyve got distribution in thirty countries and in seventeen different languages and a total circulation of close to two million
3665980 i didnt think you could sell two million travel guides for riding a bike

3665986 its not funny if youre a chocolate thief then youre no son of mine
3665987 your asshole father hes the cause of all of this i knew there was something wrong before i even married him i should have poisoned him on our wedding night and go it over from the start
3665988 can you hold on mom it might be a producer or publisher
3665989 how sweet of you nate i knew you couldnt forget me
3665990 n nnn n no i mean i dream of you

3665995 i knew all that stuff that id been reading about you wasnt true
3665996 they want to make everyone think you did it nate everything is planned out theyre framing you but i wont let them
3665997 financially the club really was in a difficult position i really think the club had overextended itself
3665998 one of the most unfortunate things about the clubs finances was the amount of money still owed on players signed in comparison to the amount of income due off players who had gone
3665999 there is still 27m net to pay on transfers done before i came in the latter years before we came in you could argue the club was beginning to lose its way
3666000 the premier league is appealing but celtic are the biggest team in scotland and are known everywhere
3666001 but newcastle have very good fans and i am flattered by their interest also but we have to wait it does not depend on me
3666002 there is so much that needs to be done for a transfer but a move to the united kingdom is the one i want to move my career forward
3666003 the champions league qualifiers are our biggest games of the season but we have left a big squad at home and i am not left with many options
3666004 basically it is a choice of a young player or an even younger one ramsey has a lot to learn he has a fantastic engine is good on the ball with a reasonable technique although he has to improve that
3666005 but i have never known such a problematic start to a season as well as fabregas we are without toure senderos nasri diaby rosicky eduardo song and amaury bischoff the trouble is when you have to play champions league qualifiers so early you push players and they get injuries which is what has happened

3666015 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
3666016 america and europes actions on kosovo left russia feeling threatened encircled and more convinced that it had to take aggressive measures to restore its power dignity and influence in a region it considers its strategic backyard
3666017 russia cannot allow georgia to solve the south ossetia problem by military means
3666018 of course the deaths of russian peacekeepers and the destruction caused by the invading georgians is an important reason why medvedev has ordered russian forces to intervene in the conflict but there are bigger strategic reasons behind that moscow cannot let saakashvili succeed in his gamble
3666019 we must make clear that nato welcomes the membership aspirations of georgia and ukraine and offers them a clear path forward towards that goal my countrys position is clear nato should welcome georgia and ukraine into the membership action plans
3666020 though nato does not want to show it truly sides with saakashvili at the latest summit the president got a permit to start a military operation
3666021 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state reloaded not comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
3666022 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3666023 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders
3666024 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on us russian relations
3666025 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
3666026 for the bush administration the choice now becomes whether backing georgia which more than any other former soviet republic has allied with the united states on the south ossetia issue is worth alienating russia at a time when getting russias help to rein in irans nuclear ambitions is at the top of the united states foreign policy agenda
3666027 directing the individual project correctly will ensure it is done right directing all the projects successfully will ensure we are doing the right projects
3666028 the band heaven and hell would like to apologize for not having played neon knights in jones beach in wantagh new york nor at pnc in holmdel new jersey on the metal masters tour much to their extreme dismay they had technical issues both nights that caused them to have to leave the stage prior to completing their set they would never intentionally be discourteous to people that are there to see them and leave the stage without playing every possible second they could and of all songs neon knights is one of their favorites to play again many apologies for the unfortunate circumstances
3666029 here we go another track for those that enjoyed the last one and possibly one for those that werent sure to now see a different facet of the band this one is a bit faster and heavier so enjoy

3666050 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3666051 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3666052 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3666053 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3666054 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3666055 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3666056 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3666057 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3666058 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3666059 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3666060 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3666061 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3666062 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3666063 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3666064 creo que son buenos principios para poner fin a esta dram tica situaci n
3666065 si resurge la resistencia o se realizan acciones agresivas entonces debe dar los pasos para destruirlos
3666066 es claramente justificada la indignaci n de la sociedad al sentir su amenazada tranquilidad y su seguridad personal y familiar

3666074 dat er te weinig kaart getrokken wordt voor onze jeugd tvv buitenlanders is trouwens iets waar ik ook mee akkoord ga net als vele andere voetbalsupp wss
3666075 maar dat in diezelfde tijd de kabinetssecretaris van jean luc dehaene voor een half miljoen meubels kreeg van de befaamde lobbyist koen blijweert dat weet niemand meer het wordt zelfs niet netjes geacht daarvan nog melding te maken aernoudts boekje is helaas meer dan pure anekdotiek
3666076 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3666077 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3666078 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3666079 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3666080 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3666081 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3666082 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3666083 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3666084 from what i can tell it has changed significantly a lot of students are going to the beach or the lake and they are taking a lot parents with them
3666085 i never would have thought that we would be here three years later talking about it and were really not any further along than we were in the first few weeks
3666086 oh wow it has been three years three years exactly she and i were in classes together when i was in mountain brook it was a complete shock but i didnt realize it had been exactly three years
3666087 you have to vigilant at all times especially as a woman its very important be cautious in the world were in no place is perfectly safe not even mountain brook
3666088 finally finally i have been expecting to win for the last four years
3666089 i went into this not even ranked in the top 10 so to finish sixth is pretty good ive done a personal best time in my main event
3666090 its been such a great experience and ive really enjoyed being part of this team i would like to go to 2012 but four years is a long time
3666091 i gave it my best shot and thats all i can do
3666092 my plan was to go out fast yesterday i went out easier and my coach said i should go out faster and i think im back to my normal self
3666093 ive gone out under world record pace before i died a lot on the last length and on the last few metres my arms were really struggling
3666094 it was such a tough race it was good being next to natalie coughlin she pushed me through the first 100m and kirsty coventry swam amazingly as always
3666095 its a high level competition so its normal the most important thing is the final tomorrow
3666096 it was my dream to make my fourth final at the olympics this is a new period in time for swimming a whole new level new swim suits and a new generation its unbelievable

3666122 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3666123 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3666124 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3666125 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3666126 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3666127 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3666128 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3666129 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3666130 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3666131 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss

3666136 so you will know what marrying in the church is all about
3666137 accordingly in light of the conclusions we reach concerning the constitutional questions brought to us for resolution we determine that the language of section 300 limiting the designation of marriage to a union between a man and a woman is unconstitutional and must be stricken from the statute and that the remaining statutory language must be understood as making the designation of marriage available both to opposite sex and same sex couples
3666138 any believer in religious freedom any person who has knelt in prayer to the almighty has a friend and ally in me
3666139 they seek to remove from the public domain any acknowledgment of god religion is seen as merely a private affair with no place in public life it is as if they are intent on establishing a new religion in america the religion of secularism they are wrong
3666140 we believe that every single human being is a child of god we are all part of the human family
3666141 the consequence of our common humanity is our responsibility to one another to our fellow americans foremost but also to every child of god it is an obligation which is fulfilled by americans every day here and across the globe without regard to creed or race or nationality

3666170 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3666171 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3666172 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3666173 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3666174 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3666175 we have been lobbying constantly on this issue for many years and yet no one outside the county seems to be listening to us
3666176 without the extra track there is a real danger that the growth in new housing will far outstrip new jobs leading to a slowdown in the local economy more people commuting out of the area and the inevitable knock on effect of more congestion and carbon emissions
3666177 i once thought there was a good argument between whether its worth it to make a film where you confront the human condition or an escape film
3666178 you could argue that the fred astaire film is performing a greater service than the bergman film because bergman is dealing with a problem that youre never going to solve whereas fred astaire you walk in off the street and for an hour and half theyre popping champagne corks and making light banter and you get refreshed like a lemonade

3666196 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3666197 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3666198 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3666199 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3666200 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3666201 there were three levels of approval over the directors so we had to clip that off

3666210 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3666211 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3666213 he said he had put regular dish soap in the dishwasher and got suds all over the kitchen and i did that once too
3666214 and i said maybe theres a cleaning guidebook for guys
3666215 dont wait until you can actually see that your bedding needs washing
3666216 he said he had put regular dish soap in the dishwasher and got suds all over the kitchen and i did that once too
3666217 and i said maybe theres a cleaning guidebook for guys
3666218 dont wait until you can actually see that your bedding needs washing
3666219 we felt that men were playing a much more involved role in the home than was being portrayed in society
3666220 you see a lot of marketing directed toward mothers but we felt theres an increasing role that men are playing in families
3666221 ten or 15 years ago car companies were speaking primarily to men and assuming men were making the majority of car purchasing decisions only for research to show that women were really weighing in
3666222 i think the same is true for a lot of home decor and other home brands when it comes to speaking to men they want their home to reflect their personality as well
3666223 it should not have been a big wow that men were embracing their feminine side in 2003
3666224 if you go to the supermarket on the weekend its 40 percent male and theyre buying comparable goods to women
3666225 theres been a blurring of gender roles over the last decade and we have to think of who the homemaker is 25 years ago the homemaker was june cleaver but today it could be anybody we have to appeal to him or her thats the starting point and i dont think any brands are necessarily talking about the new homemakers
3666226 were intimidated by cleaning because we dont know how to do it
3666227 if you demystify it and we think we can do it faster and easier were on it
3666228 we have seen across all of home care that the male consumer is increasing in prevalence and ease of use
3666229 we talk about size of prize where are the largest consumer groups that we need to target and we really find that the women consumer is boss for the most part we think that women are making or influencing purchasing decisions
3666230 citrus mixed with green notes and a watery fresh impression
3666231 that story is really echoed in last years fragrance launches in cleaners theres a very similar fragrance story in mens fine fragrance and many of the new citrus scents in cleaners
3666232 you could make deductions on your own but in studying the category we would not say were seeing activity that specifically speaks to casting the net for cleaning products beyond women head of households to include men
3666233 however that being said there are these mega trends out there in the world that are totally gender neutral that are certainly hitting the cleaner category
3666234 im a single guy and i do theyre definitely a demographic that were aware of and watching but the lions share of the shopping within this category is being done by women head of households and even if shes not out there buying it shes a key influencer on the men in her life
3666235 packs 400 inch pounds of torque into a 4 pound package
3666236 is what we call permission to play in new categories for men
3666237 its very much in the realm of performance to get men to buy
3666238 you cant necessarily talk about thread count the way you can with women and get men to buy the sheets it might be telling men that they want the 200 thread count so they can get the size 2 girl
3666239 what we want to do is give men more permission to care about this stuff
3666240 children of the 70s and 80s are coming to their household formation stage and the landscape is much different those younger men have come to accept that there are jobs that they have to do as a household like cooking cleaning and housework and that those things will be shared
3666241 is no longer seen as an emasculating thing to be in the kitchen
3666242 was seen as a bit effete and appealed much more to a female audience
3666243 and theres nothing effeminate about his approach to the kitchen and i think thats an empowering thing for men to see
3666244 so the only time dad makes dinner is when he goes to mcdonalds
3666245 that commercial was like the lingua franca of dads dont cook
3666246 theres a giant sort of infrastructural bias against men as consumers in a number of different family related and household products
3666247 relentless greeting card cuteness combined with an overriding brightness of color and patterns tells me dads are just guests in babygap home
3666248 todays mom stays on top of the latest trends she wants her baby to be current and stylish
3666249 our goal is to be a trusted editor providing moms with everything they need and want in an aesthetic and sensibility thats unique only to babygap
3666250 we would never want to intentionally upset or leave out a gender
3666251 the reason we say mom is because when we did the online customer research before we created the home line we asked both genders to participate but the majority of people who got back to us were mothers
3666252 its not the 19th century they dont need us in some fundamental ways so we have to step up
3666253 marriage is more fragile and if men want to have kids and stay married they have to pick up the slack
3666254 if youre courting young women its a good idea to say that you cook
3666255 youll get two people in your corner the woman and her mother wholl say he cooks hes a keeper
3666256 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3666257 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3666294 i saw from the back cover that this was his first novel and decided to look at his web page he replied and noted that my area here in colorado springs might figure into one of his future novels something about norad or cheyenne mountain i forwarded his e mail to brian and suggested that maybe someday he might like to tour the mountain
3666295 it was like venturing into some kind of timewarp a journey to the place from which the apocalypse would have been monitored
3666296 but the most surreal part of it was to see on what hard times the place has fallen civilian contractors doing most of the work all the main operations transferred elsewhere and the base itself now on standby even so the whole thing was nothing short of awesome it was worth it just to ride the bus into the heart of mountain and see those gigantic blast doors
3666297 we understood nuclear attack and the weapons that might be deployed against us and built norad to look out for them
3666298 but it also highlighted to me how ineffective we are when the problem is more diffuse i write a lot about threats like unraveling ecosystems energy depletion and global warming and i cant help wondering if those might turn out to be our real blind spots its a bit of a pity that we never built a norad equivalent for environmental collapse
3666299 it was built by practical people for a very practical reason
3666300 theres very little frills in there its mostly machines on desks and a lot of plumbing
3666301 our guides explained that the infrastructure was designed and built by the u s navy and it shows
3666302 many of the sections within norad looked much like the inside of a submarine or a space station they maximized the available room with thin rooms and hallways across multiple levels
3666303 lifetimes of man hours were invested in the norad superstructure to deter soviet bombers that never came today the mission has evolved but it continues the tradition the dedication and the sense of honor are palpable i was proud to be there even for a few hours
3666304 i told them how this group has written about norad and cheyenne mountain in many novels and stories and that many of the writers were known worldwide
3666305 it was amazing to hear snippets ranging from what would happen if zombies or vampires were loose in cheyenne mountain to speculation on which floors were safest from electromagnetic pulses from the sun
3666306 the truth is that tour can be very long and very technical but somehow the group managed to be both entertained and entertaining the whole time
3666307 dont you feel proud when you do something make something i know you do so do i am sure everyone does

3666312 wahai anak saudaraku sungguh aku tahu bahwa kau anak baik baik tadi telah datang beberapa orang dari kaummu yang menuduh engkau selalu berbuat yang tidak baik engkau mengatakan sesuatu yang mereka tidak suka engkau menyakiti hati mereka nah aku pikir lebih baik engkau hentikan kata kata serupa itu

3666316 the man with the iron heart takes a look at the question
3666317 sometimes the fun house mirror of alternate history is an interesting way of trying to see where we really are now its also interesting to wonder how the soviet union remember the soviet union wouldve dealt with partisans especially after sponsoring so many during the war
3666318 there really was one but it started very late and had anything but unified command too many cooks often spoiled the broth
3666319 the one i chose was having reinhard heydrichs assassination fail so that he could survive and organize and lead the resistance
3666320 heydrich was one a cast iron son of a bitch two a capable cast iron son of a bitch and three a cast iron son of a bitch with rank enough to make the other high german officials take him seriously when he pointed out to them that the sky was falling
3666321 you need to remember that im also the guy who wrote both bedfellows about the boston marriage literally and metaphorically of w and osama and of news from the front which imagines a world war ii reported the way iraq has been

3666326 the non observance by turkey of rules and regulations governing air traffic constitutes a serious threat to the safety of air flights in the region and a breach of its international obligations
3666327 at the same time its attempt to upgrade contrary to security council resolutions an illegal secessionist entity in the occupied part of the republic of cyprus to the detriment of a sovereign country member of the united nations and the european union constitutes a blatant violation of international law and united nations resolutions with serious ramifications for the peace and stability of the region
3666328 it should finally heed international law and respect without any preconditions the independence and territorial integrity of the republic of cyprus in accordance with un resolutions thus contributing to the maintenance of stability and prosperity in the region

3666334 it is wanted its just tricky like so many things in israel
3666335 this is a delusional campaign for a minority with a normative defect
3666336 those who fail to recognize jerusalems holiness should stay away from it
3666337 like other religious countries trying to attract gay tourism like spain the government has turned over marketing to the local level or taken it underground
3666338 we wanted to make sure we honored and tied in the past with the present and future

3666353 i thought i was just going on a day trip for work and would come back that night so i didnt even bother closing my window
3666354 no the bottom floor is crushed under now the second floor is the first floor
3666355 my initial thought was that my family was alive so im one of the luckier ones but now coming back im not sure what to do
3666356 my first thought was it only took 10 hours thats quick
3666357 getting fit is great mentally and physically but ill always be a curvy girl and i think flesh and curves are beautiful and should be rejoiced
3666358 we actually all met for the first time on this photoshoot our introduction to each other was to get completely naked talk about breaking the ice it was definitely the best way
3666359 hu jintao also reiterated chinas stance on the tibet issue
3666360 i believe that under the leadership of the ccp and the state council the people and the army will unite
3666361 our thoughts and condolences go out to the victims and their families in their hour of need

3666363 we are mobilising christian counsellors those who are trained and already have experience especially after beslan and chechnya he added
3666364 and it is now escalating into a political issue as south ossetia declared its independence from both georgia and russia
3666365 i am concerned that international aid might not be allowed to get to the region because of politics
3666366 i also am praying that the authorities can come to a peaceful diplomatic solution to this fighting
3666367 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3666368 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3666369 the use of force in the dispute over south ossetia and abkhazia has cost the precious lives of civilians and soldiers risks destabilising a fragile region and reawakens deep fears there and far beyond

3666375 but she is bright organized and conscientious the type whod get to school to turn in a paper on time even if she were dying of stomach flu
3666376 we learn through experience and we learn through bad experiences through failure we learn how to cope
3666377 parents and schools are no longer geared toward child development theyre geared to academic achievement
3666378 it is interfering with the core mission of the university
3666379 all appointment slots are filled but the students dont stop coming
3666380 there is a ritual every university administrator has come to fear
3666381 every fall parents drop off their well groomed freshmen and within two or three days many have consumed a dangerous amount of alcohol and placed themselves in harms way these kids have been controlled for so long they just go crazy
3666382 much of collegiate social activity is centered on alcohol consumption because its an anxiety reducer and demands no social skills
3666383 plus it provides an instant identity it lets people know that you are willing to belong
3666384 parents have told their kids from day one that theres no end to what they are capable of doing
3666385 they read them the dr seuss book oh the places youll go and create bumper stickers telling the world their child is an honor student american parents today expect their children to be perfect the smartest fastest most charming people in the universe and if they cant get the children to prove it on their own theyll turn to doctors to make their kids into the people that parents want to believe their kids are
3666386 showing kids how to work the system for their own benefit
3666387 i wish my parents had some hobby other than me
3666388 if you have an infant and the baby has gas burping the baby is being a good parent but when you have a 10 year old who has metaphoric gas you dont have to burp him you have to let him sit with it try to figure out what to do about it he then learns to tolerate moderate amounts of difficulty and its not the end of the world
3666389 so many toys now are designed by and for adults
3666390 its normal for children to have curiosity about other childrens genitals
3666391 but when they do most parents i know are totally freaked out they wonder whats wrong
3666392 theyve been told by their coaches where on the field to stand told by their parents what color socks to wear told by the referees whos won and whats fair kids are losing leadership skills
3666393 children arent getting any benefits out of play as they once did
3666394 hi mom i just got an ice cream cone can you believe they put sprinkles on the bottom as well as on top
3666395 theyre not calling their parents to say i really went wild last friday at the frat house and now i might have chlamydia
3666396 but cell phones keep kids from figuring out what to do
3666397 theyve never internalized any images all theyve internalized is call mom or dad
3666398 the first thing students do when they walk out the door of my classroom is flip open the cell phone ninety five percent of the conversations go like this i just got out of class ill see you in the library in five minutes absent the phone youd have to make arrangements ahead of time youd have to think ahead
3666399 children need to be gently encouraged to take risks and learn that nothing terrible happens
3666400 they need gradual exposure to find that the world is not dangerous having overprotective parents is a risk factor for anxiety disorders because children do not have opportunities to master their innate shyness and become more comfortable in the world
3666401 if every drawing is going to end up on your parents refrigerator youre not free to fool around to goof up or make mistakes
3666402 a way of hiding in plain sight they just dont want to be exposed to any more scrutiny
3666403 but when you cheat on their behalf to get them ahead of other children
3666404 if i need every advantage i can get then perhaps there is really something wrong with me
3666405 havent become fully adult yet traditionally defined as finishing school landing a job with benefits marrying and parenting because they are not ready or perhaps not permitted to do so
3666406 they often need a period in college or afterward to legitimately experiment to be children
3666407 theres decent historical evidence to suggest that societies that allow kids a few years of latitude and even moderate rebellion end up with healthier kids than societies that pretend such impulses dont exist
3666408 the precursor to marriage is dating and the precursor to dating is playing
3666409 and many of them project that onto their children when theyre the ones who live or work in a competitive environment they then imagine that their children must be swimming in a big shark tank too
3666410 its hard to know what the world is going to look like 10 years from now
3666411 how best do you prepare kids for that parents think that earlier is better thats a natural intuition but it happens to be wrong
3666412 we have a competitive frenzy that frankly involves parents more than it involves kids themselves
3666413 kids are more ambivalent about the college race than are parents
3666414 and it makes them feel terribly guilty sometimes they arrange to fail to right the scales and when you cheat on their behalf you completely undermine their sense of self esteem they feel they didnt earn it on their own
3666415 exams are a fact of life they are anxiety producing the kids never learn how to cope with anxiety
3666416 parenting has in some measurable ways become less enjoyable than it used to be
3666417 i find parents less willing to indulge their childrens sense of time so they either force feed them or do things for them
3666418 middle class parents especially assume that if kids start getting into difficulty they need to rush in and do it for them rather than let them flounder a bit and learn from it i dont mean we should abandon them
3666419 although teens dont necessarily behave in a competent way they have the potential to be every bit as competent and as incompetent as adults
3666420 the demand for mini notebooks will be driven by several factors including their small form factor and small screen their light weight their price their ease of use and their basic but sufficient pc functionality

3666422 mini notebooks create opportunities to reach some new pc buyers and expand within existing buyers across all regions
3666423 considering the majority of mini notebooks will be sold to consumers pc vendors will need to pay increasing attention to the design and ease of use of mini notebooks these will be two crucial factors in this segment

3666431 an offense report was not written on this situation and an arrest was not made
3666432 however a citation was written and that is not public record under rule 12
3666433 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3666434 the governor i think was looking for what this meant when sen french was making the statements he did
3666435 and we were trying to give her a better idea of what this could possibly mean so were just trying to do a prudent inquiry to cover her options
3666436 i think it is harmful to the credibility of the administration harmful to the process and harmful to all the parties involved
3666437 even before he named an investigator he went to the national media with a fairly serious concept so we began an internal review
3666438 my view is that they are perfectly free to try to ascertain for themselves what happened
3666439 until i learn otherwise im going to assume that its on the up and up
3666440 so the investigator himself actually asked us to do the very type of thing we were doing we were doing it before he asked for it but its not inconsistent
3666441 talking is not all john edwards is interested in when it comes to woman

3666463 golden rule and it appears that todays people in charge have a deep seeded need to restore the responsibility factor and revamp their own character

3666465 i dont know what to say im afraid youve wasted your whole life you are pronouncing the mantra incorrectly

3666472 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards

3666495 its fairly clear that the labor market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than originally thought
3666496 inflation is likely to rise further this year and to peak at around 5 percent in the coming months

3666519 it shouldnt be totally surprising when we hold up tolerance and diversity as the guidepost for public life this is what you end up getting you get congressmen chasing sixteen year old boys down the halls of congress
3666520 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
3666521 for god sent his son into the world not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved

3666525 according to rumors john mccain and barack obama are trying to get angelina jolie s endorsement for the campaign and john edwards is just trying to get her number
3666526 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards
3666527 while after vigorously denying reports of his extramarital affair and calling the story ridiculous untrue and tabloid trash john edwards admitted he had an affair and the national enquirer was the only publication writing about it the national enquirer was the first to break it turns out it was true you know what this means elvis is alive bigfoot is real aliens are here its all true
3666528 i guess edwards apparently met this woman at a new york city bar in 2006 and he is a pretty smooth operator
3666529 no he actually said about the other woman he doesnt love her oh thats smart now youve got two women mad at you great way to go
3666530 well democrats are furious theyre going on record now saying john edwards will not be allowed to speak at the convention because of this affair yeah instead speaking in his place bill clinton you have to put your foot down
3666531 in fact when john mccain heard about the john edwards affair he said well thank god i cant get an erection anymore whew some problems just take care of themselves
3666532 well according to a new study coffee can improve your memory thats what they say drinking coffee improves your memory which is good news for both barack obama and john mccain if we can get them to have some coffee before their first debate maybe they can remember what their original positions were
3666533 and that paris hilton ad about john mccain has gotten over five million hits on the web
3666534 and porn star jenna jameson is pregnant boy that john edwards gets around
3666535 as you know president bush is on a week long tour to asia where he ll visit south korea thailand and china

3666573 going forward wed like to see whether we can introduce these cells into an ischemic myocardium with the idea being that they would form new vessels alleviate the ischemia and possibly help the recovery of the myocardium
3666574 our hypothesis is that youd reestablish a vascular network relatively quickly and that would help the cardiac progenitors that reside there to reform myocardium
3666575 what were doing instead is putting in two cell types and we know exactly what theyre going to do and its more controlled
3666576 i dont want to make it sound like magic but i think that for the endothelial cells thats their job to do this
3666577 the mpcs can differentiate into bone or fat and some other lineages but we show that in the presence of epcs theyll form smooth muscle cells which are the outer layer of the blood vessel and very important for stability of the vessel and for larger arteries contraction
3666578 we can isolate a much higher number of epcs from cord blood than adult blood and theres been some discussion that adult blood epcs are so few so rare that you wont be able to grow enough for this to be useful or that somehow they are older cells that arent going to have the same robust capacity
3666579 but in the last experiment in our paper we compared adult epcs side by side with cord blood epcs in this model and compared their ability to form blood vessels and they were the same so theres hope for all kinds of people
3666580 if you have a traumatic injury or heart attack you need these new vessels right away so there are still some big obstacles
3666581 the cells are there we can grow them and i think as we move forward we can really optimize and improve how we do this
3666582 one of the big questions that are being asked right now by many people outside of cardiology by policy makers by payers by people in other areas of medicine is what is the value of cv imaging
3666583 there has been a dramatic increase in the utilization of imaging over the past 10 to 15 years but we dont know to what extent cv imaging results in improvement in patient outcomes the reason we went into medicine was because we wanted to help people and therefore everything we do in medicine should be because we want to help people because we want to make a difference the imaging technology today is amazing its amazing how quickly its advanced yet we havent answered the fundamental question of whether were actually helping people by doing this
3666584 the traditional way is to look at sensitivity specificity and accuracy and this is really an opportunity to take those technical and performance characteristics and put them in the context of answering a clinical question
3666585 were now maturing the science and the field to the point where were able to get past that technical information and onto the clinical information to test a diagnostic strategy thats a huge paradigm shift
3666586 the specific goal was to say lets have a conversation about raising the level of research in imaging so that were now testing the ability of imaging to improve outcomes as to the actual specifics of what we discussed were not ready to talk about any of that yet this is a work in progress
3666587 the core imaging technologies that are in need of either outcomes studies themselves or comparative studies
3666588 the goal was to try to define in broad terms a number of clinical trials that would be feasible and would improve our knowledge base with respect to outcomes and to go from there to actually considering those further in more specific detail so they can be considered for funding within various funding mechanisms
3666589 in no way was there any commitment to fund anything or a choice made about what would be funded it was very much a think tank approach to saying okay we need imaging outcomes data and theres a variety of domains in which we need imaging outcomes data
3666590 the outgrowth of this type of workshop is usually a request for proposals for somebody to perform research thats not 100 certain but usually there is some decision made that something is important and that research is the next step there was a lot of enthusiasm about possible ways to examine diagnostic strategies in different patient groups and its now up to nhlbi to decide what they want to do with those ideas and hopefully they will be able to fund some really nice research
3666591 they could say we really want to understand the role of imaging in screening asymptomatic patients or when a patient presents to the emergency room with chest pain or when a patient presents to a physicians office with chest pain or in a heart failure patient with known coronary artery disease what does imaging add those were really the four patient scenarios we talked about and there were discussions of trials that would be very important to do in all of those areas i dont know coming out of this which one or several nih will go with
3666592 this was a group that was all of like mind that these sorts of imaging trials are pivotal at this moment and that we need to move forward to make sure that theres a return on investment for imaging
3666593 so there was the recognition that imaging is growing were spending more on imaging and its growing disproportionate to other healthcare costs
3666594 and while that might be because were delivering better care its not a straightforward connection that more imaging improves outcomes that hasnt been demonstrated i think everyone realizes that the funding crisis for imaging cant be ignored and that we cant just stick our heads in the sand and think that we have certain beliefs about imaging and its relationship with outcomes we have to demonstrate it
3666595 a lot of the emphasis in pharmacogenomics has been on identifying drugs that produce a particular efficacy but i think these findings suggest that much greater emphasis on safety could be more fruitful
3666596 it might well be that there are just a few pathways that result in these big increases in rare but serious side effects in particular individuals
3666597 the identification of such variants is expected to improve the management of patient care by determining which patients should take a specific drug and which patients should take a modified dose of the drug
3666598 this strategy could potentially reduce medical costs and improve the process of drug development
3666599 the dose where we start to see myopathy varies from statin to statin but with simvastatin 40 mg per day the rate of myopathy is around 1 10 000 per annum
3666600 but if you push the dose up from 40 mg to 80 mg the rate increases to about 1 1000 per annum about a 10 fold increase with the other statins there will be a point in which doubling of the dose will produce be a big increase in myopathy
3666601 i think if your myopathy risk is low say with a standard dose of a statin there probably isnt much point in screening
3666602 but for a patient where a doctor is thinking about a higher dose of a statin because the patient is at higher risk of heart attack or stroke and they are trying to lower their ldl cholesterol as much as possible to lower that risk then it might be worthwhile genotyping to be reassured the myopathy risk would not be particularly high or to be aware that the patient might be at risk if they were homozygous for the variant you might decide not to use a high dose statin but instead go with a combination of different lipid lowering agents
3666603 the result is that many studies have lacked sufficient statistical power

3666613 only one study of bariatric surgery actually had data on cardiovascular events at follow up so for the others we had to estimate event rates using well accepted formulas such as framingham and procam risk scores we calculated the predicted risk of cardiovascular events based on risk factor measurements before and after surgery
3666614 in light of the paucity of studies examining cardiovascular outcomes after bariatric surgery we believe that this study will allow initial generalizability of using bariatric surgery as a means to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
3666615 i think this is very compelling data while it is not proof that surgery reduces cardiovascular events it is highly suggestive and therefore very encouraging
3666616 cardiovascular events are the most common cause of death in patients who are morbidly obese but still the decision to undergo surgery must be made on an individual basis for example a middle aged obese patient who has many other risk factors such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure would have more to gain than a younger obese patient with normal cholesterol and blood pressure i would say that while the current study is not definitive its results could still be taken into account when weighing the pros and cons of surgery

3666642 a number of observational studies have implicated sleep apnea as being associated with an increased risk of mi and chf but whether sleep apnea is a definitive cause of mi we still need to prove we believe that it is sleep apnea that is causing these patients to have an mi at night but whether it is just changing the timing of an mi that is going to happen anyway or is fundamentally increasing the risk of mi independent of other factors we cannot yet say for sure but i would advise that patients who have suffered an mi at night be investigated for sleep apnea and if they are found to have the condition that it be treated and this may lower their risk of having another mi in the future
3666643 our findings identify obstructive sleep apnea as the first disease condition recognized to actually reverse the usual day night variation in the incidence of mi
3666644 our findings suggest that the pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea leads to an increased risk of mi during the night
3666645 what is very consistent in all studies is that patients with sleep apnea experience significant physiologic stress at night low oxygen levels activate the sympathetic nervous system which thus causes a significant rise in blood pressure and the patient is therefore exposed to a significant level of simultaneous problems in addition patients with sleep apnea show nighttime changes on their ecg that suggest the heart is not getting enough blood this is what made us look at the possibility that these people may be having mis at night i would say that it is likely that sleep apnea could be causing these nighttime mis but we have not proven that it actually is the cause but i would still advise anyone who has had an mi during the night to get checked out for sleep apnea
3666646 the biggest drawback is that there are not enough data out there at present we are trying to identify the mechanisms of mi at night to find out exactly what happens to these patients but we also need more studies to investigate whether sleep apnea therapy such as continuous positive airway pressure can prevent nocturnal cardiac events

3666649 i dont think we could recommend routine stress tests for patients with chd until theres a study that shows it improves outcomes compared with current practice however our study suggests that symptom guided management of coronary disease may be inadequate
3666650 our results suggest that the presence of inducible ischemia is a stronger predictor of adverse events than self reported angina and more than 80 of patients with inducible ischemia may not report the presence of weekly or more frequent angina
3666651 our findings suggest that further study of the potential benefit of routine stress testing in outpatients with stable chd regardless of angina symptoms may be warranted
3666652 i dont think the guidelines on how best to use stress testing should be changed until we have more data although our study suggests that this is clearly a question that needs further study
3666653 thus a randomized trial would be required to evaluate whether a strategy of routine stress testing improves patient outcomes
3666654 nico sailed really well on the first two legs on the first i was close to him when he managed to get away i was tired and he still had the willpower and clear mindedness to try anything to go and search and grab the opportunities this does not come down to good luck this comes down to pure talent
3666655 i believe in myself and my strategy and not necessarily just intuition i try and see the long term situation when it works out it is a bit like a spiral and that is were i do well i am also confident in my ability which has just grown over the years
3666656 even though i came to win i still feel i have had a great solitaire
3666657 it all came down to the first leg when nicolas troussel pretty much killed the race he has sailed brilliantly i have finished 3rd so many times so finishing 2nd it great now i have to come back next year to win it
3666658 it is funny nicolas troussel wins the first leg and overall gildas morvan wins the second leg and is second overall and i win the third leg and am third overall we have had to work hard but then what is really self assuring is that i have been very regular and finished on the podium on all the legs i think that i have become more of an all rounder and more consistent
3666659 i was expecting lots of things but then none of them where what i actually experienced you have to do this race to understand it i found out lots of things about myself about what drives me to want to win about what i am good at i tried to keep going the whole way the only little fright i had was on the second leg when i crossed paths with whale and we missed colliding by just a couple of centimetres on the third leg i went hell for leather it was a real sprint and even broke things on the boat i thought i was going to enjoy it and i just loved it
3666660 we have had two legs where low pressure systems have meant we could not sail the planned courses but then we just have to adapt
3666661 i am so happy now to see all the boats safely back and think that everyone is pleased now and when you see the level of these competitors you understand why this solitaire has such a high standard
3666662 it is no fluke that you see these very talented and experienced sailors on top of the podium i am also truly surprised by the rookies the first three are of extraordinary ability fran ois gabart adrien hardy and isabelle joschke but then they are good sailors who train hard and perform well all year long
3666663 the potential for benefit is great when the baseline intake is low
3666664 in countries where people eat very little fish and some of these countries have almost no sources of omega 3 fatty acids because they cook with corn or sunflower oils the consumption of vegetable oils with ala could have a major impact on heart disease
3666665 if ala were able to do the same heavy lifting that eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha do this would be welcomed news because the capacity to produce ala is essentially limitless whereas there are only so many fish in the sea
3666666 we see a dose effect but only up to about 0 7 of adipose tissue which corresponds to about 1 8 g day increasing intake further was not associated with increased protection this is why we hypothesized that if we were to conduct a study in a population already within this range youre not likely to see an effect
3666667 for individuals who are eating fish as a method to control inflammatory diseases such as heart disease it is clear from these numbers that tilapia is not a good choice
3666668 taken together these data reveal that marked changes in the fishing industry during the past decade have produced widely eaten fish that have fatty acid characteristics that are generally accepted to be inflammatory by the healthcare community
3666669 we have known for three decades that arachidonic acid is the substrate for all proinflammatory lipid mediators animal studies say unequivocally that if you feed arachidonic acid the animals show signs of inflammation and get sick
3666670 cardiologists are telling their patients to go home and eat fish and if the patients are poor theyre eating tilapia and that could translate into a dangerous situation

3666678 gt the future of cardiometabolic risk what lies ahead for your patients
3666679 this drug does not have sufficient evidence for it to be used as a front line agent
3666680 statins are the drugs of choice the evidence is not even strong enough to say that people who cannot tolerate statins should go on it it is an option right now using it is based on an assumption that you know what
3666681 there are people saying that there is no clinical trial evidence showing that vytorin does anything on atherosclerotic events
3666682 now we have a secondary end point which is important to recognize but its a prespecified end point and the drug has a statistically significant benefit on ischemic events thats really the story in my opinion
3666683 thats actually less relative risk protection than was seen in 4s and the heart protection study studies using similar doses of simvastatin but with less ldl reduction
3666684 although the study didnt provide evidence of benefit on the aortic valve i think it does provide good evidence that you get quite a worthwhile absolute reduction in ischemic events almost 5 in a population that is currently not being treated with statins
3666685 in this area the evidence is so strong that successfully altering lipids produces benefit
3666686 my perspective is not so black and white but medicine is an art and we have to practice medicine on the basis of the best evidence we have would you rather leave a patients ldl cholesterol above the national guideline targets because there arent clinical end point data
3666687 ldl lowering decreases the risk of cardiovascular events and that has been shown consistently when you look at the totality of evidence
3666688 it is important not to look at trials in isolation
3666689 the fact that some of the leading cardiologists are involved in improve it tells you that they are comfortable in saying that we truly do not know the effect of this drug on patient outcomes and the only way to find out is to monitor risk and benefit in a trial
3666690 any patient using the drug should understand where we stand with respect to the evidence and the uncertainty about the drug
3666691 it might be due to chance but it still needs due consideration
3666692 this is a whole different kettle of fish than what are the effects of lipid lowering on atherosclerosis
3666693 investigators came up with the question asking whether there might be a relationship between lipid altering interventions and slowing the progression of aortic valve disease and the answer to that is no
3666694 the time is ripe for the lipid lowering hypothesis for halting progression of calcific aortic valve stenoses to be abandoned
3666695 as a general rule when primary outcomes fail to meet statistical verdicts analyses of secondary outcomes should be interpreted with caution
3666696 this applies equally to the ischemic composite end point which showed a 20 reduction with vytorin and to the 50 increased cancer risk associated with vytorin nonetheless the signal for increased cancer rate is concerning and merits careful scrutiny interim analyses of ongoing studies to refute or corroborate findings observed in other clinical trials are a slippery slope
3666697 in a clinical trial the cholesterol lowering drug vytorin did not help people with heart valve disease avoid further heart problems but did appear to increase their risk of cancer
3666698 it is never good to see a drug associated with a 50 increased risk of cancer
3666699 i dont think theres anything very surprising here but i guess what is novel is that the findings relate to a population that has not been studied much if at all in this regard
3666700 and i think that the message is one that has public health implications for everybody else this is basically a reiteration of the fact that smoking is a very potent cardiovascular risk factor and i think the indoctrination that most of us have received about the ills of smoking have clearly not penetrated the alaska eskimo population
3666701 this population traditionally has had a diet high in omega 3s so i think this is reflects a shift in the diet or that the beneficial effects of an omega 3 rich diet have been negated by the smoking and also a change toward a more sedentary lifestyle
3666702 i think there probably will be some genetic component in the same way that there is likely a genetic component to almost anything once you have the tools to look carefully
3666703 but even if there is a genetic component that would not be the most likely explanation for the recent increase in both clinical and now using carotid ultrasound subclinical atherosclerosis that were seeing the genes have been there for millennia whats different now is the smoking
3666704 the lesson for anybody is that the traditional risk factors can be very potent and should be the focus of prevention and general improvement of public health its a very simple lesson but something that this just proves once again

3666707 are encouraging because they provide evidence that high lp a levels in a high risk setting might be appropriate to consider an intensified intervention however further studies are needed to firmly assess any possible therapeutic benefits of a reduction of lp a levels
3666708 several recent one year dietary studies have led the american diabetes association to state in january 2008 that low carb diets should be considered for a maximum of one year
3666709 the current two year study suggests that one low fat diet doesnt fit all meaning that the old paradigm should be reconsidered
3666710 the current results suggest that mediterranean and low carbohydrate diets are effective alternatives to low fat diets
3666711 the more favorable effects on lipids with the low carbohydrate diet and on glycemic control with the mediterranean diet suggest that personal preferences and metabolic considerations might inform individualized tailoring of dietary interventions
3666712 we took advantage of the isolated place which is highly monitored by an excellent internal medical department and a set of cafeterias whose menus we could modify
3666713 we do believe that this optimal model could be applied in other workplaces once the manager prioritizes this kind of long term health promotion project
3666714 first the advantage of this strategy is that the enemy carbohydrates is well defined and once learning it the dieter knows what to stay away from without counting calories
3666715 and after the initiation phase the dieter has less craving second we assume that a relatively high protein diet does contribute to higher satiety third the immediate response of the body to weight loss may encourage the dieter
3666716 there is this study and there are two additional national institutes of health studies in the us that are progressing well so i dont know what the push back was some have speculated that dr robert c atkins dying or the company going bankrupt made the wind change even though the science has just marched along its a mystery to me
3666717 im reading my daughters high school health textbook and its like a religion everyone should follow a low fat diet and saturated fats kill you and thats just wrong plain wrong
3666718 there are more people coming out of the closet saying they werent part of this low fat diet thing all along but i guess they felt they couldnt speak up i think that what were soon going to find is that nobodys going to be defending the 30 fat low fat diet anymore
3666719 the aha updated its dietary guidelines in 2005 which are quite different from the diet thats quoted here
3666720 the dietary fat restriction at 30 of calories is no longer part of the aha guidelines and the saturated fat content has been reduced from 10 to 7 and the cholesterol content from 300 to 200 mg day i think its a little bit unfair to kind of generalize that the aha number one stands for a low fat diet thats no longer the case and number two there is some kind of mysterious benefit of being on the mediterranean and low carb diets over time that doesnt necessarily at this point have any explanation
3666721 anything that would endorse the atkins type of food intake pattern would not be something that the aha would back
3666722 saturated fats raise ldl cholesterol i dont think many people would disagree with that at this point limiting saturated fats is still a position the aha would claim and i think thats consistent with the national cholesterol education program guidelines the american diabetes association the us department of agriculture i dont think there is any major professional organization at this point thats willing to throw in the towel on saturated fats and say they are unimportant
3666723 how generalizable this study is to women with obesity is not clear to me
3666724 low fat diets work but the low carb and mediterranean diets are stronger and thats good because we need more tools all this my diet is better than your diet we need to get beyond that what we really want are the metabolic outcomes and there are many ways to go about it
3666725 its time to study low fat and high fat diets with cardiac end points and genetic markers to tailor diets for cardiac risk reduction
3666726 until we have studies that show me that heart attacks cancer or other comorbidities of obesity are reduced in terms of hard end points im not going to be convinced that any diet is better even though you may be down a few more kilograms on that one diet
3666727 im not denying the success of shai et als study im just saying that this is more hand waving with soft outcomes which really dont get at the question can people lose weight for five 10 15 and 20 years and what does that do to risk for heart disease stroke and mortality

3666730 the death rate from coronary heart disease in japan has always been puzzlingly low our study suggests that the very low rates of coronary heart disease among japanese living in japan may be due to their lifelong high consumption of fish

3666732 our findings indicate that the antiatherogenic effect of marine derived omega 3 fatty acids is likely to be present only in populations with fish intake well above those of most western populations it thus appears unlikely that short term supplementation in a low fish intake population would show such a relationship
3666733 if the high intake of marine derived omega 3 fatty acids in japanese men is the primary reason for their extremely low chd mortality in the face of high traditional cardiovascular risk factors dietary interventions to increase marine derived omega 3 fatty acids in the us and other countries where fish intake is not as high as in japan could have a very substantial impact on chd
3666734 this unexpected finding has stimulated the search for a factor or factors in the japanese diet or lifestyle that have the power to withstand the onslaught of advancing risk factors
3666735 the japanese experience when contrasted to that of the inuit and the norwegians suggests that the cardioprotective punch of the long chain omega 3 fatty acids may be no match for diets high in fat particularly saturated fat
3666736 these findings suggest the not unreasonable hypothesis that decades of a moderately high omega 3 dietary intake may be the best way to slow atherosclerosis the observations of sekikawa et al harmonize with this view and strongly suggest that the japanese factor is likely to be omega 3 fatty acids

3666738 we show that comprehensive smoke free laws significantly reduce exposure to secondhand smoke which has been associated with undesirable health outcomes
3666739 and based on that evidence certain conclusions have been made
3666740 studies suggest that smoke free workplace policies are followed by a 10 to 20 decrease in hospital admissions for acute coronary events in the first year after implementation of a smoking ban
3666741 there is strong evidence suggesting that the introduction of a smoke free legislation decreases heart disease morbidity
3666742 sufficient evidence that the introduction of smoke free policies decreases respiratory symptoms in workers they note
3666743 in view of the long lag time between secondhand smoke exposure and the development of lung cancer data are not yet available regarding the expected decline in lung cancer after implementation of smoke free policies

3666747 for the existing products the companies are largely on track because we just approved a labeling change that came with postmarketing requirements and they are actually engaged in doing them now
3666748 i think the intention of the fda was that with several imaging agents expected to come before them they felt that starting out this way would allow everyone to hear what the issues are without targeting a particular development program and then when a particular program comes forward the issues will already be on the table
3666749 just making a better image wasnt good enough and that it would like to see a better image lead to a better outcome
3666750 we toyed with the idea that maybe it doesnt have to be that a better image leads to lower mortality but that a better image might lead to a better strategy with cardiac ultrasound maybe that strategy is better utilization of cardiac catheterization
3666751 that would be an example of an outcome we might ask a development program to achieve
3666752 there have been calls for cardiovascular outcome trials on diabetes drugs but it was unclear to the fda what exactly this meant
3666753 we are assuming that a drug biologic with a safety signal in phase 2 3 trials will have to have an additional safety trial but for those drugs without such a signal should there be a requirement to conduct a long term trial or provide equivalent evidence to rule out an unacceptable cardiovascular risk
3666754 i think we have consensus that we need either one large trial or a series of smaller trials to give information on cardiovascular risk we dont need to show cardiovascular benefit given that these drugs already have a benefit in lowering blood glucose levels which is known to be associated with a reduction in microvascular complications but we do need to show lack of hazard
3666755 in my view it is not possible to specify one size or duration of trial for all drugs this would depend on what adverse events had already shown up in the development program and what other benefits the new drug was offering
3666756 we need to try to ensure that if a drug has a favorable effect on ldl we want that to show up and that wont happen if all patients have their ldl treated to target
3666757 this would provide more reliable preapproval data but only delay approval by a few months and would also ensure that solid data would be generated for all new drugs
3666758 only 14 of phase 4 commitments actually get done that is one of the things that went wrong with rosiglitazone they never conducted the trial that they had committed to at the time of approval i think we have to learn from those mistakes
3666759 once you take a look you have affected the behavior in the trial and my own view is that is not desirable
3666760 if the preapproval trial suggested benefit that trial will still have very wide confidence intervals because it will not be big enough to show a definitive result it will simply reduce the uncertainty and if you really want to do this correctly you have to nail down the full answer in a large outcomes trial
3666761 i dont feel we as a panel should specify any specific upper boundary i would rather see a clinical assessment of risk whatever the statistical bound of a trial is my interpretation of that trial will be determined by other things the point estimate the number of events whether there are other signals of concern the incremental value of the drug if the drug can achieve better glycemic control with reduced risk of hypoglycemia i may be more accepting of a higher upper boundary on cardiovascular risk and this may be different for a completely new class of drug rather than another drug in an established class
3666762 we need to go back internally and think about the advice in more detail we have clearly heard that we need better information on the cardiovascular safety of diabetes drugs before approval the fda already has to decide whether the safety database of a drug in the approval application is sufficient to rule out harm but the committee is now recommending that we should have more data to do this and that an unacceptably high risk needs to be ruled out before approval this approach could also well be applied to drugs in other classes such as the nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids
3666763 we will have to go back and look at each individual drug and the amount of evidence available to see if it is adequate or not to ensure cardiovascular safety if not we may have to ask for more data
3666764 the seas study has given a clear cut answer to the question of whether intensive lipid lowering will influence the course of aortic stenosis disease i think we can conclude that it does not
3666765 we have also shown there is benefit in treating such patients with the study drug combination as we saw a reduction in the risk of coronary artery disease
3666766 the studies do not confirm the hypothesis that treatment with this combination increases the overall risk of developing cancer
3666767 im very pleased with the fact that intense cholesterol lowering reduces coronary events in patients with aortic stenosis a group of patients in whom ive had a longstanding interest
3666768 we have a green light to continue the improve it trial we think thats a really important trial sort of the center of a of coronary disease
3666769 for decades the medical community has accepted that aortic valve disease was part of the aging process and that replacing valves surgically was the only treatment
3666770 now we have clinical evidence showing a medical treatment can delay the need for surgery i see a lot of patients in their 50s being diagnosed with early stage valve disease that dont like hearing that the next step is watchful waiting until eventually theyll require open heart surgery for them this is great news
3666771 the seas study has given a clear cut answer to the question of whether intensive lipid lowering will influence the course of aortic stenosis disease i think we can conclude that it does not

3666773 together these findings strongly suggest that 25 hydroxyvitamin d has beneficial effects some involving the cardiovascular system that are independent of calcium metabolism
3666774 low 25 hydroxyvitamin d and 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin d levels seem to be important mediators of mortality even when there is little or no indication of overt vascular disease
3666775 this prospective cohort study demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge that low 25 hydroxyvitamin d and 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin d levels are associated with increased risk in all cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with patients with higher serum vitamin d levels both vitamins seem to have synergistic biologic action that is largely independent of each other based on the findings of this study a serum 25 hydroxyvitamin d level of 20 ng ml or higher may be advised for maintaining general health
3666776 the largest cohort with the longest follow up of patients with myocardial bridging in the medical literature
3666777 if you treat them with nitrates which physicians would typically prescribe it worsens their symptoms because it worsens the systolic constriction of the bridge segment
3666778 beta blockers reduce the systolic compression and prolong the duration of the diastolic phase and that way improve perfusion and reduce ischemia
3666779 these patients should be treated with beta blockers whether or not there are significant symptoms or objective ischemia
3666780 if someone is really refractory to beta blockers or calcium antagonists or in a few cases to the combination of both
3666781 then stenting should be considered if there is clear evidence for myocardial ischemia or significantly altered hemodynamics that could be potentially harmful
3666782 stenting would not be the first choice but in some patients thats the only way to avoid ischemia reduce symptoms and reduce risk from the bridges keeping in mind that the majority of patients with myocardial bridging do not need any treatment if they are considered as class a
3666783 oncologists and cardiologists are coming at the same problem from opposite ends
3666784 we may be starting to understand the challenge this presents
3666785 given the profound effect of removing hedgehog signaling from the myocardium caution should be taken in the development of these pharmaceuticals
3666786 it is possible that therapeutic effects of hedgehog antagonists may be achieved at levels of inhibition that do not impair cardiac function
3666787 we gave mice small amounts of antibodies against hedgehog and in those that had a recent myocardial infarction this led to poorer heart function and some lethality
3666788 this finding should serve as a warning that these drugs might have adverse effects
3666789 reemphasizes the need for prevention of cardiovascular disease by following dietary guidelines for americans and increasing physical activity and also includes a review of the pharmacologic agents and indications for treating dyslipidemia in children
3666790 more data are now available on the safety and efficiency of pharmacologic agents used to treat dyslipidemia most of these data were not available at the time of the previous statement
3666791 this is the first time theres been any statement on these two noninvasive imaging modalities
3666792 this is intended to be an assessment of where we are with the technology the basis for using it its potential and what we need to think about going forward
3666793 we discouraged the use of cta in low risk patients because theyre not going to have any significant coronary disease
3666794 youd have to screen too many people exposing so many people to contrast and radiation
3666795 the other scenario we felt strongly about is the opposite scenario where someone is high risk they have all those markers for cvd they come in with symptoms and you know they have cad in those cases the current standard is to do an angiogram because theres a reasonable likelihood that some of that disease is treatable and theyd go directly to intervention so were saying dont expose the patient to additional contrast and radiation with cta it doesnt add anything to their care
3666796 we wanted to emphasize that there are alternatives to cta and invasive angiography for these indications
3666797 people dont always have to get radiation and iodine and the most obvious of those exceptions right now are the coronary anomalies and the congenital coronary disease mra should be considered in those circumstances
3666798 that makes sense if you have a very novel technology the first step is to have people try this technology in all sorts of ways so what the statement asks is based on all these individual single center experiences what do we glean in total weve tried to come to conclusions about using coronary cta or coronary mra that will be most beneficial to patient care in the long run
3666799 hospitals regulators and manufacturers certainly have some immediate work to do hospitals should consider internal surveillance especially in critical care units for emi problems that staff have heretofore not noticed or reported regulatory agencies should determine if new and specific guidance on the safety of the relevant equipment is warranted manufacturers need to assess emi interactions with equipment other than their own and seek mitigating designs such as better shielding for both current and future products
3666800 this is a case study of the beast inevitably hidden in every technology sometimes it purrs and sometimes it bites
3666801 in the end the battle for high safety and reliability in healthcare is never won
3666802 safety is not a condition it is a process it can emerge continually only in a culture that is alert cooperative transparent and resilient when the unexpected happens as it always will
3666803 the main point of the statement is that we need to place more emphasis on population based and preventive approaches than we have to date
3666804 this point has been made in different ways before in different kinds of documents and its being made globally but we are still in the process of educating health professionals about what this actually means and why its needed its inefficient to put all your eggs in the basket of screening and treating the individual
3666805 it turns out when we look at all the other statements this is a missing piece
3666806 this statement is really putting the story of prevention together and pointing out that any prevention approach we take in any population still needs to be on a better platform
3666807 in a way its like the tobacco scenario when people realized there were some broad policies that could be made that would change the options that people had
3666808 with food its trickier because food is not inherently harmful so its a much more complicated task were not trying to turn people against food were not trying to put the food industry out of business where would we be if we did that but were trying to say that weve got to think more carefully about the health effects of a lot of the decisions we make about transportation about community design about food about the school day about what happens at a work site thats the point about the comprehensive approach weve got to go into the population and make it just easier for people to bump into the right choices
3666809 this statement is about putting the information in one place and telling people who don t think its their business that the level of advocacy and awareness we need also applies to them we cant afford to have anyone working on cardiovascular disease who if asked by the person next to them on the golf course or next to them in the hospital doesnt really get it that obesity is not just a bunch of people who overindulge
3666810 ive had cardiologist colleagues joke with me in the cafeteria line when theyve got a pile of fried onion rings on their tray and they say oh dont worry well get them in the cath lab
3666811 we cant afford to have the people who are involved in treatment think thats the only solution they also have to convince people to do things that are a lot harder because theyre getting right to the heart of how people live theyre getting into vested interests and theres not necessarily a profit motive but cardiologists are very very authoritative and influential people people will ask their cardiologist for an opinion and we want them to know what they should say
3666812 there was a time when people thought it wasnt possible to change the type of fat people eat or that you couldnt change smoking habits
3666813 so you have to start somewhere with that conversation to begin to shift the expectation that these things cant be changed there are people who are out there working on the ground with community coalitions fighting for this and physicians need to help reinforce what those people are doing by lending their authority and helping to support their message
3666814 there is a lot of grassroots activity there is stuff going on all over the country with people taking on planning commissions school boards and advertisers so this is actually happening its a social movement and we want cardiologists to know about it and put their weight behind it
3666815 you really dont think that guy is going to do any of that crap do you

3666821 it does raise the question about whether or not imt is a reliable surrogate end point for clinical events either were not studying the right patient population or the technique is not consistent with clinical events
3666822 to say that this study reflects on enhance in any way is a huge stretch of the imagination

3666826 this is where people get confused they want to say that enhance was weak and flawed and so we should go back to prescribing it with abandon but the study changed practice because it made us realize that the exuberance for the drug had far outreached the evidence to support it
3666827 we simply do not have evidence of its clinical benefit and should be cautious with it until we know what it does i wish it were as simple as seeing what a drug does to ldl but unfortunately it is not

3666835 right now our healthcare system is set up to provide care in small episodes either youre in the hospital or not or in the clinic or not and thats not a patient centered healthcare model
3666836 we have such advanced care for the acute event maybe the next phase of real quality improvement that will make a real difference to patients quality of life and how long they live is to focus on having an effective transition home and handoff to the primary care providers over the following year

3666838 gt optimising outcomes in acute coronary syndromes role of new approaches to platelet inhibition 5 comments jun 3 2008 14 22 edt balancing antithrombotic efficacy with risk of bleeding join our international panel of experts
3666839 these data suggest that future guidelines should favor the use of non hdl cholesterol or apolipoprotein b instead of ldl cholesterol as the primary treatment target especially because targets are currently adjusted downward to very low ldl cholesterol levels
3666840 when you use ldl cholesterol you dont take into account the intermediate density particles things that have more triglycerides in them but still have a lot of cholesterol
3666841 these might not be an issue for people with very elevated ldl cholesterol levels but there are subgroups with borderline ldl levels and high triglycerides and these people might be carrying around the intermediate particles where while they dont contain as much cholesterol they still have the potential to get caught in the walls of blood vessels and cause atherosclerosis
3666842 once you say that non hdl is probably a preferable measurement because all you have to do is measure total cholesterol and hdl cholesterol and subtracting the hdl cholesterol from total cholesterol you have a very good indication of cardiovascular risk

3666844 gt the future of cardiometabolic risk what lies ahead for your patients
3666845 and this is probably genetic although we dont yet fully understand all the reasons
3666846 is a large number because when we have previously looked at variations in genes affecting cholesterol metabolism we can usually only explain no more than 1 to 2 of the variability in statin response
3666847 while a big piece of the puzzle is still not enough of a predictive value to make this a test we would recommend
3666848 the general area of pharmacogenetics in cardiology is an evolving field that is going to require filling in a lot of blanks its not going to be single features that are going to be sufficient
3666849 our findings point to a major role of hmgcr alternative splicing in influencing cholesterol response to statin treatment and exemplify how alternative splicing can act as a modifier of drug response
3666850 but its a big piece of it in the past weve had no more than 1 to 2 of the variability in response to statins explained by any given gene
3666851 and we have reasonable evidence that this is also related to the splicing phenomenon this is something that could help us understand one of the mechanisms by which genes affect blood cholesterol levels in the population
3666852 could wind up increasing the efficacy of statins by 10 to 20 or more

3666855 the use of coronary artery calcium scoring is an effective risk stratification tool in the elderly as well as young patients rendering cac of potential utility even in high risk patients such as those with diabetes those with renal failure smokers and now the elderly
3666856 this study closes the loop around the high risk patients
3666857 its a long held belief that calcium accumulation in the arteries is an age related phenomenon
3666858 this is true but its a gross oversimplification its like saying all diabetic patients are the same we know thats not the case
3666859 coronary calcium screening basically allows us to rebalance or recalibrate our risk assessment tools

3666862 although previous consensus statements indicated that cac score and imt are global atherosclerosis measures and either might be used clinically for refinement of cvd risk assessment our data suggest that in asymptomatic 45 to 84 year old us adults cac score may be the better choice over imt
3666863 the shape taskforce didnt discriminate between which test should be offered
3666864 in practice people are not necessarily picking one test or the other theyre just going with their favorite if a person is particularly interested in coronary disease theyd probably pick cac scanning if its available to them carotid imt is another option and given the shape guidelines we thought it was worthwhile to see which one might actually be better
3666865 there youre actually looking at the vessel that might be most relevant to stroke whereas if someone has a strong history of coronary disease a cac test might be more relevant
3666866 i would say that if a physician feels a test is warranted to help understand how to treat or prevent cvd particularly in that intermediate risk group the cac test seems to be better than the carotid imt for middle aged persons
3666867 several consensus panels and position statements have suggested that both of these modalities are options as an adjunct to cv risk assessment but neither one has been recommended over the other
3666868 clinicians are left with some uncertainty of the relative value of these two tests
3666869 since the participants and physicians were given the results of the cac scores it is probable that physicians were more likely to push patients on the presence of symptoms and to pursue stress testing in those with higher cac scores also known as detection bias
3666870 clinicians are in general less familiar with cimt scores and may not have been as inclined to act on them especially since they were not directly measuring coronary atherosclerosis
3666871 so one standard deviation of cac is not exactly proportional to one standard deviation of cimt
3666872 the categorical analyses that were presented are helpful but cimt values will have less of a rightward skew than cac scores so the cac scores will have more extreme values that influence the results
3666873 its likely that cac scanning is a better predictor of cv events than cimt as demonstrated by the mesa investigators cimt by involves precise measurement of very small values which are more prone to error this noise in the measurement hampers cimt testing relative to cac scanning as more events accrue it will be important for the mesa investigators to revisit this question with long term results and to also examine just hard cv end points

3666920 we tfg did not attack but how many sides did they islamic courts attack baidoa from
3666921 the government has the right to self defense the other group islamic courts had foreigners terrorists of all colors among them
3666922 they islamic courts began attacking the government and its allies and in kismayo the government was overthrown
3666923 the government is ready for reconciliation for power sharing because we divided it the government by clans and the opposition includes all somali clans
3666924 people with self interests are saying that i am against reconciliation

3666940 my view is that the president should just take the position right now that these moratoriums will end on september the 30 th and the democrats have to be responsible for putting them back in
3666941 with all due respect president bush would have to sign the moratorium into law for it to exist
3666942 so if a bill passes congress that has that moratorium your belief is president bush your advice to him is mr president veto that bill
3666943 and my advice to him today would be to start the process up right now for what we do on oct 1 when this moratorium is ended and move forward assuming that there will be no moratorium after september the 30 th
3666944 you would tell him to instruct those people in the interior department who are responsible for administering these leases for the offshore oil and the shale oil to begin the process of getting ready so that on oct 1 he can sell a lease
3666945 and you would go ahead and sell those leases you would say lets do it lets move ahead

3666953 with the u s drowning in health care costs which are projected to top a whopping 4 trillion by 2015 and with three quarters of current spending being squandered on chronic conditions that are largely preventable its no secret that employers and insurance companies see corporate wellness programs as a lifesaver that could keep them afloat
3666954 we hypothesize employees who participate in wellness programs may see them as a lifesaver as well which may give them a heightened perception their companies care about their personal well being making them feel better about their workplace
3666955 in our experience we know its essential to address key human realities and take a whole brained approach to solving the challenge of engaging employees in wellness programs
3666956 this approach encompasses focus repetition and feedback which we know are necessary to train the brain to create new behaviors and habits
3666957 we also know its critical to offer rewards at key points during the program not just at the launch
3666958 those rewards must stir the imagination encourage goal setting allow reinforcement repetition and create lasting goodwill and behaviors

3666983 after the staging step oncologists often monitor a patients cancer treatment for effectiveness or reappearance of a tumor
3666984 for many tumors pet scans are only a slightly more effective diagnostic tool in terms of sensitivity and specificity than ct scans or mris
3666985 so their use is being researched to discover if and how much they may improve patient outcomes
3666986 we hope that we will not have to confront a medical crisis or emergency with our parents

3666991 we are very excited to partner with dtra and share its mission to reduce the threat of biological warfare and bioterrorism
3666992 we believe this government contract further validates the potential of cethromycin as a biodefense agent and it enables us to conduct pivotal studies to expand cethromycins potential spectrum of activity beyond the success that was demonstrated in preventing inhalation anthrax
3666993 our initial evaluation of cethromycin against burkholderia pseudomallei shows that it is very active and may have a more favorable resistance profile than other approved antibiotics in treating melioidosis
3666994 this government funding from dtra for the advanced development of cethromycin to treat bioterror pathogens serves as a critical step that may result in advances for both national security and public health
3666995 the u s government is committed to identifying and acquiring a next generation antibiotic that has activity against more that one category a and b bioterror pathogen if cethromycin can demonstrate potent activity through the studies funded by this contract we believe it will be well positioned to compete for revenues from a potential stockpile contract

3667008 the images the tape was provoking in my imagination were enormous i kept seeing a vast spectacle
3667009 if jobriath is where music is going i want out
3667010 i made two errors of judgment in my days at elektra and jobriath was one of them
3667011 a flashy an provocative debut album jobriath brings to rock a voice uncannily reminiscent of mick jaggers and a theatrical intuitiveness and thematic sensibility that are superficially similar to avid bowies like bowie jobriath is fascinated with extraterrestrial fantasies that combine autoeroticism and prophecy though jobriaths musical and poetic vernacular are blunter deliberately eschewing intellectual sophistication for a bold populist stance
3667012 presenting jobriath in the way he must be presented means you have to break all the rules that requires the greatest promoter in the world and im it

3667016 during the second quarter of 2008 we achieved solid financial results leveraging our diversified business portfolio while our community based internet value added services experienced negative seasonality our online gaming wireless and online advertising businesses all registered solid growth we expect the third quarter will present strong seasonality for our internet value added services but the growth may be partly offset by negative impact of the olympics event as users spend more time watching the event
3667017 on the other hand we currently have more than 500 people working on olympics related initiatives we are going to leverage the historical olympics event to further develop the recognition of our portal qq com as the leading online media for users and advertisers

3667032 its a cycle of madness because each generation is doomed to repeat because no generation is equipped from the previous generation that is how i came to forgive my parents because i took at look at the parents they grew up with and so on and realized that all parents are trying to do the best they can with what they got given i know a lot of fathers are trying to find their way in the dark
3667033 one could argue that religion has killed any thought that other ways of rearing children might actually work
3667034 football is a prime example but now that we are forbidden from expressing the testosterone fuelled aggression
3667035 a tv series i saw recently defined bravery as a guy who wakes in the morning looks at his wife and kids and does not run away that is the root of our fear we all want to run away no one likes responsibility
3667036 you think a guy holding a gun is tough guy no the guy who gets up early everyday and goes to work then comes home to his family thats the real tough guy
3667037 what would l be doing what did i miss out on
3667038 because you dont think anything with which you disagree merits any discussion on anyones part or mulling over on
3667039 in greece i used to grab all my friends hug them kiss them slap them etc here in california if i did that to my friends they woud be worried that i was trying to hit on them and when i hug my own stepfather his face turns red yet hes guy in a milllion hed do anything for me anything to help anybody
3667040 look mom we are not going to cry at a sad movie sorry it would be embarrassing
3667041 but they have to live and work in the world outside our family and guys dont go to the movies and cry in that world valid emotion or not
3667042 and there is the overcompensation factor making up for a barely there father who had his own issues with this messy emotional business

3667047 fraport traffic figures july 2008 strike affects passenger figures and aircraft movements
3667048 i think that there is no single answer to this dilemma
3667049 increasing the number of women in media changing policies and increasing public funding for media and the inclusion by media companies of gender policies and mechanisms to put them in place might help solve the problem and contribute to parity in media
3667050 media is tough job and it is not for sissies
3667051 i am not a sexist or a conservative person as i would like to see gender parity in media but i am just concerned about the not so mentally tough attitude of our female colleagues who often fail to get it right all the times
3667052 it is not something new in our society everywhere in the world there is still a lot of negative and pessimistic attitudes to see gender equality prevail
3667053 general prejudice exists all over the place and this is something that will never be solved in our lifetime we as artisans of this historical process of self determination need to prepare our children to carry on with fighting for change
3667054 and we have to lead the way and do it with conviction and passion media people are a symbol of enlightenment and my view about social change is that it has to start with people who are there who will build on what they already have but it is a long and complex struggle

3667062 the public has done a good job of getting it out of their yards and out to the streets
3667063 this data is a vital tool to investigations and intelligence gathering in support of national security and crime
3667064 communications data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3667065 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest
3667066 many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data
3667067 yet again the government has proved itself unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances
3667068 ministers have proven time and time again that they are not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seem intent on pressing ahead with this snoopers charter

3667076 do the parties have any other issues or objections that you would like to raise that you have not previously raised
3667077 there is local concern that this latest consultation is a delaying tactic and i want the government to be clear with everyone as to the aim of the consultation is it to gauge demand for the service or is it to determine the best timetable
3667078 there have already been very clear indications of support locally and it is important to know if the government accepts that demand exists
3667079 while the government dither over this local people are missing out on the opportunity for an improved transport system and a boost to the economy
3667080 i have also asked some further questions about the legalities surrounding the use of any operator other than calmac to provide a ferry service and whether the government itself has taken formal or informal expressions of interest in operating a service between lochboisdale and mallaig as they are now saying this would be necessary if another operator were to be involved
3667081 everyone needs absolute clarity on the ground rules here and my questions are designed to help tease this out as every new twist and turn emerges in this saga
3667082 it would be great to think there could be an easy consensus on every detail of the service if it were that easy it would probably have become apparent by now
3667083 in the final analysis progress will depend upon the minister making a decision
3667084 he is no doubt praying his decision can be popular with everyone but such decisions seldom are
3667085 the minister needs to make his mind up and get on with commissioning the new service and he shouldnt count on this latest consultation saving him from any difficult decisions

3667116 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3667117 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3667118 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3667119 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3667120 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3667121 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3667122 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3667123 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3667124 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3667125 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3667126 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3667127 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3667128 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3667129 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3667130 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3667131 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3667132 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3667133 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3667134 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3667135 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3667136 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3667137 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3667138 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3667139 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3667140 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3667141 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3667142 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3667143 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3667144 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3667145 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3667146 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3667147 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3667148 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3667149 a wonderful mix of tim burton sam raimi peter jackson
3667150 there is a place a place called grockleton where high atop a scenic hillside stands the lonely beesleys manor
3667151 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3667152 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3667153 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3667154 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3667155 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3667156 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3667157 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3667158 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3667159 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3667160 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3667161 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3667162 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3667163 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3667164 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3667165 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3667166 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3667167 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3667168 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3667169 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3667170 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3667171 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3667172 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3667173 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3667174 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3667175 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3667176 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3667177 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3667178 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3667179 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3667180 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3667181 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3667186 the nice thing about a zoo is that you can put your arms around it he says from san francisco chronicle
3667187 at the news conference zoological society chairman nick podell lavishly praised the
3667188 the very public tragedy overshadows decades of problems and the troubles of the current zoo administration
3667189 it would appear that his management style which downplays the value of staff and the welfare of animals remains in place
3667190 the boys especially the older one were roaring at them he was taunting them
3667191 they were trying to get that lions attention the lion was bristling so i just said come on lets get out of here because my kids were disturbed by it
3667192 as a result of this investigation police believe that the tiger may have been taunted agitated by its eventual victims
3667193 this factor contributed to the tiger escaping from its enclosure and attacking its victims
3667194 when they got down they heard a noise in the bushes and the tiger was jumping out of the bushes on him paul dhaliwal
3667195 in the meantime i cant get out of my head the parents of those youngsters and how they brought them up is it so difficult to teach your child some basic rules for life
3667196 theyre untouchable knowing most people will be intimidated by their lack of respect and willingness to be confrontationa l unfortunately for this boy tigers dont know that
3667197 hey lady we dont want to fight with a pregnant woman
3667198 why not if youll taunt a innocent boy who cant defend himself why not a pregannt woman
3667199 instead they will hire a lawyer go on talk shows and become famous is that screwed up or what
3667200 its not personal dammit stop planting deer food and they wont come
3667201 tim ill have to let you go weve got another deer emergency
3667202 shes not dead shes probably just resting and im fairly certain there is no fawn
3667203 i may not have been raised on a farm but im
3667204 that deer is as dead as you can get and her fawn is over there on the other side of our creek
3667205 well have to approach very quietly or we might scare it
3667206 listen if that doe died after giving birth she probably was too old or too sick to survive it that might mean she wasnt able to feed this little thing either and thats not good if animal services cant get any milk into her she wont make it
3667207 sadly the reason we cant do this as well inside our own species is because there are those who would as soon call you crazy as be touched by your experience
3667208 the ability to look at our enemy or what we think is our enemy and see ourselves people animals that just want what we do
3667209 i didnt know lavender was a greek flower good to know

3667214 the first overarching big problem is to make the good person we must have better human beings or else it is quite possible that we may all be wiped out and even if not wiped out certainly live in tension and anxiety as a a species

3667219 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
3667220 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
3667221 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners

3667226 saya hanya tidak ingin anak bangsa ini dibodoh bodohi oleh sejarah yang belum tentu kebenarannya diseluruh buku pelajaran sejarah ataupun pendidikan moral pancasila selalu dituliskan bahwa indonesia dijajah belanda selama 350 tahun atau 3 5 abad tanpa pernah diuraikan sejak tahun berapa sampai tahun berapa penjajahan itu sebenarnya
3667227 andaikan dikarenakan sebuah kesalahan atau saya melakukan perbuatan tindak pidana sehingga pengadilan menghukum saya dengan hukuman penjara selama 1 tahun maka saya akan akui kepada siapapun bahwa saya telah dihukum selama 1 tahun bukankah suatu hal yang bodoh ketika saya keluar dari penjara lalu saya katakan kepada teman teman bahwa saya telah dihukum selama 3 5 tahun kenapa saya harus bangga atas kesalahan kebodohan dan kelemahan saya
3667228 lubis saya akan pelajari berapa tahun sebenarnya indonesia dijajah belanda tapi sebaiknya kamu coba kirim pertanyaan itu ke majalah tempo pada rubric pembaca menulis dan tujukan kepada pakar pakar sejarah indonesia
3667229 kesimpulannya tidak benar kita dijajah belanda selama 350 tahun yang benar adalah belanda memerlukan waktu 300 tahun untuk menguasai seluruh nusantara

3667256 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3667257 i was also surprised at the mistakes made by the u s team
3667258 as for the gymnastics this gold medal can attract more children to the gymnasiums in china
3667259 with todays performance of the team we really showed this is a sport full of vitality expectations and hope

3667282 since most goods depend on exclusivity for their value especially goods which are said to decry mainstream life a purchasing arms race is created whenever others begin to follow the same tendencies if you lag you become mainstream

3667336 secrets and cover ups of 28 years was all pouring out there still is a lot people dont know it was easier to shut it down instead of face more embarrasment and humiliation what has been revealed is only the tip of the iceberg
3667337 what has also now become clear is that the leader and name withheld put immense pressure on all the people who were called to give evidence and some of them have now admitted
3667338 how bout you and i go down to a homeless shelter and help out then maybe well be grateful for what we have
3667339 therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation old things have passed away behold all things have become new
3667340 while bethel community was formed with the best of intentions and has supported families for more than 25 years recent misconduct and longer term structural cultural and behaviour issues within bethel mean that the communitys ongoing existence is no longer justifiable
3667341 it is clear that a proposal to reform restructure and rebuild the community on the foundations of the old organisation which had been under consideration is untenable particularly as aspects and physical reminders of the old organisation are a continuing source of some considerable pain to former members of the community
3667342 we deeply regret that the original genuine christian mission of the community has been subverted by certain actions and activities that the remaining members of the community find totally unacceptable and do not condone
3667343 do you think they just stopped being good and put on a black spider man outfit and became bad
3667344 maybe they just drifted from their yours original goal but give them a break its not a fun job
3667345 say a prayer for them instead of hating them god knows it will make you feel better
3667346 just take care you may have discussed things which are deep personal and even embarrassing take care if someone gets pissed off at you it could be twisted turned and made to sound very sordid and wrong by our lovely wa editor can he sleep at night
3667347 you do remember that you will die one day and meet god
3667348 and rather than admit you made a mistake you are pissing on it

3667351 it got lost in the paper work and priorities and it came to an end and i hadnt done anything about it and sometimes things fall through the cracks
3667352 current bethel community chairman rob crothers said he had not seen the 2000 report but he said he would be surprised if the issues had not been followed up by the archbishop if they had been raised
3667353 some members have witnessed some of the bethel men touching or pinching womens buttocks or publicly discussing sexual freedoms a woman ought to be enjoying or even employing with her husband
3667354 mr horgan said to a woman how do you have an orgasm on another occasion he said to a married woman i know what position you take you use doggy position your husband told me
3667355 no complaints about sexual misconduct were received until 2007 when concerns about the conduct of the leader were brought to bishop sproxton by a third party
3667356 every case they were taken up by the archbishop or the liaison chaplain with the bethel leadership in order to effect some change
3667357 mr horgan suggested to a married woman whilst at a restaurant that she emulate the example of another married woman in the community who had taken her undies off and placed them in her husbands pocket
3667358 our experiences as indicated above have led us to have some grave concerns
3667359 these concerns centre around the seeming endorsement of the bethel community by the catholic church and we are particularly concerned given the experiences we have had of the influence of bethel community over ourselves as members
3667360 no complaints about sexual misconduct were received until 2007 when concerns about the conduct of the leader were brought to bishop donald sproxton by a third party
3667361 it was around the middle of 1994 just after i had left bethel which i had joined in 1984 when i was 18 years old that i went to the archbishop
3667362 kevin was always obsessing about womens boobs and he said something about my boobs and i just started lifting my top up in exasperation just calling his bluff basically
3667363 but the grossest thing was one day i was at his house for a family lunch and he came up while i was sitting and under the pretence of massaging my shoulders he pushed his genitals into the small of my back it was so gross
3667364 that was a real aha moment because if i said get off me he would say you are so uptight you are not free in the lord and you arent relaxed about peoples bodies
3667365 i just squirmed which was enough for him to know that i wasnt going to fall for it he would act inappropriately and then tell people they were uptight and he was trying to free them
3667366 so i went to his archbishop hickeys offices and he just said oh thats terrible but he told me just forget the past i never heard from him again about these incidents
3667367 the matters are tangled and complex and not open to easy solutions
3667368 i can only now hope and pray that bethel can regroup and prosper under the very different structure that has been worked out
3667369 oh um well then kev that does sound scriptual when you explain the undies on the table story its just that when the 13 page report described it it sounded really inappropriate glad youve cleared that up then still getting the bums on seats then and doing the music at st josephs in subi good good
3667370 give the gifts away theyre extra baggage now therell be more gifts to come
3667371 dont be afraid for i am with you do not be dismayed for i am your god i will strengthen you i will help you i will uphold you with my victorious hand
3667372 so that kind of gives me the impression that theyre putting in a complaint against cafepress stores selling stuff based on their product but i havent got a clue
3667373 what may have happened if thered been an act 4 because there will be more is this just hopeful thinking or is something definitely going ahead

3667376 the investigation is over and some people feel aggrieved for a long time understandably
3667377 however the reorganisation is in hand it is an independent organisation and has its own authority structure and i dont interfere with that they are able to run their own affairs and correct their own mistakes
3667378 during his bishop sproxtons investigation of those concerns and his interviews with current and former community members the opportunity was created for complaints to be raised about sexual misconduct but none was raised
3667379 bishop sproxton wrote to the community about ways to improve attitudes
3667380 the first complaint to bishop sproxton about sexual misconduct was made
3667381 30 years of cover ups and lies why are they trying to hold it together
3667382 i am living such a great life i feel soooo sorry for all you outsiders
3667383 we are men of jesus christ weve come to serve the lord
3667384 freedom is never again taken for granted again if youve been in bethel and dealt with what it costs to leave and to feel normal again
3667385 headship and seeing ones own head simply side with the
3667386 that truth vindicates all the hurt and pain recorded on these pages and shows up past bethel attitudes culture as being inherently misguided questions why is frank still accepted in bethel why is he still being paid why is pam still in a leadership role in ccr lives and families irrepairably damaged by these people what does frank do for his wages is he still on elders wages wa can add to its list of very clever con men who milked the company bethel for all it could get i totally agree how can rob carrouthers be impartial when he cant afford to upset his father in law i think that rc is being unfairly targetted i think that he was asked to do a job by the community he is doing it the position is interim and elections for office bearers if the community continues it will be for all positions the people will be able to vote for whomever they want yes he is related to frank and pam and this makes the job much harder but it is not like the brisbane group on 4 corners where the relatives are in long term leadership positions i have just watched a taped copy of the 4 corners program one thing is really different though they were an evangelical group without affiliation to a main line church when i was in bethel i tried to ignore my concerns for years because i trusted the connection that we had with the church there were all the signs of this connection that people have already talked about and that really mattered to me the liaison priest the blessed sacrament and the catholic fellowship the formal statutes with the archdiocese khs meetings with the archbishop and the archbishops visits to the community it made me think that perhaps nothing was really wrong i just wasnt seeing things straight i cant remember anything that would have made me think that the church didnt completely approve and support bethel even the review that fr cr conducted made bethel look quite squeaky clean so it seemed that all the problems and difficult issues i and other people i knew had raised werent really that valid after all i dont know whether bethel people mind being cut adrift from the church as it seems they are now i just wish it had happened a lot sooner it would have made it easier for some of us to trust our own common sense without kh holding over us just how favoured he and his ways were by the church about rc i really cant comment about anything that was said above i would feel a lot easier if i knew that he or any other leader of bethel short term or not didnt make defensive statements like bethel is not a cult were just ordinary people etc i think any one who cares anything about the people of bethel or feels any sense of responsibility for them has to be saying how come when people go to a recomended
3667387 oh sweet jesus its not what the lord would want i wont be able to keeping pawing you for sex and knocking you up if i see you slovenly and wearing ugly jeans
3667388 gods told me that he wants to put you in a nice feminine skirt to avoid me looking at your camel toe vpl and huge arse no offence maxine this enlightenment was done to spite you all elders wives cant have a great figure
3667389 we are committed to doing the right thing by the victims of alleged misconduct whether they be current or former members of bethel we are taking professional external advice to help us do that
3667390 arent you just a bit sick of the symbolic abstract gestures put up as solutions to problems by the church no one seems to be able to stand up and face the truth
3667391 ohhh look a great big open wound lets grab a few bandaids to try and hold it together
3667392 i heard from a meeting that one of the new elders had with certain named people that there were possibly four buyers at between 12 14 million the assets 12 14 million could if the new leaders decided so go to the v de p or a similar charity provided it had that critical distribution clause the arch has no rights my understanding is that they are going to sell buy something in osborne park or balcatta and build a smaller purpose built centre leaving the remainder for running costs
3667393 we did a count the other week and came up with 328 adults who had left not counting two i heard about yesterday and a lot that are in wait and see mode i have just counted the directory and i get 86 as to the reasons i would say with confidence that 90 went because of the leaders vindictiveness and coercion or they could not live up to the rigidness and were frightened of getting into trouble even those like name withheld who left to join a religious order later wrote me a letter saying that in fact it was a ploy to get out
3667394 im not backing off what i said there will be full open and free internet access during games time to allow journalists to report on the olympics
3667395 but i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked
3667396 people want to know whats going on with these facilities mostly people dont even think of getting inspection reports because its never been easily available
3667397 john ray is a fully accredited china correspondent who was doing his legitimate job as a journalist
3667398 we intend to protest in the strongest possible terms to the chinese authorities and seek assurances that the treatment meted out to mr ray will not be repeated
3667399 the ioc has learned through media reports that a british journalist was allegedly assaulted today while covering a demonstration near an olympic venue in beijing
3667400 the iocs position is clear the media must be free to report on the olympic games
3667401 we are endeavouring to discover the full facts of this incident and if necessary will raise our concerns with the appropriate authority
3667402 no estamos pensando en los partidos de la copa de la uefa la liga ahora centra nuestra atenci n y los partidos europeos s lo son un extra el keflav k est muy cerca de nosotros en la tabla
3667403 es grandioso para los aficionados del f tbol de islandia que el aston villa venga aqu con sus jugadores m s conocidos y con un gran entrenador por lo que ser un tremendo partido la victoria ante el kr ha impulsado nuestra confianza para el partido ante el villa y estaremos preparados
3667404 no puedo decir cuales son nuestras posibilidades ante el aston villa pero no nos daremos por vencidos y en buen d a podemos clasificarnos en ocasiones este tipo de partidos sacan lo mejor de nuestros jugadores ya que hay mucho m s en juego y quiz s nuestros rivales puedan subestimarnos y eso puede ser una gran ayuda
3667405 opened up the floodgates for people to respect different cultures and also respect our beauty in each culture
3667406 young girls look at magazines and want to see a reflection of themselves and that will tell them that they exist and that they are beautiful
3667407 so we need asians we need black we need latin we need every culture represented in fashion to show that young girl that she matters that she exists and that she is beautiful
3667408 he has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault which has caused very significant bruising to the forearm
3667409 with an iron heel upon the head of the filthy abortion and put and end to its crawlings
3667410 all our thoughts are with his family at this time
3667411 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3667412 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3667413 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3667414 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3667415 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3667416 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3667417 growing up i always wanted to be an olympian now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it started setting in a little bit after the butterfly i was just trying to focus on my next race but i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3667418 ive got three races left so there had better be something left in the tank
3667419 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3667420 there is nobody in our sport that can win like he wins
3667421 he is not just winning he is crunching world records
3667422 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3667423 its the most fun thing to be in a team environment and be part of a relay its cool when you get four americans who all swim well together everyone has to play their part or its just not going to happen weve been lucky that weve been able to do that
3667424 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3667425 any medal in an event that is not on your regular program is great
3667426 i went out there and i raced tough and thats all i can do
3667427 it was definitely a tough day but i think i handled it pretty well
3667428 the army and security forces will not yield to attempts to terrorize them with attacks and crimes

3667437 ive never seen her wearing an engagement ring i actually thought she and adam brody whos also in the movie were dating they were very flirty with each other and were always hanging out together when they werent working
3667438 ive never asked her why she doesnt always put it on
3667439 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been scattered
3667440 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3667441 but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress there is still much work to be done
3667442 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3667443 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3667444 subsequent statements have been a reflection of events on the ground
3667445 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3667446 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3667447 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3667448 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3667449 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3667450 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3667451 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3667452 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3667453 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3667454 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3667455 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress

3667472 its not as typical pub sport and its something different for our customers it just seemed like a laid back chilled game that you could play over a beer it makes a change doing something different and its a bit of gallic flair which is always nice
3667473 it was very friendly but people wanted to win there was lots of whoopping and cheering i think the fact it fits in with having a glass of wine makes it very suitable for a pub environment our regulars seem to enjoy trying their hand at it and we have some decent players here
3667474 i has heard of a league in tilehurst and other pubs in the area setting up boule areas so its something that is catching on i guess its popular because people are travelling more and have seen people having as go at this im glad they are trying something different and i hope it catches on even more
3667475 whats sick is i can have the worst day ever come home and play the mookie get kicked in the junk and still feel so much better than before
3667476 people thought i was going away for a week to lie in bed but it was hard work it was nice to be back in the environment i love as acting is my main passion it would have been nice to have had a speaking role but you never know what might happen in the future
3667477 it was quite weird seeing myself like that and quite unnerving being on the show that has run for many years
3667478 this is simply not a time for politics as usual
3667479 its a different john mccain saying make the tax cuts permanent
3667480 very large number of us feel deeply that john mccain good man that he is will be a continuation of bush
3667481 i support providing health care to our employees im not objecting to that
3667482 but im concerned we are making a decision that goes outside the authority in statute granted to the college
3667483 to say you have to have specific state authorization for everything would not work you would never have that
3667484 i think its critical for the integrity of the industry
3667485 its almost hard to believe that the state allowed this to go on for the magnitude that it did there really shouldnt be unscrupulous people in this industry especially when youre talking about the largest investment most people will make
3667486 ample evidence to show that crime in the mortgage lending industry has reached record levels
3667487 were trying to do what we can to alleviate the current situation
3667488 you always wish you could do better on certain issues
3667489 we were applying the statutes as effectively as we could
3667490 the bottom line is we have to protect our citizens

3667496 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time
3667497 there are too many things to be taken care of its understandable that errors will occur
3667498 i think a drop of 20 percent is a bit over done
3667499 weve fallen too far too fast i expect the market to sit between 110 and 120 in the short term
3667500 have taken profits as theyve seen demand destruction in the u s and theyre seeing it spread a little into europe

3667503 those values which transcend my career at glaxosmithkline and extend back to experiences from my childhood which i show in the book as having had a significant impact on my leadership beliefs today
3667504 integrity courage empathy passion are the values and behaviors of true leaders
3667505 steve has a passion for doing things the right way i have been fortunate to call steve a friend and he has made me a better leader

3667580 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent
3667581 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3667582 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3667583 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3667584 the first major memorial to honor a man of peace and person of color on the national mall
3667585 the park service needs restrooms and this is how theyre getting them
3667586 we are detracting and really desecrating the power of these monuments by adding retail
3667587 such action negates the principle of court hierarchy and justice
3667588 the attorney general of the federation being one of the brilliant jurists in the country could not have conceded to the argument that the international court of justice icj ruling supersedes our domestic law it is an open secret that virtually all the verdicts of icj are politically motivated to serve certain interests and this explains why such verdicts cannot stand the test of time
3667589 we cannot continue to pretend as a law abiding country in order to please certain interests abroad at the expense of the soul of our dear nation we are all living witnesses to how countries like the united states of america russia and even palestine have disobeyed icj orders in order to protect their nations if i may ask in whose interest is nigeria conceding bakassi to cameroun even before the pronouncement of the icj verdict the obasanjo government had clearly stated that it was not going to seek the review of whatever judgement that was given that goes to suggest that nigerian leaders have something to benefit and they have opted to compromise on the judgement for gods sake we are a sovereign nation and our laws stand supreme but because of selfish interests our leaders are not seeing things that way

3667604 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3667605 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offense and undermine respect for the law

3667618 the media continues to hammer the message of planning for your financial retirement when there are so many non financial issues to be considered including at what age do you retire do you continue working do you relocate consider wellness issues etc
3667619 it is great to receive this type of recognition from one of our industrys thought leaders there are a tremendous number of solution providers in this market and to have made this list two consecutive years is a tribute to the breadth of the hiredesk solution

3667628 we are hoping to gain strength from your precious confidence to accelerate steps together on the road to stability construction reforms and prosperity
3667629 i wonder whether we are still in a genuine democratic system who can restrict the will of a minister to resign or not resign
3667630 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3667631 the fire itself is not very big but there is going to be a lot of smoke damage
3667632 he tried to head toward us but we were careful because suicidal attackers are common in diyala
3667633 if they had a father or husband killed they will be ready to kill anyone just out of revenge even if they have to die themselves
3667634 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf thailand india and the european union and we can barely keep up with their demand
3667635 this legislation sends a strong signal to burmas military regime that the united states stands firmly on the side of my countrys democracy movement
3667636 there has always seemed to be a split within the government so a consistent policy for dealing with russia has been absent
3667637 at what point does the west do something meaningful having the president backslapping with putin at the olympics is not a serious attempt to deal with the problem
3667638 the georgians who took us at our word when we talked about a partnership have got to be wondering what bush is all about
3667639 the last thing russia wants is a war with the west if they came eye to eye with nato warplanes they would retreat
3667640 he did it in the mistaken belief i believe that he had friends
3667641 it is simply unacceptable for top government officials to be unaccountable for such a gross abuse of their power
3667642 they should have called donnie hoyle and had him give a tutorial using
3667643 it looks like im wearing maybelline water shine diamonds liquid lipstick
3667644 the situation for civil political and economic rights continues to be very unfavorable
3667645 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3667646 we live in a dangerous world we never know whats around the corner
3667647 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace and another candidate who has not
3667648 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs
3667649 not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3667650 its time to hear the roar of a strong american economy again
3667651 im going to tell them i think they are the heartland of america that the values they hold dear are the strength and character of america
3667652 theyre the reason why the people in georgia today are looking to america a beacon of hope and liberty
3667653 i think were going to be up late on election night
3667654 theres going to be two maybe three vacancies on the supreme court according to people that decide these things
3667655 its not an accident that there has not been another attack on the united states of america

3667673 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3667674 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3667675 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
3667676 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
3667677 it wasnt until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
3667678 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3667679 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
3667680 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3667681 the conditions are ripe for either a near landslide maybe 53 percent or a landslide
3667682 the decline is in retailers percentage of share for the overall pie

3667987 she was in the vanguard of the movement she recruited a generation of young leaders
3667988 the first game and the finals are more difficult for every athlete at the olympics so were really used to it
3667989 i played many good matches last year year and a half against the chinese
3667990 i always win one set always play one or two more close but in the end you know they are tough in the head and its quite difficult with them
3667991 i think i played pretty normally because i still havent completely adjusted to this competition
3667992 and in the first game i didnt have a good grasp of their spin but toward the end it was better
3667993 dont fuss at the court clerks if you do you are going to jail they have no more power over it than the nice lady at the checkout counter
3667994 i could get off of it this year if they let the fines stay what they is and dont increase them but every week and every month they go up
3667995 after a while i received a letter saying i aint reporting or calling or doing nothing i was supposed to do and she issued a warrant
3667996 probation is a priviledge sic not a right probation did not levy a fine the courts did
3667997 you be scared to walk to your mailbox because thats what the law do they ride around and try to find you youre scared to look for a job but unless you get a job you cant pay your fine so either way youre just stuck
3667998 not a lot of emphasis on supervision as much as there is on collection
3667999 i just cant stop drinking because i got so many problems in my head
3668000 these are just people struggling trying to make it the probation officers know its hard for a poor person to come up with that money they trick em into getting back in the system they go back before the judge and the judge fines them again puts them on probation again and the cycle repeats itself
3668001 you cant get id in this society anymore if you dont have id
3668002 if you want a birth certificate you need a drivers license if you want a drivers license you have to have a birth certificate and a social security card and to get a social security card you have to have a drivers license its this crazy cycle
3668003 el desfiladero de kodori abjasia fue bombardeado por aviones rusos pido una investigaci n internacional para establecer de qui n son esas bombas para que no nos acusen a nosotros
3668004 las tropas terrestres rusas avanzan en diversas direcciones por ejemplo hacia poti junto al puerto de poti en el mar los rusos destruyeron nuestros buques
3668005 es nuestro deber apoyar al gobierno leg timo de georgia que fue elegido por su pueblo
3668006 tropas de ocupaci n deben ser retiradas y sustituidas por fuerzas internacionales de paz
3668007 de lo contrario si contin an los asesinatos no tienen sentido las reuniones ni los debates es hora de despertarse y actuar

3668011 law experience to qualify for the law critical skill a candidate must qualify under the law entry program i e have a jd degree from a resident law school
3668012 i also believe to a certain degree that if you want someone to share something with you you need to share something with them this could be as small as sharing the other university projects we are involved in or what our favorite meal is as we did last monday
3668013 by tony krawitz you are going to say but our subject is about women i know in fact the movie is about the relationship of a 23 year old boy yuri who just lost his father in an early age with the community and especially her grandmother
3668014 started in 1982 in a elderly house of massachusetts composed by elders who lived through both world wars
3668015 perhaps its the occassion of playing at the olympics you dont get a chance to play here often so i told myself i must do better
3668016 i dont want my tournament to end in the next match i want to do the best that i possibly can
3668017 i might not have grown up in the best environment but i was supported by everyone around me that is how i get these great results
3668018 it is because of them that i am able to get this far
3668019 we all played very well the fielders hit especially well and scored a lot of runs so i could pitch wholeheartedly
3668020 there is absolutely the possibility for the character to recur shes wonderful and if she wants to come back shes more than welcome
3668021 she is not just in one or two scenes she is in a significant portion of the scenes she is singing and dancing but we do want to keep some of that a secret
3668022 we can confirm that this isnt true none of it
3668023 the studio producers director and potential star cruise are all waiting on a rewrite of the script from kurt wimmer which is due in a few weeks will smith has not been approached to star cruise is the only actor who has been approached
3668024 the role was his idea it wasnt even in the script i didnt have to persuade him
3668025 tom is amazing wed be talking about the characters and in the middle of the conversation hed say something like my character should have these giant hands
3668026 belum beliau tidak kembali bertugas lagi saya tidak tahu ke mana beliau berada ketika ini
3668027 kami menyerahkan perkara ini kepada pihak polis untuk menyiasatnya saya tidak boleh mengulas lanjut mengenainya
3668028 what an odd denial who accused young of funneling campaign funds to support rielle in the first place i wonder if any member of our crack mainstream media will bother to check into this interesting thread
3668029 which political candidate enjoys visiting new york because he has a girlfriend who lives downtown the pol tells her hell marry her when his current wife is out of the picture
3668030 before he was running for president john edwards made a series of awesome short documetaries sic that later vanished from the internet until now
3668031 interesting bit of trivia did you know trippi also worked for the gary hart campaign as deputy political director after hart got busted with donna rice he became chief of staff to harts wife now hes out defending elizabeth edwards
3668032 not lost in the matter is the irony of edwards stance after all the videos were made with the apparent goal of bringing transparency to the political process
3668033 its ironic that the edwards campaign webisodes made by rielle hunter initially produced to bring the campaign publicity made their biggest splash when the campaign attempted to hide them
3668034 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
3668035 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
3668036 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3668037 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3668038 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3668039 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3668040 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3668041 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3668042 this country russia seeks to restore its dominance but the time of dominance is over
3668043 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression

3668056 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3668057 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3668058 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3668059 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3668060 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3668061 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3668062 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3668063 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3668064 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3668065 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3668066 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3668067 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3668072 its a democratic artwork everybody is going to come in and theyre all going to walk across the floor
3668073 look at the opening ceremony of the olympics do we say so what
3668074 certainly you dont have to have this on the floor and you can be totally utilitarian but if you can have something of beauty that people can derive pleasure from then why not
3668075 some felt that the town should not be engaged in funding non critical services and some felt that public art was as vital as parks and recreation
3668076 i am a big supporter of it as long as its in public areas and visible and able to be used in the public
3668077 people start to recognize the design and quality and how they see the town changes
3668078 it adds to the cultural network of the town art shouldnt be elitist and its not a mystery

3668130 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3668131 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3668132 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3668133 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3668134 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
3668135 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3668140 british people have a reputation of being bad between the sheets and it now seems in some respects that it is correct
3668141 while our euro neighbours seem to see sex as one long indulgence many of us just want a drunken quickie before we nod off to sleep
3668142 britains massive booze culture has a lot to do with it
3668143 these nightmarish thoughts are a manifestation of how much the credit crunch is affecting our daily lives and causing distressed sleep patterns
3668144 dreaming about being chased or falling is a reaction to the stresses we face in life
3668145 its no wonder gordon brown and alistair darling are making a special appearance in our nightmares at the moment
3668146 both symbolise the fears we are facing in todays economy
3668147 we are happy to report that cassinis begun sending data home
3668148 the downlink will continue through the night and into tomorrow morning

3668150 over the next few days and weeks the cassini teams will be analyzing the photos and other data to tease out new clues about this tiny active world
3668151 sar un campionato vivo occhio al napoli che ha buone basi di partenza
3668152 non ho dubbi sar una sfida tra inter e roma secondo me i giallorossi partono alla pari
3668153 the two strikers are top class and on the same level as anyone if they play together a lot i think they can form a really good understanding and then they can go on and get better and better
3668154 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from them at the very top of their game i dont think theyve got another level to go to
3668155 take nothing away from united because theyve been fantastic but they have had a lot of players in their team who have hit the peak of their form in the last two years
3668156 united know that every year were going to give them a right good go for their money we are no longer a nearly team
3668157 we need to raise the bar at the end of the day last season we wasnt good enough
3668158 it still hurts me to see pictures of united lifting those trophies
3668159 now we need to set ourselves big targets to win the premiership win the fa cup and get back to the final of the champions league and win it those are the targets
3668160 luiz felipe scolaris a very experienced man like ferguson and knows exactly what hes doing
3668161 im sure the manager has a few tricks up his sleeve along the way and hopefully we can stop him getting involved in any of the taking an early lead in the premiership and elading all the way
3668162 of course i want to be england captain but whoever he chooses ill fully respect and if its not me ill walk up to the other person and shake their hand
3668163 these games are very dangerous so we will be very focused on the game
3668164 the first game is really important we have the advantage of playing the second leg at anfield but if we can have a good result in the first game then it will be better for us
3668165 i dont think the financial need to qualify for the group stages puts on any added pressure every year it has been the same we have experience of this in the past and weve always got through so hopefully we can do the same
3668166 but every club the top sides especially must be aware of the quality of the other teams in this competition you must be focused for every game and you cant change things if you make a mistake
3668167 pre season has been difficult with the players having come back at different times but were really pleased with the way the young players have come through and showed their quality the way the senior players and new players have done and the mood is really good
3668168 i havent seen too may of their games but the staff have been watching them and because they have changed the coach well need to see what effect that has
3668169 they are a good team and we know they are especially tough when they are playing at home they are very strong in defence and dont concede a lot of goals
3668170 they might not be used to the champions league but they only lost one league game last season and showed their quality
3668171 whenever you play away from home in europe its always difficult
3668172 we have confidence in our players but when you play against a good team in europe you need to be careful we know they lost to st etienne recently in a friendly but they beat anderlecht in the belgian super cup
3668173 i have had a great pre season run and am the fittest i have ever been
3668174 i am really looking forward to this season and know i can do a job for the team
3668175 its not going to be easy for me but i am up for the fight and am working very hard
3668176 my english has improved and i have settled well in liverpool now i need the chance to prove my quality
3668177 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from them at the very top of their game i dont think theyve got another level to go to
3668178 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against liege tomorrow i am only concentrating on this game
3668179 and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preparation for this match i prefer not to say anything else
3668180 i have not been distracted i have been focusing on this game and getting to the champions league group stages
3668181 there is no more pressure than in previous seasons we all know how important it is to get past this qualifying round
3668182 everyone knows how important the champions league is for us we must play well
3668183 we know standard are a good team especially at home
3668184 every club must be aware of the quality of your opponents
3668185 you must be really focused for every game you cannot change things once you have made a mistake
3668186 we must make sure that we do qualify for the next stage
3668187 i think they could be as good as it gets in the champions league
3668188 they are both in the top class level and can be as good as anyone if they play together more games then they can get better and better
3668189 i would prefer them to have played together more but we couldnt with both torres and keane coming in late it wasnt the ideal situation but i think it could be enough
3668190 but both torres and keane are prepared enough to play well little by little they can get better if one of them or both can play well on wednesday then that would be fantastic
3668191 in the time they have had together they have played well and we have been scoring goals they need time but we have confidence in them and i think we played well in the last game against lazio
3668192 both formations were good as the team was playing well and scoring goals in both positions they were playing well they are clever players and it doesnt matter what positions they play in
3668193 everyone knows these are good players the only thing is they havent been playing together a long time they will need time
3668194 i was really calm last week and really concentrated on the game we dont have any big problems
3668195 im being allowed to pick the team without any interference
3668196 i am not distracted and i am focused on the game
3668197 if we sign any player he cant play tomorrow so im not worried about that now im concentrating on this game
3668198 alonso play why not hes our player we need him and well use him
3668199 heres a good one arsenal and united fans will buy into this one
3668200 im really happy at liverpool and i want to stay here for as long as the club wants me
3668201 i am really settled here and i like the city the most important thing is i like the club and ive really enjoyed the two seasons ive been here the only thing i am missing is some trophies and hopefully that will come in the next year
3668202 ive never had any intentions of leaving this club sometimes things are said in the press but the boss said to me that is not relevant and he wants me here with liverpool
3668203 the team has been working really hard and the new players have adapted well
3668204 the last three games we have had some good results against rangers valerenga and lazio but lets see where we are after this week if we start well on wednesday and then against sunderland in the premier league on saturday then we will have had a good pre season
3668205 we know that we are a good team we have a lot of confidence and weve just got to show that in the first games of the season
3668206 i know a bit about liege belgium is close to holland and i know their league maybe it isnt as good as a couple of years ago but they are still a good team with a few talented young players
3668207 it will definitely be tough for us and hopefully we can get a good result
3668208 this is a really important game for us so early in the season because we know if we were to lose we would be out of the champions league thats not what we want because we have had some really good results in that competition over the past few years
3668209 i have always played as a striker in my career but in the national team i have played on the right
3668210 i played there during euro 2008 for holland im not really a right winger but i can play it my own way and i like it so far the last 15 games of last season went really well we were playing well as a team and i was scoring goals and giving assists
3668211 as long as i can be important for the team im happy to play on the right side for me the most important thing is winning games and picking up trophies that is more important to me than being a striker and scoring goals
3668212 i dont care if i play as a striker a second striker or a right winger i just want to play as many games as i can and be important for the team
3668213 everyone knows him because he has played at a really good level for many years in the premier league
3668214 with the signing of robbie and the other new players hopefully we can make another good step forward
3668215 this is going to be my third season with liverpool and every year the club brings in a new striker thats liverpool because the club always wants to progress and always wants to be better its a good thing because you have to perform better as well
3668216 im not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against standard liege
3668217 im only concentrating on this game and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preparation for this i prefer not to say anything else

3668219 hydraulic energy from small dams is interesting because of its low environmental costs but everything has its limits
3668220 we predict that there will be fewer fish as a result of the energy projects on local rivers begun around 10 years ago because the dams block the fish from swimming upriver to breed
3668221 the affected rivers which are already polluted by agro chemical runoff flow towards the park where they form the xinga river and as a result the problems will be aggravated

3668301 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
3668302 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind

3668355 although ingenious and highly impressive the move is actually quite logical once you start trying to solve blacks problems
3668356 your heart sinks when you see that there is no perpetual due to 33 c5 34 nxc5 bxc5 35 qxc5 qd1 36 kh2 but then while some would give up on the whole idea of c6 c5 keith thought to himself if only there were a way of checking the king on h2 and he managed to reject the move 33 c5 but hold on to the idea black needs a check on the h file for the check on d1 to become perpetual and therefore has to get rid of the pawn on h4 hence 33 g5
3668357 apparently 2557 rated gm gdanski looked bemused and just whipped the pawn off
3668358 if you lock the idea of perpetual check in terms of qd1 g4 h5 you might run into problems because your perceptual system might filter out moves like qg4 h4 as a separate idea not associated with the perpetual this is partly a problem with the linear thinking
3668359 very few chess books are able to make an original contribution about the strategic side of chess but that is the aim of this remarkable book the dogmas of chess which have been established for more than a century are rarely questioned despite the clear evolution in the style of top class chess chess grandmaster llu s comas fabreg takes on the challenging task of separating the truth from the lies in traditional advice on how to play better chess by taking an irreverent look at the supposed absolute truths of chess comas fabreg judges the validity of established rules and strategic concepts accompanied by many practical examples and good advice readers learn how to reduce the complexity of chess towards the essential features of each position and so improve their play

3668368 during the second quarter of 2008 we achieved solid financial results leveraging our diversified business portfolio while our community based internet value added services experienced negative seasonality our online gaming wireless and online advertising businesses all registered solid growth we expect the third quarter will present strong seasonality for our internet value added services but the growth may be partly offset by negative impact of the olympics event as users spend more time watching the event
3668369 on the other hand we currently have more than 500 people working on olympics related initiatives we are going to leverage the historical olympics event to further develop the recognition of our portal qq com as the leading online media for users and advertisers
3668370 the history of behaviour of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat

3668375 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3668376 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3668377 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3668378 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3668379 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3668380 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3668381 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom

3668385 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3668386 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3668387 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3668388 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3668389 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3668390 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3668391 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3668392 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3668393 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3668394 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful

3668398 we know that the sacred trust cannot expire when the uniform comes off when we fail to keep faith with our veterans the bond between our nation and our nations heroes becomes frayed when a veteran is denied care we are all dishonored caring for those who serve and for their families is a fundamental responsibility of the commander in chief it is not a separate cost it is a cost of war

3668406 i dont know about you all but cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony

3668461 eva green is outstandingly beautiful and impossibly well dressed but also affecting as primal bond girl vesper lynd instead of double entrendres we get crackling dialogue
3668462 casino royale is the most exciting bond film in conventional action terms but also in dramatic meat
3668463 black is the color of my true loves hair her lips are like some roses fair she has the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands i love the ground whereon she stands
3668464 between one person and another there is just a light
3668465 i have the advantage in hollywood that the studio people do not put me off at once although i am french
3668466 mum says permanently that this business is hard you are always dependent on others ideas you constantly have to prove something
3668467 absolutely mad only to prove that i can manage the role the first three months i thought they would fire me at once
3668468 she now as a noble princess seduces english noble men in transparent gowns
3668469 i think people were hoping it would be out then but without the film actually having a production start date there cant be a due date
3668470 when the first film was in production i was talking to the studio and to writer director chris weitz and producers quite frequently im sure i would be now if the sequel was in production
3668471 i know everyone would like to see a sequel and i know id like to see it
3668472 shes with me in dublin during some days on the filming of cracks jordan scott daughter of ridley
3668473 de daling is duidelijk te wijten aan de economische crisis het vertrouwen van de belgische verbruikers gaat duidelijk achteruit vooral vergeleken met dat van de nederlandse verbruikers
3668474 in 2007 voorspelden we dat er tijdens het eerste semester van 2008 wellicht 20 procent meer flatscreens zouden verkocht worden uiteindelijk werden er slechts 5 procent meer verkocht
3668475 het is genoeg om met je gezicht op tv te verschijnen talent heeft daar eigenlijk niets mee te maken
3668476 ik denk dat dit nummer laat zien dat de humor van queen niet verloren is gegaan
3668477 evas went missing and wasnt delivered to her in time
3668478 when joan realised the french star didnt have a necklace she generously parted with her own it had more than 3 000 diamonds including one six carat stone to make sure eva was suitably attired when she faced the cameras
3668479 joans good deed puts her on sparkling terms with bond girl eva
3668480 the artistic directors made that decision after consultation with the broadcasters
3668481 the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3668482 it was a joint decision to achieve the most theatrical effects
3668483 i do not think there is anything wrong with that
3668484 we have to put it in the context of the opening ceremony that is a casting issue that we have in every performance
3668485 it is clear for me that the right information has to be given to the people
3668486 when i was 15 i went to galway on an exchange its one of my best memories
3668487 coming back from a work point of view is very different the countryside is magnificent and mysterious this is the best role ive ever read its amazing quite dark
3668488 the crew is smaller but thats great because you become so close you become a lot closer to the director its a great relationship i have with her
3668489 the countryside is so beautiful and magical here the location really lends itself to this very ethereal and magical film we started shooting last week and its going really well although we have had tonnes of rain
3668490 we were fortunate to go to cannes with the wind that shakes the barley and garage last year i like to think well be going to cannes with this next year

3668493 the zimbabwe defence forces have demonstrated unparalleled patriotism and professionalism in the way they have carried the constitutional role of defending our nation
3668494 it is indeed a result of the alert vigilant and patriotic manner in which the zdf and our other security forces have conducted their day to day duties
3668495 this faithfulness to their mission statement is key to the laying of a solid foundation for the social economic and political development of our country
3668496 outstanding both locally and on the international front metarmophosing gradually into a formidable force that is the envy of many a nation
3668497 this has seen the zdf being deployed to various parts of the world to maintain and where necessary enforce peace the continued participation of the zdf in united nations missions speaks volumes of their level of professionalism and discipline as well as the confidence that the international community has in them
3668498 between last years celebrations and today yesterday military personnel were seconded to the gmb where they assisted in distributing grain and farming inputs air zimbabwe where defence forces technicians and engineers assisted the airlines technical department and to the civil aviation authority of zimbabwe where firefighters and fire tenders provided cover
3668499 the defence forces were also deployed to the ministries of science and technology agriculture and transport and communications where they assisted in various capacities while military medical personnel were seconded to the ministry of health and child welfare to buttress the nations health delivery system
3668500 as a responsive force the defence forces are always prepared to assist the nation whenever and wherever there is need
3668501 when floods broke out in muzarabani middle sabi valley mwenezi and gokwe areas the zdf moved in to evacuate marooned residents in addition to the evacuation process afz helicopters were also utilised in ferrying food relief supplies to the affected areas
3668502 zimbabwe defence forces creating a peaceful environment conducive for investment productivity and economic growth
3668503 to date the army engineers corps have cleared an area of 213 500 square metres and removed a total of 4 531 anti personnel landmines in the process
3668504 it is particularly pleasing to note that the zdf engineers are still in the process of demining the sango border post to crooks corner area
3668505 we look forward to the total clearance of this minefield which will pave the way for enhanced access onto the great limpopo transfrontier park and in turn assist our economic development through increased tourist activities
3668506 several officers and men are currently in countries such as china pakistan malaysia india kenya tanzania south africa and zambia while others are at various local training institutions
3668507 in this regard five flying instructors and six aircraft technicians are currently seconded to the south african defence forces to assist in the ab initio initial training of pilots in the same vein our military training institutions continue to enrol students from other regional defence forces
3668508 in the face of the hyperinflationary environment obtaining in the country the government has continued to cushion the defence forces by awarding them regular cost of living adjustments
3668509 it is our hope that the move in tandem with other skills retention measures will go a long way in keeping medical staff within the defence forces
3668510 georgi heeft een grove vergissing begaan door zonder adequate voorbereiding een offensief in de afvallige provincie zuid osseti te lanceren
3668511 de kwestie georgi zal echter nooit tot een nieuwe koude oorlog leiden

3668513 no i dont feel ready at all i already have trouble taking care of my dog i dont know if thats my thing id need to be settled itll take some time i think
3668514 im currently in dublin filming cracks i play a swimming teacher in the 1930s who falls for one of her students
3668515 see this line across here separating this piece from the rest of your foot
3668516 and see these flecks of white around it thats where your poor foot was trying to heal itself but you snapped it off again yesterday good thing too or else it would have healed incorrectly causing a lifetime of discomfort and complications
3668517 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out ok were happy now
3668518 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie

3668521 god has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good
3668522 if this hadnt happened i would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship i have with these two little boys
3668523 it is new for both of us she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
3668524 i would hope it stands until the end of the year and then well sit back and evaluate where we are at that time where britney is at that time
3668525 the banks have been doing pretty well i dont think they have been that sensitive to interest rates as everyone thought they would be in fact they have not been performer kotak mahindra has had a bit of momentum but this is really a very short term trading recommendation because there is uncertainty about the market but this stock is going up in a market like today so intraday or maybe for a day or two it could be a pretty good trade i would look for a stoploss really at rs 648 below rs 640 it would be time to exit the position

3668529 ttk prestige is a pioneer and leader in the pressure cookers in india under its prestige super brand has evolved from a mere pressure cooker company to a total kitchens solution provider the company has transformed its distribution model by exclusive retail outlets known as prestige smart kitchens and this transformation is paying a rich dividend for the company as reflected by the fy08 results wherein the net profit stood in at rs 17 73 crore and net sales of rs 326 crore
3668530 on equity of rs 11 crore the eps should at 15 71 and again a good dividend of 35 was declared so at current valuations the stock trades at around just 7 5 times fy08 earnings and down 6 3 times fy09 earnings given the strong brand equity of the prestige brand name aggressive retail foray and product diversification the valuations appear very attractive the other upside is the value unlocking of its real estate holdings in bangalore so i have a price target of about rs 180 on the stock

3668535 i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid her father created the show
3668536 it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3668537 they didnt even get the numbers right so i dont know if its about the money either
3668538 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3668539 all our instincts as clients agencies and media owners are to encourage people to consume more super consumption
3668540 the aspiration that you should consume more the aspiration that you should have a bigger car the aspiration that you should have a number of holidays bigger houses and multiple houses
3668541 our view which is counter to what you expect our industry to argue is that conspicuous consumption is not productive and should be discouraged
3668542 the continual manufacture and disposal of electronic items like the ipod sometimes used for little more than a year is placing a burden on the environment that it is not able to bear it is fostering a mindset of super consumption where expensive items made at vast cost to the earths resources quickly become unfashionable and are not expected to last this is no doubt profitable in the short term but it is not sustainable and it is not responsible
3668543 it is increasingly common for companies to have targets to reduce their carbon footprint but look closely almost all of these are ex growth
3668544 in other words they will reduce their impact per unit sales or on the basis of like for like operations businesses that feel they know how to de couple growth from increased climate impact are few indeed absolute targets are rare
3668545 theres little if any evidence that advertising increases category size it doesnt create demand it channels demand from one brand to another if thats right advertising has no influence on total consumption
3668546 its an approach to both design and consumption that explains the essence of brands like ikea and volvo
3668547 its already happening on the fringes and in niches people are sated with consumption
3668548 the push away from mega consumption is the mega trend of the moment there are no bragging rights in acquisition anymore theres a horrible glut of things and we are moving towards a zero acquisition society
3668549 firstly climate change has profoundly affected all our lives we have awoken to the fact that we are over consuming the resources of our planet and threatening ourselves in the process
3668550 secondly we are entering a wellbeing age matched by a more selfless and non relative materialist and non growth obsessed ecological economics individualism is out individuation and community is in finally the digital revolution means we are undergoing a metamorphosis towards a new age of democracy and resurgent citizenship which could threaten the nature of corporate consumer capitalism itself
3668551 the financial crisis and commodity price inflation are sharpening the current feeling that doomsday is imminent although they are not in themselves the cause of change
3668552 a reordering of the current model of mass marketing and consumption is inevitable
3668553 in the near future there will be all sorts of legislation that will directly affect consumption for instance a rule that all cars have to meet very stringent fuel efficiency standards will mean that sports cars disappear almost over night similarly if the price of raw materials such as cotton reflects their environmental impact the idea that you can wear a shirt once and throw it away becomes untenable
3668554 we are looking at a complete redesign of modern life
3668555 culture is moving into a time of restraint and simplicity it will mean the advertising industry including media and marketing just cannot exist in its current form
3668556 advertising will not be able to continue as an industry dedicated to inventing desire
3668557 people will redefine their relationship with brands they will want to hear about genuine innovation not froth advertising will be much more about product
3668558 it was meant to be a cross just for the record but i was pleased to get the goal and it counts just as much as going in from two yards
3668559 when it left my foot i thought it could have a chance and when i saw the keeper struggling i thought it was a goal it went in off the post and i was delighted
3668560 it is a gamble coming here but being who i am i wanted to prove myself here rather than take the easy option elsewhere
3668561 even two years ago we were considered way out there
3668562 now people are coming to us and asking how did you do this
3668563 its just that this is a very practical way to build a number of things on this building are what they used to do its old technology that just makes sense
3668564 we didnt know when that program was going to start or what the requirements were going to be
3668565 it was just a natural outgrowth of what they wanted to do
3668566 the biggest issue on their house was how to capture that view without having a huge energy gain
3668567 the main thing this house is designed on is passive sustainability
3668568 they can live in this house in relative comfort without water or power even if they dont have electricity for some reason the house will stay cool in the summer warm in the winter
3668569 theres no bugs no dirt no heat and humidity the whole attic is a closet
3668570 if we get three quarters of an inch of rain well be topped off on both tanks
3668571 the important thing is were not drawing water from the ground
3668572 there is an initial cost and that is a hurdle for the public
3668573 its the durability and the indoor air quality that adds cost
3668574 most homes that are being built are throwaway homes based on a philosophy adopted in the 1950s theyre like cars theyre supposed to come and go
3668575 it was definitely a challenge a lot of bureaucratic paperwork
3668576 dont build a house larger than you need for every square foot theres an exponential cost

3668581 we had a very productive meeting and we are happy that no decisions have been made and that it is a level playing field in terms of the parent companys considerations of where to site the new factory
3668582 both the council and foxs biscuits have the well being of the staff at the very front of any decision
3668583 we will assist foxs in anyway we can to ensure that their future is in the local area
3668584 they will be making very good money on the upstream side and the question is whether they should have used some of that to keep bills down
3668585 whichever way one looks at it inflation is likely to peak at close to 5 per cent over the coming months probably in september
3668586 the government has not done enough to improve energy efficiency in the home they have not built sufficient gas storage and they havent succeeded in negotiating an open market across the european energy sector

3668595 at the request of the georgian side we introduced a number of amendments which we twice discussed on the telephone with russian president medvedev so we have removed the issue of south ossetias status from the document
3668596 the issue of georgias territorial integrity and the return of refuges the georgian side will make no concessions
3668597 the first is not to resort to the use of force the second is to halt all military action the third is free access to humanitarian aid the fourth is that georgian armed forces should return to their bases the fifth is that russian armed forces should pull back to their positions prior to combat
3668598 the sixth is the beginning of international discussions on the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and on ways to ensure their security
3668599 we came to fight because a northern neighbor wants to suppress a small country we want to tell it no

3668667 it has to be noted that these polling stations are established in countries where botswana has established embassies and consulates all the embassies of the mentioned countries are polling stations save for south africa where a number of the additional polling stations are outside the locations of botswanas embassy in pretoria and the two consulate general offices in johannesburg and cape town
3668668 each country has its own media charges and some of them have high exchange rates such that when one converts into pula it would appear as if more money is used externally for publicity than internally to factor the money used externally with that used internally would represent a falsified juxtaposition of the two financial scenarios for instance in usa an advert put twice in a newspaper for the three weeks registration period cost 12 680 50 which at that time converted into p78 852 41 there are two polling stations in the usa new york and washington dc in other countries such an advert put twice in a newspaper cost 25 654 54 translating into p160 440 00 one has to appreciate currency exchange rates between countries
3668669 even deep in rural areas there are many chinese people working as labourers
3668670 our county does not have a code to guide the practice of fire and safety and rescue he posited adding that in spite of over a decade of t he fire service little has been achieved in delivering safety at the door step of every nigerian
3668671 the absence of a code gives room for quacks and charlatans to take over the practice
3668672 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3668673 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3668674 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3668675 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3668676 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3668677 its going to take some adjustments i was throwing my blue indians socks in a box and a guy said they wear red socks over there
3668678 this trade is more about clearing room to give some of our other players an opportunity giving paul a chance with a contender and providing us some payroll relief
3668679 it just seemed like the right time to add this kind of stabilizer
3668680 you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september because theres very little you can do about it
3668681 was an opportunity without dipping into our farm system to add a veteran starter we can trust
3668682 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3668683 i wasnt a red sox fan this off season put it that way
3668684 it will take a quick adjustment but im eager to play for terry francona and with a talented team with a chance to win it all
3668685 its been a rollercoaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3668686 you play to have all the games count ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3668687 i was shocked because i figured after i cleared waivers a couple weeks ago nobody wanted me
3668688 it is great for everyone to meet the team and this is a much nicer environment to do it because they are relaxed whereas the players can get quite stressed on match days
3668689 it has certainly been a rollercoaster for fans this year this is a way to give something back to the fans and is such a good way to open the season
3668690 why do sydney siders feel compelled to go for morning swims in the ocean during winter
3668691 we are excited with the opportunity of working with moa and marshall

3668701 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3668702 we were saying get in it we dont have very long here
3668703 the tragedy is going to be with us throughout this olympics and even after
3668704 we have to find a way to use it for positives and not let it get us down
3668705 weve coordinated for more than 20 months thats all for this event so we should be focused and concentrate very well this gold is so important to my life
3668706 ten years ago i could get up and nothing was sore i felt strong i felt i could defeat the chinese now its getting more and more complicated so this will be my last olympic games

3668757 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3668759 the long awaited magic bullet cure for cancer hasnt materialized now were thinking more in terms of long term control such as is the case with high blood pressure or diabetes the way to make that happen sooner is to use our current ammunition more affectively
3668760 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3668761 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3668811 the only surprising thing about the debate over dions carbon tariff proposal was to see the federal ndp right there in an unholy marriage of convenience with the conservatives and the free trade negotiators trying to debunk the proposal as
3668812 besides its not the ndp thats off side with the environmental mainstream
3668813 i have always said that a cap and trade system is also a good method of pricing carbon and harnessing the market to reduce emissions and it would be completely compatible with the green shift we believe that both are necessary and complementary but that we can move more quickly on immediately pricing carbon through a green shift while building a real cap and trade system with absolute targets over time that will fit with the emerging plans of the next u s administration and what is already underway in europe

3668839 failed to appreciate the fact that the ongoing ability authority and responsibility to strengthen a label still rest squarely with the drug manufacturer
3668840 to include a warning as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug a causal relationship need not have been proved
3668841 does not make the manufacturers voluntarily strengthened label a violation of federal law which is what it would take to establish an actual conflict between state tort law and federal law
3668842 relatively little weight to the fdas opinion on the preemptive effects of its regulations
3668843 these supplements would describe changes placed into effect to correct concerns about newly discovered risks from the use of the drug
3668844 is appropriate to amend the labeling for an approved product only to reflect newly acquired information to add or strengthen a contraindication warning precaution or adverse reaction only if there is sufficient evidence of a causal association
3668845 data analyses or other information not previously submitted to the agency

3668854 the uk economy continues to slow and the outlook for the rest of 2008 looks gloomy meaning tougher conditions in the labour market

3668870 the irony of the bc carbon tax debate is that the carbon tax revenues actually more than offset the average tax at the bottom for the next year at any rate future budgets could deviate from this objective
3668871 the canadian press canwest news service cbc radio and tv ctv globaltv and la presse canadienne covered a new report saying the average canadian would see a 50 per cent income tax cut if the federal government phased in a new tax to crack down on activities that contribute to global warming the authors environmentalist david suzuki and sfus mark jaccard

3669113 the search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness
3669114 one cannot divine nor forecast the conditions that will make happiness one only stumbles upon them
3669115 we are never happy we can only remember that we were so once
3669116 ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so
3669117 happiness is a mystery like religion and should never be rationalised

3669152 it is crucial for service providers to understand the penetration of key enabling technologies in order to decide whether and when they should be scaling up the use of mdm in their businesses what is clear is that we are now at a critical point in terms of adoption of this key technology service providers looking to offer device management services based on oma dm should find they have a good choice of handsets across a range of price points
3669153 firmware updating is by no means the only application of oma dm that service providers are interested in oma dm is already being used for more sophisticated types of device configuration than oma cp is capable of such as continuous provisioning in conjunction with automatic detection it is handling client provisioning for new value added services being offered by operators and supporting important commercial functionality such as preferred roaming lists

3669175 dalla mia natura sono venuti fuori una selvaggia disperazione un abbandono al dolore pietoso da guardare furore terribile e impotente amarezza e sdegno angoscia che piangeva a gran voce infelicit che non riusciva a trovare sfogo dolore muto non potevo sopportare che le mie sofferenze fossero senza significato ora trovo nascosto da qualche parte della mia natura qualcosa che mi dice che niente al mondo senza significato e meno di tutto la sofferenza

3669190 to worry today when the danger is obviously climate change and not over isolation just seems perverse
3669191 i am suggesting here that climate change might be a small price to pay for the benefits of industrial society
3669192 lets turn to the next chapter hello climate change goodbye industrial society as well as the rest of society including all the individuals
3669193 the language of catastrophe is not the language of science
3669194 even if climate change is exaggerated certain things that are enjoined by the green movement would be practical and prudent
3669195 the question is what things can we preserve without a disaster which will affect as always the poorest people in the world most
3669196 as jean says its impossible to universalize the current western use of energy
3669197 but in the short term there are famines there are famines right now
3669198 the struggle for equity within the human species must take second place to the struggle for the survival of an intact and functioning biosphere
3669199 aha so as more people come to live as we do you think people will figure out what to do about the mess as they come to create it
3669200 the very same thing could be said in response to your worries about people trying to avert global warming
3669201 excessive isolation if it ever comes to be a problem is certainly more reversible than depletion of resources drought etc
3669202 the fact is there is no risk im going to wind up a hermit whereas there is a risk the worlds resources are going to be depleted
3669203 the measures that the environmental movement proposes to combat global warming are counter productive
3669204 most environmentalists affirm that we that is humanity must reduce our consumption of fossil fuels do you agree with that affirmation
3669205 while we are busy being self sufficient we reduce the means available to develop new ways of exploiting resources therefore the more we retreat from industrial society the fewer resources we have available
3669206 one reason i believe them is that otherwise id have to suppose a giant conspiracy to impose the idea of global warming on the public and a conspiracy with what purpose
3669207 industrial inter dependence is reaching a state of transparent inefficiency and all the while it has begun to erode the
3669208 these political philosophies dont merely represent sectarian identities but analytical frameworks that in the past have engaged people and connected world events to their day to day existence that is to say that at the heart of environmentalisms ascendancy may be a vacuum of philosophical ideas
3669209 i sense that if it were bush instead of gore who was making known the recent work of reputable scientists you might be more objective
3669210 a little more detachment when considering scientific matters is called for science is not a political subject
3669211 per ambizione ma per toccare il sublime per innalzare il luogo comune sino alla sacralit di oggetti resi radiosi dal lento smalto del tempo

3669251 its fairly clear that the labour market is deteriorating at a rapid pace and i think its going to continue to do so because of slower economic growth and concerns by companies that the downturn might actually be longer and more pronounced than they originally thought
3669252 with rpi inflation reaching 5 in july an acceleration in pay growth cannot be ruled out and even if it stays subdued the mpc has plenty of other inflation concerns which are likely to keep rates on hold for another couple of months at least
3669253 i cant believe it the len is have been taken off the seven wonders shortlist all because the local government wouldnt pay the 320 reales 199 registration fee
3669254 you see theyre voting for seven new world wonders and the len is national park was on the website but the government which spends millions of reales on parties and local events wouldnt pay the registration fee it looks as if rio de janeiros sugar loaf mountain will be entered instead
3669255 without an official supporting committee osc a nominee cannot participate in the next stages of the new 7 wonders of nature campaign
3669256 there is no registration fee just go ahead vote and create an osc
3669257 we introduced the nominal registration fee to make sure that the osc for each nominee were serious and committed and it also helps us defray the administrative costs as a non profit organisation which has never received any public funding or taxpayers monies whatsoever we must not only be as fiscally careful as we can but must also ask the actual beneficiaries of the campaign to contribute at least a bit to the administrative costs
3669258 has had a varied career as a filmmaker museum curator aviator and explorer
3669259 so far we have made enough money to cover our main costs which is very positive since many good ideas often fall apart because of insufficient funding and it is our intention to continue to grow our revenues in the future for example through sponsor and licensing partnerships and indeed to make much more so that we can generate a surplus to support the important objectives of the new7wonders foundation

3669269 our research points to an ancient seasonal timing mechanism that survives in modern vertebrates some humans may retain remnants of this ancient seasonal timing mechanism which would explain why they experience sad

3669492 i would like to see the b reactor preserved because i would like that story to be told
3669493 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3669494 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3669495 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3669496 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3669497 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3669498 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3669499 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3669500 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3669501 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3669502 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful

3669519 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3669520 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3669521 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3669522 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3669525 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3669526 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3669527 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3669528 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3669529 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3669530 dear lazy web are sony memory stick ms and memory stick pro msp ubuntu friendly
3669531 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3669532 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3669551 we placed our participants in an fmri scanner to measure their brain activity while we first showed our subject short 3s movie clips of an actor sipping from a cup and then looking disgusted
3669552 later on we asked them to read and imagine short emotional scenarios for instance walking along a street bumping into a reeking drunken man who then starts to retch and realizing that some of his vomit had ended up in your own mouth finally we measured their brain activity while the participants tasted unpleasant solutions in the scanner
3669553 is that in all three cases the same location of the anterior insula lit up the anterior insula is the part of the brain that is the heart of our feeling of disgust patients who have damage to the insula because of a brain infection for instance lose this capacity to feel disgusted if you give them sour milk they would drink it happily and say it tastes like soda
3669554 what this means is that whether we see a movie or read a story the same thing happens we activate our bodily representations of what it feels like to be disgusted and that is why reading a book and viewing a movie can both make us feel as if we literally feel what the protagonist is going through

3669564 its the perfect recession product to have in the marketplace
3669565 it plays very well in the mobile marketplace it plays in emerging markets it plays into peoples desire to have a second pc or one for the kids thats low cost yet still capable
3669566 well know kind of in six months how much of this demand is real and how much is customers thinking theyre going to win in the marketplace and double ordering
3669567 it seems to be growing the market rather than cannibalizing existing pc sales

3669576 we are harnessing technology that enables us to be anywhere and be live from anywhere
3669577 technology is allowing us to pare down to that one person who can deliver the product
3669578 given how much more splintered the audience is and the different ways that you all are getting your news its hard to have the same infrastructure that we had 25 years ago
3669579 not that long ago one person couldnt go out and do the shooting the reporting and the feeding of video into new york there are easy ways to do so now the technology and the demand have come together to make these one person bureaus realistic

3669588 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3669589 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes

3669610 demographic targeting has been around for as long as advertising has been in existence but now with so many application developers using our system we can take it to the next stage and show much more relevant ads to our users
3669611 vertical ad networks have a great opportunity to better address advertisers and publishers needs by offering something different from the typical banners which are being ignored by users because they compete for attention with the core content that users are consuming

3669617 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3669618 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3669619 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3669620 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3669621 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3669622 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3669638 it fall in crude prices is a happy sign it is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic retail prices

3669640 our retail prices are pegged much lower current international crude prices there is no scope for reduction in petrol and diesel prices as of now

3669647 we were able to get one of the passengers from the back of the van out onto the road but the others were certainly very seriously injured
3669648 there was no one else just motorbike my digital camera and me i rode from delhi to ladakh it was a 16 day trip

3669651 none of the photographs have been touched up in photographs the colours of ladakh change every half an hour
3669652 i have been to ladakh several times but i cannot say whether it is my wanderlust or love for photography that takes me across the country
3669653 the ibaf has been advised of a possible anti doping rule violation by a player from the taiwan team
3669654 as a result the player chang tai shan has been provisionally suspended pending the analysis of the b sample and a formal hearing
3669655 we learned about the news yesterday afternoon and it is very regrettable
3669656 i have already notified all the players on our team and told them that since now we only have 23 players we should give an even better performance during the games
3669657 i feel today they did their job and did a good job
3669658 the medications are not illegal but theyre banned for olympics athletes
3669659 im not clear on what happened im not a doctor
3669660 it would take much more than 50 km to realise what i did
3669661 in the situation i was in not being able to do the tour de i was really motivated
3669662 i worked very hard for this and it paid off i pictured myself on the top step but this is brilliant
3669663 she told me my time would come at the next olympics and i would win gold
3669664 i promised to work extra hard if i win she will be jumping up and down and i wish i could be there to see those emotions
3669665 the 1 500 gold medal would be amazing thats the one ive been dreaming about since 2005
3669666 it would mean my career has been really successful and i would be very satisfied

3669671 i feel like im getting stronger and faster i think im actually 22 when im really 33
3669672 we knew that sudan was the team to beat in group c
3669673 it all worked out nicely today i started with three attackers because we wanted the three points
3669674 we probably lack a little bit of experience at the mtn africa cup of nations level
3669675 we will learn from today im an optimist and with two more games to go everything is still possible
3669676 we missed a lot of chances while zambia took the chances which were offered by us two goals came as a result of mistakes
3669677 we didnt play as well as we could sudan dominated the midfield luckily our defence kept cool and our goalkeeper kennedy mweene was excellent today were not happy with our performance but were of course happy with the win we scored the goals today and thats what counts in football
3669678 sudan is difficult to play against as nobody really knows them

3669684 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3669685 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3669686 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3669687 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am

3669744 on the eve of the decision by the sa reserve banks monetary policy committee with regard to interest rate adjustments the trade union still contends that other options should be considered to bring inflation under control
3669745 further interest rate hikes will only be detrimental to the economy and could lead to a situation of stagflation
3669746 stagflation usually follows in instances where a certain crisis such as the power crisis in south africa leads to increased prices which could give rise to less profitable production levels
3669747 it is vested in the idea that inflation is increased by an increased amount of money in circulation which influences the ability of the economy to make sufficient provision
3669748 the consumer is footing the bill production has also decreased while the producers because of the higher sales prices of items make sufficient profit even if fewer items are produced
3669749 if supply surpasses demand prices will decrease south africa should now focus on expanding infrastructure and assist its people to be more productive

3669756 a strong and athletic infielder with a classic left handed swing hes drawn a comparison to wally joyner in terms of his offensive skill set
3669757 however scouts feel flahertys range is not good enough for him to stay at the premium position into the pros and he will most likely have to make a move to second base which he played for team usa last summer at the plate flaherty swings from the left side and will hit for average he holds the commodores record for longest hitting streak at 35 games flaherty hit six total home runs in his first two years on campus and has close to doubled that total this season he has showed signs of filling out his lanky 6 foot 3 frame and more strength is projected but he will most likely never be considered a power hitter his athleticism and makeup are a plus and should carry him into the major leagues

3669810 famously well famously in wolverhampton anyway wolves failed to secure any cut of subsequent transfer fees paid for robbie keane when they sold him to coventry
3669811 as robbie has featured in yet another multi million pound transfer this typically molineuxesque incompetence has lost the club a sizeable chunk of income but which lower league team has been most astute in the sell on practise
3669812 first subsequent transfer immediately following the clause being drawn up not for all future revenues for the rest of the players career
3669813 six hundred times greater than our record outlay on a player

3669815 going in to the last day of the first season forest were promoted and stanley was on the bench stuck on 24 goals for some unknown reason frank clark sent him on with 20 minutes to go and within a minute or two hed scored and cost the club another half a million the second installment came and went but i believe after his second season with forest which was also his last he was called up to the england squad and played only to be sold to liverpool a week or two later another half million paid out for nowt
3669816 i was wondering who is the oldest player ever to turn pro
3669817 i remember tony book being something like 29 when he signed for manchester city but he may have been a pro in non league football before that
3669818 paul first played for us in 1995 as a 21 year old when we were a northern premier league club and came back to us at the same level in 2000
3669819 the club turned professional for the 2004 05 season when paul was 30 he made his football league debut in august 2006 aged 32 so far hes played 411 games for stanley a club record and scored 186 goals
3669820 i believe that made him the oldest professional debutant since the war
3669821 i cant remember the circumstances behind him playing at cardiff if memory serves but no doubt it was due to a wafer thin squad
3669822 when clubs had to be voted in to the league players had to decide whether to give up their day jobs and go full time
3669823 this happened to a relative mick worswick who was in his mid 30s in 1978 when wigan joined the league but who had a job with much better pay and prospects than fourth division wages i would guess this era would be where the oldest player to turn pro would be found or perhaps when professionalism was introduced in 1882

3669874 we went through a rigorous interview process and scott stood out among the other candidates as being a great communicator and providing structure to his team accountability in the locker room and disciplined play

3669876 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation

3669881 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3669882 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3669883 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3669884 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3669885 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3669886 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3669887 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
