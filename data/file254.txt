2540003 sounds nice but it is not a market reality only an obama sound byte
2540004 but obama is a pure marxist he doan even nod at socialism on the way to his radical saul alinsky style marxism
2540005 the problem fer liberals as distinct from loons is that they know theys in a corner over obama they need some sly way out so heh they will find ways to undermine the campaign jes wait and see how many more of this sorta thang shows up
2540006 how we got here was the inaction of this congress
2540007 i cannot blame you for declaring yourself no longer a demoncrat they did disinfranchise yall and will do so anytime they see fit theyre the ruling class not public servants but they count on your vote without delivering anything
2540008 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2540009 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2540010 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2540011 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2540012 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2540013 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2540014 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2540015 the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way

2540017 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2540018 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2540019 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2540020 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2540021 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2540022 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2540023 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2540028 we expect redesigned macbooks and macbook pros and a new ipod touch
2540029 piper jaffray believes apple will increase the capacity of the ipod shuffles as well as the ipod nanos but maintain current price points redesigned form factors for the shuffles and nanos are unlikely we believe the ipod touch may be redesigned and may enter the 199 price point in line with the iphone
2540030 while there has been some speculation that apple will introduce a portable mac based on the multitouch technology in the iphone and ipod touch we do not believe apple will release such a device in september
2540031 while we do believe apple is currently testing some form of macbook touch using a touchscreen as the primary input we currently believe this is more likely a 2010 event
2540032 rather we believe a smaller version of the 13 inch macbook air is likely in the 2009 time frame

2540086 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia

2540093 kalau ayah tidak pergi bagaimana aku bisa mendapat baju yang cantik
2540094 kalau ayah tidak pergi aku kan tidak bisa memiliki perhiasan yang indah
2540095 ayah mengerti mengapa kau merasa cemas melepas ayah pergi tapi percayalah ayah bisa menjaga diri
2540096 oooh seandainya aku menjadi burung tentu aku bisa lebih cepat menyusul ayah
2540097 saya kebetulan sedang lewat burung itu yang menunjukkan bapak kepada saya rupanya bapak telah menjadi korban perampok

2540103 im in the process of doing invisible man right now and im working with some conceptual artists in tandem with writing the script im actually working with one of the artists from batman begins and the dark knight so it could be magneto or it could be the invisible man next
2540104 my take is kind of an extrapolation it actually deals with a nephew of the first character its got some of the characters from the h g wells book but its kind of a continuation
2540105 it involves scotland yard getting their hands on the current invisible man and basically saying wow youd be a really good secret agent to send into imperial russia right now it starts off from there
2540106 o jogo chave do brasil ser contra a china enfrentaremos outras quatro equipes grandes e teremos que surpreender ao menos uma delas para passar fase seguinte
2540107 what im really happy about is that by taking the mummy out of egypt and putting it in china by exploring a different approach to the quest for immortality we now have it clear that the mummy franchise can travel now we know that if we want to go to mexico or we want to go to peru we can because theres a cultural truth there of the mummies and these beautiful cultures
2540108 they have a lot of mummies the aztec culture had a lot of mummies and some of their mummy designs for the foundation army were taken from mexican mummies that they have found so i think that somehow that might make the basis of a good story
2540109 i hadnt done a comedy for a while and thought pineapple express would be fun and funny

2540120 over the next several weeks we will live together work together and train together this is an invaluable opportunity to get to know and understand one another to learn about different cultures and to build enduring relationships between professional militaries
2540121 the main task of georgian officers and soldiers is training this international exercise is a unique case as we have the possibility to hold trainings along with the representatives of the best army in the world for a month i think that we have created a new military school in georgia in recent years believe that what all of you have learned now will remain in our country and will be shared with the future generations that is why we have to train theoretically and practically as this is a precondition of victory the main thing is to get acquainted with independent decision making and free thinking
2540122 it is in a spirit of partnership for peace part of the nato program it was very rewarding for me to see the joint work of soldiers from different countries the command post trainings also went successfully ukrainian azeri armenian and georgian soldiers participated in the exercise jointly i believe that the exercise fulfilled its main purpose
2540123 enjoy the opening ceremonies since they wont win any medals
2540124 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2540125 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2540126 i would welcome participating in a paternity test im only one side of the test but im happy to participate in one

2540137 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2540138 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2540139 even if the jets arent good they become that much more interesting to watch in new york if nowhere else
2540140 compared to what theyve had they now have something to watch
2540141 new yorks ratings could go up 15 and 15 of a 10 million person market is a nice chunk
2540142 it will improve it by some percentage and some percentage of the new york market is just big numbers so the advertisers have to be ecstatic
2540143 abuse one of the nurses walked in on him he was up on the bed straddling mr davis and punching him in the face
2540144 hes fine physically only one small bruise on his chin but imagine what the poor old guy was thinking being attacked that way
2540145 yes and charged with assault but hell probably get off on some kind of mental breakdown excuse and be ordered to take counseling
2540146 thats one rotten egg out of here but i fear there may be others
2540147 no not a hundred percent sure but from the different things shes said i think its a woman
2540148 see this is what comes from always having a shortage of staff and aides having to do shifts alone when there are two the job isnt just easier but theres less chance of abuse because someones there to see and some people just arent cut out for this type of work you have to be both physically and mentally strong remember a while back when gary was punching you in the hallway that day and the reporter guy saw it he asked if you received combat pay and when you laughed and said no he said you should you never lost your cool with gary
2540149 that had more to do with compassion than mental strength if i was eighty or ninety and my family stuck me in a nursing facility so they could sell my home and everything else i owned id want to punch someone too
2540150 oh poo he was a bully way before that ever happened he was terribly abusive to his wife before she passed away hes as right in his mind as you or i and hes physically strong hes just a bully pure and simple always was and always will be but youre right about the compassion without that well you know
2540151 yeah i know and i also know that i need to get off my duff and back to work i still have katie to shower and a couple of others before bedtime i still cant believe joe did that theres no excuse for it i just wish wed have more in depth in service meetings on recognizing and handling burnout and other emotional stress on the job
2540152 so do i but wed most likely still have incidences like this one all the training in the world wont help if the person doesnt seek help when they need it
2540153 talk to you later im alone tonight so cant take a full supper break
2540154 guys like heath have faced pressure before and have been successful so they expect success
2540155 he was a very intense player but he had a calmness about him it was pretty easy to see that he had that quality very early whatever it is hes got it
2540156 we gotta clear a path i yelled in to the chaos my truck was down blown in half i rushed to the m2 and started spraying in to the oncomeing fire and told the driver to punch it the commander jumped in to the shotgun seat and we made our way around the flameing wreakage of our lead vehicle
2540157 you have nine lives troop and that was three of em
2540158 why is always seem to go that you dont know what you got til its gone you pave paradise and put up a parking lot
2540159 power has been given to me to be able to come against the christians in a short time
2540160 i want to make war against the true christians those that serve god with the hearts their lives and their actions not only in name well see if they will be able to stand up against me well see i am a warrior i fight against christ
2540161 it will not be long before i will declare war against the christians i myself will fight with all my strength
2540162 do you really think im dead i just played dead because i did not want christ to be mad at me in a short time though i will be allowed to fight against the christians in this country
2540163 i was given power on earth to fight against all those that serve and do the work of god i have succeeded in destroying some and others i have taken prisoner in a short time i will be allowed to fight against you and others like you

2540165 lets be friends and ill help you get that dumb donkey
2540166 dont worry about the lion little donkey turns out hes a guy a went to school with nice guy lets all go to my country house and have a drink
2540167 i will keep you safe if you turn back to me and calm down
2540168 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
2540169 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2540170 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2540171 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2540172 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2540173 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2540174 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2540175 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2540176 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2540177 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2540178 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2540179 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2540180 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2540181 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2540182 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2540183 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2540184 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
2540185 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
2540186 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2540187 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2540188 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2540189 i think most people today know this is just a story
2540190 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2540191 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
2540192 i was never put on the conveyor belt of always made my own path
2540193 i do only what is absolutely required to be considered normal
2540194 i keep hearing compliments about the ancient culture of the jewish people and the old tradition
2540195 and about the ability to build a modern country out of them in a span of 60 years these comparisons make the chinese feel close to us they too have a glorious tradition and they too are trying to develop a modern country quickly they feel that they have something to learn from us
2540196 only recently a large team of chinese state television employees visited israel for a period of three weeks to research the israeli miracle now they are visiting several places in the world that used to have large jewish communities in order to examine the jewish communitys influence on its surroundings their idea is to try to decipher the secret of the jews success
2540197 yeah one sec while i pull out my hot nurse outfit
2540198 sit at my right hand till i make your enemies your footstool
2540199 dear lord make my enemies my footstool lord make the ones who dont like me or the ones who despise me realize that theyre wrong
2540200 you killed the author of life but god raised him from the dead and we are a witness of this fact
2540201 through faith in the name of jesus this man was healed
2540202 he jumped up stood on his feet and began to walk then walking leaping and praising god
2540203 but an angel of the lord came at night opened the gates of the jail and brought them out
2540204 the father alone has the authority to set those dates and times and they are not for you to know but you will recieve power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses telling people about me everywhere
2540205 people are going to take advantage of me and make me do everything and treat me like a 5 year old
2540206 jeez lady youre like 45 and you dont know how society works
2540207 prime minister john howard says the standard of literacy and numeracy being taught in australian schools is insufficient
2540208 i dont think at the moment we have sufficiently high standards in relation to basic literacy and numeracy
2540209 to the extent that we at a commonwealth level can provide leadership in doing that then i think that is a very good thing
2540210 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2540211 its really sad after the celebration of the opening ceremonies which were the best opening ceremonies ive ever been at
2540212 to the best of my knowledge this is a random action and not targeted at americans its just that you dont expect something to happen in a country like this

2540214 im saddened but that doesnt make me think any less of this country

2540263 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2540264 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2540265 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2540266 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2540267 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2540268 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2540269 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling

2540313 this apparently non symbolic objective character of technical images leads whoever looks at them to see them not as images but as windows
2540314 they are not windows but images they have a magical effect and they entice those receiving them to project this undecoded magic onto the world out there
2540315 this person is smiling in this particular way therefore she is attempting to be seductive
2540316 technical images absorb the whole of history and form a collective memory going endlessly round in circles

2540318 to recognize the studium is inevitably to encounter the photographers intentions to enter into harmony with them to approve or disapprove of them but always to understand them to argue them within oneself for culture from which the studium derives is a contract arrived at between creators and consumers 27 28
2540319 many photos are alas inert under my gaze most provoke only a general polite interest they have no punctum in them they please or displease me w o pricking me they are invested with no more than studium
2540320 we can speak then of a generalized inclusive archive a shadow archive that encompasses an entire social terrain while positioning individuals within that terrain
2540321 look up at ones betters and a look down of ones inferiors
2540322 this is devastating news because they were so looking forward to fighting each other unfortunately injuries happen and i look forward to serra recovering quickly and to getting him back into the octagon

2540337 the drug that makes up what is carelessly referred to as salt is actually sodium chloride or nacl a chemical compound of sodium and chloride
2540338 used mainly as a seasoning or preservative additive a regular intake of nacl comes with much addressed health risks
2540339 is that sodium is everywhere not just on top of our french fries but in our drinks in our soups on our meats saltines are practically crackers made of salt
2540340 there is really no more need for salt in our diet
2540341 the method of food preservation once was salting and pickling but todays newest methods of freezing canning and air locking products for later consumption have opened new doors healthier doors
2540342 for the good of humanity i mean the ocean is just filled with salt we thought it would be a great humanitarian gesture by the company

2540359 do you think i like denying health care to underprivileged children or plunging the country deeper and deeper into debt well i dont and i hope someday youll understand that in the meantime im asking the american people to try to meet me halfway on this
2540360 we want to believe that hes finally going to be the president we always wanted but weve given him so many chances
2540361 i dont think we can handle another disappointment maybe its time to realize that president bush will never be the head of state we need him to be
2540362 he seemed so sincere this time he wouldnt abuse his executive powers if he didnt care about us right

2540373 the need for change is stronger and more urgent than ever before and only you the people standing here today and indeed all the people of this great nation only you can deliver this change
2540374 every time its the same exact spiel i need change i want change whys he so eager for all this change whats he going to do with it anyway
2540375 and of course after telling us all about how he had the ability to magically fix everything he went right back to asking for change typical
2540376 if hes really looking for change hes got the wrong guy
2540377 i saw him walk in and i knew he was headed straight for our table
2540378 he just stood there smiling at us for a while and asked how our food tasted then he went and did the same thing at the next table over the nerve of some people
2540379 ill be honest when that black guy said he would stop at nothing to get change it kind of scared me
2540380 i told him id give him some if i saw him later even though i probably wont
2540381 im a hardworking american who pays his taxes and the last thing i need is some guy on the street demanding change from me
2540382 we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2540383 some caused by nature some caused by human weakness and some most recently cased by desire for sensationalism and profit without any regard for the human consequences
2540384 es gab ein geregeltes zeltlagerleben mit fahnenmast wobei verhaltensweisen und lebensformen aus der zeit des nationalsozialismus praktiziert wurden
2540385 i thought to myself im not on fire but im smoldering that ordeal made me a tougher man
2540386 that was the biggest gut check ive ever seen in my life on another human being
2540387 the investigation revealed no discriminatory behavior nor any pattern of racial bias in the decision making and communication of the unt football coaching staff nor any within the football program as a whole
2540388 throughout my first time at north texas i met some of my best friends here
2540389 it seems like yesterday but it set the tone for where i was headed and i always kept my family in mind
2540390 he said he had no idea we had these facilities
2540391 as a football coach you have to believe you can win i know we can win because north texas has won before
2540392 i am very very close to him and i wanted him to get a chance to see me play college football
2540393 when i was offered this job and put all my thoughts and prayers and talked to my family about taking this job i knew what i was leaving
2540394 i knew what job i was taking and i knew turning this around wouldnt happen overnight
2540395 we had a chance to win at the end but things happen for a reason im so proud of this football team but its going to be a tough pill to swallow tomorrow
2540396 we dont want to be a team of coulda woulda shouldas
2540397 but you have a choice as a coach you can throw your hands up and say this is what we are i dont believe in that at all i really want our players to see what my coaching staff sees in them were trying to bottle up the successes that weve had
2540398 you want to make sure that they understand how it works and what it feels like when youre executing
2540399 i think its important for the progress of this young football team and this young offense that you point out thats the way it can go
2540400 i told riley with tr nicked up that we were going to put the ball in his hands
2540401 rileys a playmaker he wants the ball in his hands when we put the ball in his hands magics going to happen
2540402 i feel confident that when my football team steps on the field theyre going to leave it on the line

2540417 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2540418 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2540419 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2540420 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2540421 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2540422 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2540423 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2540424 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2540450 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach

2540501 dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go

2540505 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2540506 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2540507 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2540508 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2540509 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2540510 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
2540511 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2540512 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy

2540515 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2540516 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards

2540525 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

2540528 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
2540529 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

2540583 held that a nonviolent boycott is legitimate when when we are required to compromise with what we believe to be an untruth but he felt that it would be a dangerous thing if we were to adopt social boycott when there are differences of opinion
2540584 summary use of social boycott in order to bend a minority to the will of the majority is a species of unpardonable violence we may not make people pure by compulsion much less may we compel them by violence to respect our opinion keep in mind here that gandhi was not simply speaking to physical violence but more importantly violence of the heart and mind it is utterly against the spirit of democracy we want to cultivate i t would be wisdom to err on the right side and to exercise the weapon even in the limited sense on rare and well defined occasions

2540618 everyone was so surprised to see norris pull through they wanted to touch him in order to confirm to themselves he really was alive and well
2540619 you would never know he was injured at all except he walks with a limp and uses a cane for balance
2540620 you know how hard headed guys can be he thinks he is still bulletproof he is doing his own therapy on his bad leg and foot by making them work and the muscles are slowly coming back
2540621 being a military wife for one thing and having faith in god is a large part of it as well all soldiers especially those who deploy to a war zone are told they may not come back of course they believe it wont be them being loaded into a helicopter on a stretcher but they accept dying more than those of us in the general public that acceptance of the inevitable i guess has a lot do to with how we handle these sorts of things
2540622 all i can tell them is that maybe god wanted them to come home
2540623 for some reason and we may never know for sure what that reason is god wanted norris to continue living on this earth
2540624 i know people get tired of me when i get on my soap box but we cant let the general public forget what these men and women have done and are still doing

2540639 other political leaders said they would also not like to be part of the delegation if we had to be out but we persuaded them that it is a good opportunity to talk to the samiti leaders and it should not be lost

2540644 in the departments view customizing the number of hours days weeks and years attributed to a working life on an industry specific basis most closely hews to congresss intent in directing the secretary to set standards based upon the best available evidence and upon consideration of the latest available scientific data
2540645 those numerical quantities are meaningful only in the context of some distribution that arises when variability and uncertainty are taken into consideration a central estimate and a risk range might be misleading in situations when sensitive populations are of primary concern
2540646 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

2540661 nfs is getting pressure from clustered file systems like lustre and gpfs as well as custom file systems produced by web 2 0 service providers such as google gfs
2540662 even for files too small to stripe those files can be distributed across multiple nfs servers which provides statistical load balancing
2540663 with a capable cluster of nfs servers and a back end file system files or ranges within files can be relocated transparent to the applications accessing data over pnfs
2540664 pnfs moves the metadata server out of the data transfer path
2540665 instead of having to deal with a number of competing proprietary and open source parallel file systems pnfs will allow users to reap the benefits of parallel storage systems by choosing best of breed solutions without having concerns over vendor lock in
2540666 for environments that need improved performance for large sequential files where parallel access is needed pnfs has some legs moving forward
2540667 however not every environment or application needs parallel access to data
2540668 for mainstream markets pnfs will most likely remain a niche at least near term being used for specialized applications and environments
2540669 the big benefactors of pnfs will be the parallel file systems like those from ibm sun ibrix and others as well as proprietary storage systems like those from panasas
2540670 the architecture for the pnfs proposal was derived from the panasas directflow parallel protocol which is a core component utilized by the panasas panfs parallel file system
2540671 the directflow protocol used in our activestor parallel storage clusters currently provides essentially all of the functionality expected to be available in the nfs 4 1 later this year

2540675 they wanted to bring some closure to the region the region has suffered
2540676 by the most direct route through buffalo niagara falls and windsor making stops at other small towns along the way
2540677 each time the mayor opted to drive back sometimes to enjoy the company of family members but other times because he simply enjoys the solitude of driving
2540678 each trip was court approved within the court approved timeframe albeit through different jurisdictions and was the most direct route back to detroit
2540679 i dont know what the circumstances were but i cant imagine that this is a problem
2540680 the mayor was approved for a business trip to upper new york state in mid july so this may be related i dont think this a matter where anyone is thinking he was getting away with anything
2540681 i think its a situation that the authorities will take a close look at to see if true and if he was given permission
2540682 he was only asked where are you going and when are you coming back there was no requirement to explain how are you getting there how are you getting back
2540683 he may have gone through niagara falls on the way back i believe the most direct route back to detroit is driving through canada
2540684 he saw me staring at him and i said mayor kilpatrick he got up and shook my hand
2540685 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree

2540688 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2540689 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2540690 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2540713 the creature has always been out there and its out there still

2540715 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2540716 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2540717 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2540718 i think most people today know this is just a story
2540719 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2540720 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2540721 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2540722 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2540723 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2540724 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2540725 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2540726 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2540727 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2540728 d tente was looking forward to playing the festival and continue s to support this great organization who has worked so hard at keeping the metal scene alive in barcelona
2540729 the original d tente four song demo recorded in 1985 generated such excitement in the extreme metal scene that uks kerrang magazine called d tente the most promising band to emerge from the thrash genre mastered and available for the first time this recording has been coupled with the demo recording from the post d tente band catalepsy catalepsy featured the d tente songwriting duo of steve hochheiser and ross robinson as well as machine head s dave mcclain on drums critics praised catalepsy as one of the first progressive thrash bands and as the natural evolution of d tente

2540731 thousands of california families have educated their children through home schooling

2540756 when i started in comedy in the clubs in 1977 blacks couldnt do certain clubs not because they were segregated they just didnt want to put the black comics out there in los angeles the clubs would have a black night people would say why dont you come by and do something i would say im a comedian dont put a title on me dont limit yourself how you start is how you finish

2540768 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2540769 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see
2540770 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2540771 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2540772 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2540773 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking
2540774 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2540775 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2540776 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2540777 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2540778 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2540779 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about

2540791 naked blonde walks into a bar with a poodle under one arm and a two foot salami under the other
2540792 cameron just asked for it to be bigger thought of you
2540793 at first it was pretty awkward and none of them seemed like they were really into it
2540794 but then the drummer comes in and right after that the bass player comes in and it was like yes soundgarden is back it was so intense
2540795 i got all the way there but then i just didnt know if i could do it
2540796 i had a huge lunch that day and cinnabon thats some really sugary stuff even if you have a sweet tooth like me
2540797 all i saw was this bare chested guy entering the store and thats unacceptable in the food service industry i hate to be the enforcer but just because we were in a band together doesnt mean i can allow him to create an unhygienic environment
2540798 when you watch the other teams who are experienced with international ball they initiate their offensive sets about six to eight feet back from the three point line their wing shooters hover a good three to four feet back from the line the us however like good nba players initiate their offense at or a few feet behind the three point line their wings toe it this is especially the case with slash minded players like anthony wade james and bryant in the nba this is fine the wider arc of the 3 point line adds another 6 feet to the space within it giving penetrators more room to operate and generating greater spacing but the international arc is so much shorter when a player penetrates the help defense has three or four fewer feet to cover to collapse on them watching the games at times it does seem amazing how quickly the defenses will jam penetration and attack post players when redd is on the floor he actually sits where the normal three point line is and that does help the spacing and our half court offense deron willams and paul are also adept at making their moves well outside the three point line probably because as point guards they are a little more used to making moves further out using as much floor as they can to create space on their defender hopefully theyll figure that out it would help dwight howard greatly on defense this team ballhawks too damn much all of em a team can support one ballhawk maybe two but when all of the guys are chasing the ball there are too many open shots i still dont think were going to lose but some disciplined team is going to make us pay and keep it close that team will be spain
2540799 back door screens still kill team usa and though the men still have the athleticism to recover and sometimes make up for it coach ks crew is still getting beat way too much by teams using team usas pressure against itself
2540800 cest celui qui ne peut que se gratter la moiti du dos
2540801 two four six eight ten twelve fourteen sixteen eightteen points
2540802 those two are really powerful i cant believe those idiots are that strong
2540803 its scary that those two are that strong i can only imagine how much more powerful trent chan could be if he used his earth magic
2540804 hm this gives me an idea trent stay back im going to use one of master angs ki attacks
2540805 we need to move brother is going to use a ki attack that his master taught him i never seen what it is but i heard that is powerful
2540806 it was master trent who sent me up here for you oh here comes the monster
2540807 damn one got away oh well we did a lot of damage today
2540808 that was something i didnt expect you two to be so battle ready
2540809 thats what training is for to get oneself ready for battle situations and besides that looks at trent that was the first time we used the chimera techinique in battle it went smoothly
2540810 sort of thats just the name we decided to call it because our sword styles are so different we combined them to create that techinique but the name chimera was just an idea because my style is called viper sword style brothers style is that of the bear blade style thats why his blade is big and my sword is odd shaped they match our styles viper style specializes in stabs jabs and piercings brothers style is more about power and strength
2540811 wow that is cool i like the names of the styles but do you guys have the characteristics of the animals that the styles are named after
2540812 i can move quickly like a snake and strike just as fast i dont know about brother but alot of the girls in our village called him a ben glares at trent trent gulps ill leave that for another day
2540813 if you wont say i will the girls called him the villages big teddy bear though he is strong he
2540814 big teddy bear like those little stuffed animal toys that little kids play with looks at ben he was like that i find it hard to believe
2540815 same here are you sure that that is what they called him freakshow
2540816 as sure as the sun shines tomahawk if you continue calling me
2540817 what was the spell that you used earlier to form that large wave that destroyed those airships ben san
2540818 it wasnt a spell it was a techinique spells use ki and mana techiniques like my energy wave only use ki
2540819 so its a loophole that you exploit as long as it doesnt use both ki and mana its not a spell and youre not classified as a magic user interesting idea coming from a backwater idiot from akamaru

2540821 eu fui chamado por jeff katzenberg que era o cabe a do est dio na poca quando estava preparando o filme
2540822 eu tenho ou a melhor ou a pior id ia do mundo eddie murphy disse que mataria para estar num filme de
2540823 isso algo interessante a primeira vez que ou o falar disso mas o fato que a id ia n o saiu do papel n s est vamos procurando us lo como um humano engra ado que interegisse com o pessoal do espa o n o poder amos seguir com um trabalho que n o satisfizesse a n s e nem a ele ent o eu imaginava que ele concordasse com isso que fosse um personagem que j tivesse interpretado antes isso muito interessante n o tinha id ia de que ele estava procurando interpretar um completamente diferente um tipo de alien gena ou vulcano
2540824 o que me lembro que eu era pego constantemente de surpresa com o tema que est vamos lidando eu achava que t nhamos alguns escritores extremamente talentosos e imaginativos que trabalhavam para n s mas nem sempre tivemos bons resultados sou o primeiro a admitir que tivemos in meros fracassos mas considerando o or amento no qual est vamos trabalhando a limita o do tempo e que constantemente est vamos desbravando novas terras em geral os escritores diretores e as pessoas de produ o nos deram um maravilhoso material eu sempre ficava contente de vez em quando eu ficava realmente frustrado e dizia o script de gene roddenberry um problema mas voc apenas supera essas dificuldades e espera que o pr ximo seja melhor e freq entemente era
2540825 eu n o tenho planos para um outra aventura de spock ou livro mas algo poderia me ocorrer ou algu m poderia me apresentar uma id ia ent o novamente nunca diga nunca
2540826 risos isso muito engra ado ele tinha medo de me perguntar eu n o pensei que bill shatner tinha medo de qualquer coisa eu terei uma conversa pessoalmente com ele
2540827 n o mas eu j fiz isso uma vez quando estava trabalhando num filme com yul brenner na espanha
2540828 estou esperando ansiosamente por isto estou muito entusiasmado por este filme e quero ajudar tanto quanto poss vel e espero ansiosamente pelo dia em que eles me chamarem e disserem que precisar o que eu v levar este filme para o p blico
2540829 for inner silence depends on a continual seeking a continual crying in the night a repeated bending over the abyss if we cling to silence we think we have found forever we stop seeking god and the silence goes dead within us
2540830 the document is a challenge to various sharia councils who dont believe in gender equality but the world has changed and islamic law has to be renegotiated
2540831 this document has been carefully researched over a four year period and i feel confident in recommending its findings to women and men of the muslim faith contemplating marriage
2540832 brings muslim marriages in britain into line with positive developments in muslim family law across the muslim world
2540833 a lot of people come to us and the islamic shari ah council for advice and we realised that islamic marriage had lots of problems
2540834 many muslims in this country have a village background with muslims from sylhet in bangladesh or in pakistan where the local imam performs a nikah without proper registration or properly recording that such a ceremony has taken place
2540835 but in britain more marriages are breaking down and young people have said that we need to update things
2540836 in many cases muslim men have put a woman on trial to see if a marriage works out and will not agree to have a civil ceremony
2540837 one woman told me that she came home one day to find the locks had changed and there was a note saying your stuff is at my sisters house
2540838 this contract is revolutionary and will lead the way in addressing problems that exist under sharia law although it is only the tip of the iceberg it is a revolutionary step nothing like this has happened in 100 years the adoption of this model will change everything and force people to talk about the issues

2540845 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili

2540851 ill call it a good start after 10 games not 90 minutes
2540852 we had a lot of possession and were in control but im sure well play better than that and come off defeated
2540853 as a team they doncaster were more comfortable with each other than we were im aware we need to gel pretty quickly we just need one result and we can got on a decent run but talking about it and doing it are two different things
2540854 we were neither a long ball nor a short ball side but a give the ball to the opposition side but theres no point being aesthetic if you dont win
2540855 it was blood and thunder guts and everything and that livened up a dour five minutes
2540856 partnered with the map store to produce these ava maps
2540857 the owb conducted meetings and workshops sent out email and direct mail and worked with regional winery organizations to encourage participation however as you noted some people either didnt hear about the project or decided not to participate
2540858 they were climbing then they fell and were killed it is not clear why they fell
2540859 so the robin and the sparrow sang their chorus oh how sweet dont you know that jesus loves you come and gather at
2540860 the endowments staff pursued a strategy of shielding the fund from market downturns by purchasing credit default swaps that helped protect it from wild market swings harvard also had a larger position than many endowments in plain vanilla treasury debt which outperformed the stock market
2540861 we are what we think all that we are arises with our thought with our thoughts we make our world
2540862 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2540863 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2540864 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked and i guarantee you its going to happen again i promise you
2540865 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2540866 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2540867 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2540868 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2540869 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2540870 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2540871 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2540872 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2540873 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife
2540874 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2540875 the u s set a frenetic pace to open the contest looking much more composed at the outset than in their opening match of the 2008 games against norway the combination of tight organization and quick ball movement kept the japanese under pressure from the opening whistle the u s outshot japan 18 9 on the night while hope solo earned her first olympic clean sheet in her second start
2540876 lloyds goal helped wipe away the bad feeling from the usas first match against norway yes the americans could have scored a few more the usa doubled japans shot total but the japanese were truly one of the best teams the usa has played in a while as far as rhythmical attacking soccer so give tremendous credit to the overall team defense for holding off the nadeshiko
2540877 as long as anyone can remember as long as we have data mortgage rates have been about 1 6 percent above the 10 year treasury rate
2540878 today its more like 2 5 percent above the 10 year treasury thats a gigantic difference literally reducing the amount of house someone could afford by 20 percent
2540879 he passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2540880 cheh so boring nothing to see wan no pictures no nothing whaaaaaat
2540881 cali what is that in your nose did you put something up your nose baby
2540882 want to control which emails you receive from facebook go to
2540883 the two parties announced on march 27 an agreement to collaborate in managing web traffic and to work together to address network management and content distribution
2540884 this matter would have had a better chance on appeal if we had put the horse before the cart and conducted a rulemaking issued rules and then enforced them the majoritys view of its ability to adjudicate this matter solely pursuant to ancillary authority is legally deficient as well under the analysis set forth in the order the commission apparently can do anything so long as it frames its actions in terms of promoting the internet or broadband deployment
2540885 the user clicks on the title of a particular infringing work from fomdbs index a page then appears on the fomdb site in which the work is performed and displayed on an embedded video player

2540887 this sense development arose in the consequence of the wars waged by otto the great and his successors against the slavs a great number of whom they took captive and sold into slavery
2540888 lack self control and steadiness of mind and they are overcome by fickleness foolishness and ignorance such are the blacks who live in the extremity of the land of ethiopia the nubians zanj and the like
2540889 the negro nations are as a rule submissive to slavery because they have attributes that are quite similar to dumb

2540891 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
2540892 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2540893 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2540894 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2540895 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2540896 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2540897 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2540898 this book is for those who are confused by all the stuff you have to know just to take pictures with a digital camera today

2540900 since thefind was launched in november 2006 weve continually improved our ability to help consumers as the leading shopping search engine for lifestyle goods known for our comprehensive search capabilities to find and purchase products in local neighborhoods
2540901 the key design point of our iphone application was to blur the lines between the desktop and the mobile phone creating a rich shopping experience for consumers with comprehensive information available at anytime from any location
2540902 the iphone s location awareness faster downloads lower price and easy access to applications finally create mainstream appeal for mobile local search
2540903 as these new standards permeate the market a consumer use case will quickly grow around finding things to do and buy locally this will be especially resonant in the area of local shopping and finding out exactly what stores have what promotions and what products on the shelf right now
2540904 wifi is becoming more ubiquitous and will continue to become more ubiquitous over the next two years
2540905 when you upgrade from your old iphone to a new 3g version you no longer get any free sms messages
2540906 10 more per month for the new iphones data plan is a rip off
2540907 the easiest thing that apple could have done was simply allow existing iphone users to migrate to the new phone on the same plan rather than requiring them to adopt a new more expensive plan from at amp t t
2540908 poor guys in usa what you really need there is a solid 3 g network it is hard to understand for none usa citizen that a high tech country like usa has still such a poor network so beside the battery point the other 4 points have nothing to do with apple 3g iphone
2540909 the 3g page loading speed is barely noticeable over the old at amp t edge network
2540910 you know subway sandwiches arent as good as quiznos for example this bmt isnt nearly as good as the filet i had at the palm last night
2540911 it sucks when i need to boot up my mac evdo and skype to make a telephone call because my iphone is dead
2540912 10 more per month for the new iphones data plan is a rip off
2540913 but when you do the math over time it will actually cost you much more you are committing between the extra data plan charges and a 5 per month sms charge to pay a minimum of 360 more for your phone service over the next two years

2540915 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off
2540916 at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut it down

2540934 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2540935 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2540936 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2540937 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2540938 the cigarette companies have told us for years that smoking is an individual choice but it is increasingly clear that for some people that isnt really the case
2540939 its a triple whammy this puts the biology genetics behavior and traits of addiction together with one another in the hands of a medical geneticist this could be used to identify families that are at extremely high risk and encourage the younger people to not even experiment
2540940 if humans have naturally occurring differences in the dopamine system in this area of the brain that might be one reason why some people would find their initial exposure to cigarettes rewarding and others would get sick
2540941 i think we have kind of weathered a little bit of a storm
2540942 the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years
2540943 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
2540944 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
2540945 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2540946 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2540947 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2540948 i think most people today know this is just a story
2540949 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2540950 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2540951 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2540952 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2540953 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2540954 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2540955 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2540956 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2540957 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2540958 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2540959 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2540960 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2540961 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2540962 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2540963 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2540964 its not like its going to stop the information from getting out
2540965 sandeep never mentioned about work pressure the option of transfer to some other project available to any executive in the company was open to him
2540966 our work culture which revolves around good work life balance is our unique selling point usp
2540967 this helps the organisation to know about the negative aspects of its working apart from sorting out the aggrieved employees problem
2540968 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2540969 the way i approached the game changed that day i just had one thing in my mind that i have to play for my country and live that dream for my dad
2540970 my first reaction was of absolute joy i could hardly believe it
2540971 a plus point was the chief selector was there i hadnt done as well as id wanted to in the indian premier league so i knew this tournament was an important opportunity it was pressure to have the chairman watching me against tough opposition but once i started doing well i grew more confident about my batting
2540972 dilip sir asked me to keep doing what i do i knew he had been observing me for sometime now and i hope i can live up to his expectations
2540973 he is a very physical type of player he likes to impose himself on the game backs it up with his skill
2540974 i cant be bogged down by a bowler i just like to give it back
2540975 i was asked to open the innings which i dont usually but i remained unbeaten on 120 and helped india win
2540976 he was disappointed that on a couple of occasions he didnt get as many runs as he should have simply because he had wanted to get a reasonable amount of runs a little bit too early therefore we agreed he should be looking to bat into the 40th over
2540977 he just told me to recognise my strong areas during the game and go for the shots i felt confident of and could pull off
2540978 i am naturally confident if i believe in my own ability i dont see anything else in the field i had in mind i had done well in australia and might get a chance soon
2540979 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2540980 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2540981 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2540982 i wanted to keep this mistake i had made two years previously private
2540983 ive never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved
2540984 it has been reported that the number of dead and wounded might unfortunately increase turkey officially conveyed to iraqi authorities that it stands ready to provide any kind of help for the immediate evacuation and treatment of the wounded if need be
2540985 it looked like a normal boil but i couldnt move my arm above my shoulder
2540986 i have signed a decree on a state of war georgia is under a state of total military aggression by the russian navy air force large scale ground operations
2540987 tactical battalions have completely liberated tskhinvali from georgian military forces
2540988 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2540989 it was a little disconcerting to see all the problems with the signatures
2540990 the last couple of days ive been checking the registrations myself on the computer
2540991 i want at least one debate with all four candidates so that nancy pelosi has to answer for her record
2540992 one of the first things we need to do is hire a professional accountant to deal with those reports
2540993 the united states olympic committee is saddened to confirm the death of todd bachman father in law of united states olympic mens indoor volleyball head coach hugh mccutcheon
2540994 mr bachman and his wife barbara were visiting the drum tower in beijing china when they were attacked shortly after noon by an assailant wielding a knife
2540995 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack
2540996 mr bachman died as a result of injuries sustained in the attack mrs bachman suffered serious injuries and was transported to a local hospital for emergency treatment her injuries are serious and life threatening
2540997 the president has been informed and his heart goes out to the families of the victims
2540998 the white house and us embassy have offered whatever assistance the family needs us officials have also been in touch with chinese authorities on the matter
2540999 acting within our peacekeeping mission and in line with the mandate issued by the international community russia is engaged in the task of forcing the georgian side to accept peace while defending the lives and property of its citizens as is required under the constitution and laws of the russian federation and the legal standards of any civilized country
2541000 i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
2541001 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces
2541002 there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime
2541003 we are not fighting peaceful towns and are not conducting military strikes against civilians we are only seeking to ensure peace
2541004 even today i was there in front of the tv with my wife waiting for the team to be announced i was numb when they finished reading the names he said
2541005 crushing blow not to see his name in the list but badri was not ready to miss training but he looked drained out
2541006 for the first time in my life im feeling that im training out of duty
2541007 forget emerging nations trophy i have scored heavily during the a series against australia and south africa earlier and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competitions is gautam gambhir the india a captain pointed out
2541008 when manoj tiwary went to australia i was intrigued still i tried to keep my cool now its virat kohli this is really going nowhere badrinath fumed
2541009 even today i was there in front of the tv with my wife waiting for the team to be announced i was numb when they finished reading the names he said
2541010 i dont know what badrinath has told the media but i cant discuss the outcome of the selection meeting with the press because it is confidential and not for the public
2541011 forget about the performance during the emerging players tournament even before that i scored heavily during india a series against australia and south africa and the only player to have done better than me in domestic competition was gautam gambhir
2541012 it baffled me when manoj tiwary went to australia but still i kept my cool now it is virat kohli this is really going nowhere none of the selectors have told me where i stand they should allow me to fail by picking me in the side if i am unable to prove my worth i will be a fringe player all my life
2541013 essentially this is the illumination of your marketing and life vision in what is ultimately a highly personal and unique way
2541014 he works hard but doesnt want anyone to know it
2541015 i was going to get frank mccourt to donate them
2541016 for my thougths are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways

2541018 the man without the spirit does not accept the things that come from the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually discerned
2541019 for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him
2541020 see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ
2541021 if anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all
2541022 if you love those who love you what credit is that to you even sinners love those who love them and if you do good to those who are good to you what credit is that to you even sinners do that and if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment what credit is that to you even
2541023 in the winter of 1873 many ho chunk people were removed to the nebraska reservation from wisconsin traveling in cattle cars on trains
2541024 this was a horrific experience for the people as many elders women and children suffered and died
2541025 the world just got a little less funny he will be missed dearly
2541026 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2541027 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2541028 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2541029 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2541030 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2541031 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2541032 office business applications are a new breed of application that turn document based processes into real applications
2541033 the circumstances of mannys final hours with the red sox
2541034 i have not received any calls from the commissioners office suggesting that there is an investigation
2541035 i dont know what the commissioners offices viewpoint of this is
2541036 it was a simple transaction we had 10 5 no trade rights the red sox made it clear that they wanted to trade him and we let the red sox know that l a was the place we wanted to go
2541037 you want to have fun sometimes you struggle and sometimes you fight it and you have to decide what your goals and what the team goals are sometimes you have to take a step back
2541038 it never makes it easier you want to play in every game ive been here for three years and ive been through a good season and a bad season like last year its a lot better having a good season than to go through a bad one that makes it easier
2541039 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2541040 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2541041 i know a little bit gymnastics fifty five is crazy crazy im very unhappy with the judging on floor and rings i dont know what happened i dont know what kind of game they play spain judges french judges italy judges they killed us today our score should be much higher
2541042 im so unhappy today because of the serious situation we have because of injuries because of bad judges we expect to be in the top eight its not about injured gymnast brandon oneill even without brandon oneill we can make the team final the judges was ugly ugly
2541043 if kyle makes the final he can win the competition lots of judges from some countries gave him low scores im very unhappy
2541044 i thought our performances were better than the scores we received today
2541045 i felt we were evaluated harshly thats my personal opinion
2541046 its been like this in gymnastics forever and it hasnt changed countries have certain friends and friends help friends i think we were a better team than where we ended up
2541047 to say i was disappointed in the way we ended up would be understatement
2541048 i have been thinking of winning a medal but never thought it would turn out to be the first gold medal for china
2541049 kyles floor should have been a 15 8 at least
2541050 at least and he gets what 15 5 this is crazy it must be some kind of game i am very unhappy
2541051 they were scared of him they knew if he got into the final he could win
2541052 i finished in seventh place and that was my goal to begin with but once youve got that goal its the mountaintop right you always want to get higher especially in that last match
2541053 they didnt give it the point to me because the computer wasnt working even though the judges gave it to me
2541054 so i dont see how that can be and that happened twice
2541055 we dedicate our lives to a sport that really isnt well recognized in canada and thats frustrating but it really separates the half hearted from the people who are really crazy about it like me
2541056 its also nice to come here and be recognized and be respected for what youre really committing your life to
2541057 but it was a data collecting day well analyze what we learned and come back better prepared thats just the process in rowing
2541058 i think it came down to knowing what we can do
2541059 we are very capable of surprising the world here and swimming very fast
2541060 obama is not ushering in an end to black politics only helping to catalyze its evolution
2541061 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2541062 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2541063 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2541064 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2541065 turn up ethical self confoundedly loot the profound sense ethical selfve been cheated
2541066 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2541067 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2541068 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2541069 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself

2541116 yall need to look out for each other out there you need to be peaceful to one another okay this next one is called bullet in your head
2541117 each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering gods grace in its various forms
2541118 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
2541119 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
2541120 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
2541121 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
2541122 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed
2541123 that was funny matt its okay to smile and feel good because i thought it was funny
2541124 even though that wasnt clever at all i still care about your feelings thank you for being here to try and make me smile i love you
2541125 the player in this case will be a free agent in a year from now and he should hear what the gm plans for the team and what were trying to accomplish and how were trying to accomplish it
2541126 i think its probably fairly obvious but i want to talk about it face to face
2541127 thats the intention to try to get everything done before the season
2541128 and again it stars with a conversation between me and him
2541129 la russie est en ce moment une partie au conflit pas un m diateur et cela devra se refl ter lorsque d buteront un cessez le feu et des discussions de paix
2541130 la russie a lanc une invasion militaire de grande ampleur contre la g orgie
2541131 les attaques ont lieu dans des r gions de g orgie loign es de la zone de conflit de loss tie du sud elles marquent une dangereuse escalade dans cette crise
2541132 a soulign que la seule issue la crise tragique provoqu e par les dirigeants g orgiens tait un retrait des forces de tbilissi de la zone de conflit
2541133 il y a de nombreuses victimes de nombreux bless s
2541134 mais je soutiens saakachvili la russie a tort de faire ce quelle fait il faut quelle sarr te
2541135 its only gotta last a year thats what the warranty is
2541136 so yes i do believe there is a difference and i can say it is likely it happened on our watch and we maybe could have prevented it
2541137 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2541138 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2541139 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2541140 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2541141 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2541142 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2541143 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2541144 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2541145 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2541146 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2541147 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2541148 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2541149 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2541150 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2541151 end to the era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism
2541152 bloggers and online commentators have refused to let the story sputter into oblivion
2541153 when the levees broke in new orleans it apparently made him reach for a shot said one insider
2541154 i saw one woman who was grimly whacking away with a cleaver at a pile of squirming gray slime what is that i asked stomach she answered and resumed whacking
2541155 i dont think there is any question that the impeachment process is failing im quite positive he will resign before that
2541156 deter swift boating groups by discouraging contributions to the groups
2541157 create a sense of scandal around donating to these groups
2541158 hey we can host this event and show all of you that we arent such bad guys after all
2541159 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2541160 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2541161 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2541162 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2541163 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2541164 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2541165 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
2541166 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
2541167 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2541168 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2541169 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2541170 i think most people today know this is just a story
2541171 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2541172 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2541173 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2541174 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2541175 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2541176 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2541177 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2541178 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2541179 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest

2541205 for me torres has just got to be about the best striker in the world at the moment
2541206 he will get better this season which is great for liverpool and has got to be a worry for the rest of the division

2541213 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2541214 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes

2541216 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen

2541460 it is great to see that todays teenagers are aware of the costs involved with going to university and are taking steps independently to try and avoid the high levels of debt that are now common amongst graduates
2541461 but the average cost of three years at university now sits at 40 400 a huge amount of money for any teenager to find
2541462 it is becoming increasingly apparent that we need a sea change in the way that many parents and their children fund university
2541463 for those approaching higher education in the next few years the government has a clear student finance package in place but for parents of younger children one way to stave off the financial nightmares of the current university generation could be to start saving now
2541464 a culture of debt is accepted as a normal part of life

2541486 for many years parents have worried about televisions glamorization of destructive sexual behavior this important new report suggests another cause for concern the de glamorization of marriage statistics show that the overwhelming majority of americans feel satisfied and fulfilled by their marriages the notion that sex outside of marriage is inherently more exciting more important more worthy as the subject of story telling is a toxic message for parents and children alike

2541503 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2541504 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth

2541508 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you

2541511 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2541512 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2541513 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2541514 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2541515 things like lighting video equipment can help when theres an open counter type environment like most convenience stores it is tough to prevent from a store owners standpoint

2541519 but there was no hair raising and breast beating cries of genocide and allegations violation of international human rights law there were no expressions of horror when the ltte lined up and shot over 600 policemen who had surrendered to them there was no talk of international humanitarian law then

2541524 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2541525 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2541526 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2541527 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2541528 the lhc is the worlds most powerful particle accelerator producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine and around 30 times more intense when it reaches design performance probably by 2010
2541529 according to the well established properties of gravity described by einsteins relativity it is impossible for microscopic black holes to be produced at the lhc
2541530 although stable microscopic black holes are not expected in theory study of the consequences of their production by cosmic rays shows that they would be harmless

2541916 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2541917 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2541918 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2541919 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2541920 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2541921 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2541922 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2541923 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2541924 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2541925 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2541926 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2541927 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2541928 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2541929 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2541930 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2541931 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2541932 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2541933 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2541934 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2541935 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2541936 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2541937 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2541938 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2541939 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2541940 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2541941 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2541942 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2541943 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2541944 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2541945 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

2541948 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2541949 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2541950 im bertragenden sinne wird die formel auch verwendet f r ein ehrgeiziges projekt dessen ergebnis sich ins gegenteil verkehrt
2541951 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2541952 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2541953 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2541954 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2541955 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2541956 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2541957 pourtant jai essay de limiter les d g ts en renfor ant l quipe
2541958 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2541959 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2541960 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2541961 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2541962 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2541963 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2541964 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2541965 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2541966 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2541967 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2541968 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2541969 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2541970 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

2541972 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2541973 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2541974 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2541975 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2541976 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2541977 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2541978 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2541979 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2541980 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2541981 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2541982 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2541983 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

2542010 voy a refundar el municipio como prestador de servicios y lo voy a lograr jerarquizando y dignificando al empleado municipal
2542011 queremos llevar a todos los barrios de nuestra ciudad una propuesta simple necesaria y honesta no vendemos ciudades de ensue o ni compramos votos con el clientelismo
2542012 cuando un vecino pregunta qu queremos la respuesta es simple
2542013 queremos refundar el municipio devolvi ndole su funci n natural de prestador de servicios indispensables para la vida cotidiana de los ciudadanos
2542014 hay reclamos historicos por el asfaltado en barrios carenciados ellos lo necesitan pero el jefe comunal prefiri ampliar la av san fransisco o crear peatonales ojo no digo que quizas fue bueno hacerlas lo que discuto es la falta de criterio de justicia
2542015 sabemos qu queremos lograr pero m s importante es que ustedes sepan c mo pretendemos lograrlo
2542016 a trav s de la recategorizaci n cada municipal ver una mejora en sus ingresos pero la dignificaci n del hombre no pasa solo por la remuneraci n
2542017 quiero apoyar mi gesti n en el valioso capital humano del municipio existe mucha gente municipal de planta permanente que lleva a os trabajando en alguna rea con una experiencia invalorable la opini n de una persona as es calificada y me animo a decir que superior a la de muchos t cnicos ilustrados
2542018 escuchar a los propios municipales ellos tienen muchas ideas y saben qu necesitan
2542019 por ejemplo d as atr s hablaba con procalas que prestan servicio en la recolecci n de basura estas personas est n velando por la salud de toda nuestra comunidad c mo retribu mos tan preciada tarea con sueldos de 280 pesos no cuentan con elementos indispensables como palas protectores visuales ni siquiera guantes
2542020 los problemas en la recolecci n y el tratamiento de residuos que padecemos los capitalinos tiene un solo responsable quintela como jefe comunal no ha tenido la capacidad de gesti n necesaria ni siquiera para cuidar a su propia gente la experiencia de estos procalas es terrible es como que te manden a la guerra con tan solo dos piedras en las manos
2542021 por eso vuelvo a repetirlo destaca bosetti creo que se puede llevar adelante una tarea municipal acorde a lo que el ciudadano necesita y por sobre todo otorgando un ptimo servicio y podemos lograrlo tan s lo escuchando las necesidades y las propuestas de los empleados municipales los procalas los pasantes y los formadores

2542147 an investigation is being conducted to determine the details surrounding this incident and further information will be made public when it is available
2542148 his best friend describes him as a no nonsense kind of guy who lived like people dreamed he was a fun loving and genuine individual who was totally dedicated to the army and held his section together
2542149 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2542150 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2542151 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2542152 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2542153 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2542154 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2542155 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2542156 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2542157 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2542158 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2542159 two years ago the city council went through an exercise to expand the availability and amount of the senior tax abatement
2542160 we had been hearing from many residents that the burden of large increases in home valuations and as a result tax bills was forcing seniors into a very difficult financial position after two years of the program it is clear we didnt go far enough and i believe the time is right to go to the states maximum allowable benefit
2542161 i want the senior citizens of westfield to know that i have heard what they have been saying
2542162 i promise to be the mayor that will deliver for them a council on aging facility that makes our city the envy of western massachusetts
2542163 this senior center project has been a moving target for the past several years
2542164 the human factor will always be the key to a childs education competent committed and compassionate teachers are the key to student success
2542165 we need to provide westfields teachers with an atmosphere in which they can grow in their profession and provide students with small classrooms and personalized instruction
2542166 technology can no longer be viewed as an enhancement to our classrooms it must be seen as a fundamental component that helps to shape our curriculum
2542167 as former chairman of the councils finance committee i worked closely with the previous administration and our citys technology team to ensure this new tech center would provide us with the bones necessary to serve our schools i t needs for several years to come
2542168 with this system now in place i am committed to providing the front end components required for our teachers to use this resource to the best of their ability
2542169 i think the new superintendent provided a shot in the arm at the right time for our school system
2542170 the past two years have been difficult budget wise on the department but i am optimistic that we have turned the corner and that with increased communication and formation of strong partnerships with local businesses and civic organizations we will be able to better serve our kids

2542181 the first hundred days of my administration will be devoted to setting a sustainable responsible and affordable framework through which the city can address this backlog of projects
2542182 my priorities are repairing our deteriorating roads sidewalks and off line fire hydrants construction of the long promised council on aging facility and planning for the addition and renovation at westfield high school i will work with our partners on the city council to formulate a plan to ensure all of these initiatives can move forward
2542183 in order to make any progress in addressing this critical need we need to increase our city commitment to providing safe roads transportation safety and efficiency affects everyone and the citys development depends on it
2542184 to address this important public safety issue i will work with the department to formalize a protocol for annual testing and replacement of faulty hydrants
2542185 by demanding proper reporting and logging of such duties and providing the resources necessary to address the problem my administration will work to ensure a higher level of accountability
2542186 this senior center project has been a moving target for the past several years
2542187 i will provide the leadership necessary to reach a final determination for the direction of this project and deliver on this promise that has been made to our senior citizens
2542188 as i have listened to many people i have met on the campaign trail this summer a common expectation for city government has been clear
2542189 the citizens of westfield want to be included in the decision making process i think my communication plan will allow for an increased level of engagement between citizens and city hall
2542190 i will begin with teams focused on city finance and budgeting economic development and public works and construction
2542191 as mayor the final decision on what initiatives move forward from my administration will rest with me
2542192 i will rely on feedback i receive from city residents through ward meetings and daily interactions i have with citizens as well as professional advice from these working teams to assess the best direction for our city
2542193 over the past two years our city has made great strides in providing better information through our website particularly as it relates to development projects
2542194 i would work to provide user friendly reports that could show in reasonable detail how the citizens tax dollars are being spent in government

2542232 das problem ist die gr e bildlich gesprochen sieht die austrian airlines nicht einmal den auspuff der lufthansa es gab in der vergangenheit zu viele managementfehler und dann bis vor kurzem daran festzuhalten auch alleine im wettbewerb berleben zu k nnen war fast der sargnagel

2542237 but after seeing the first two heats i kind of wanted to be the top seed going into tomorrow and thats all i went out and did
2542238 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2542239 that was my best morning uhh prelim swim so im happy with it
2542240 but im sure going give him a run for his money
2542241 im going to have a double shot of espresso tomorrow morning
2542242 i think thats the first time hes worn a jammer in two years
2542243 i hope to talk him into something that will cover more of his body
2542244 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2542245 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2542246 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked and i guarantee you its going to happen again i promise you
2542247 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2542248 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2542249 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2542250 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2542251 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2542252 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2542253 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2542254 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2542255 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife
2542256 we build and sell big cars and trucks in the united states because that is what consumers there say they want
2542257 just let someone be are you fucken crazy what if they do something that hurts me what if they start thinking bad things about me what if they stop loving me what if they start doing things that make me stop loving them

2542268 schism is the withdrawal of submission to the supreme pontiff or from communion with the members of the church subject to him

2542298 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make

2542317 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2542318 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2542319 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2542320 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that
2542321 then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2542322 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2542323 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2542324 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2542325 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2542326 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2542327 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2542328 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2542329 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics

2542348 georgien russland und die ganze welt sehen jetzt ganz klar ein dass sich die georgische f hrung mit ihren nato bestrebungen kaum von dem wunsch leiten l sst ein teil der globalen sicherheitssystems zu werden und zum internationalen frieden beizutragen
2542349 ihre nato bestrebungen sind auf etwas anderes zur ckzuf hren und zwar auf den versuch andere l nder und v lker in ihre blutigen unterfangen hineinzuziehen
2542350 gem den geltenden internationalen abkommen darunter aus dem jahr 1999 bernimmt russland friedensmissionen falls eine konfliktpartei gegen die vereinbarung ber den gewaltverzicht verst t ist russland verpflichtet die andere partei in schutz zu nehmen das haben wir in bezug auf s dossetien auch getan

2542356 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2542357 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2542358 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2542359 in our lives there a lot of things we cant control the only thing we can control is ourselves be patient you must be strong

2542364 la india es clave para registrar avances significativos en los objetivos del milenio si la india falla habremos fallado todos
2542365 en la india hay 50 millones de mujeres que sencillamente han desaparecido por efecto de feticidios abortos nadie sabe qu pas con ellas en muchas zonas las madres prestan m s atenci n al hijo var n y le dan ventaja sobre las chicas

2542368 if you let people put tags on you youll never be able to remove them
2542369 is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty
2542370 georgians are by nature extremely patriotic and this event has galvanized them together
2542371 it was as if georgia had won the world cup and was celebrating
2542372 i am obligated to defend the life and honor of russian citizens wherever they may be
2542373 we will not let those responsible for the death of our people go unpunished
2542374 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2542375 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2542376 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2542377 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics
2542378 if the election is close it could come down to small demographic changes in some areas
2542379 we dont know what will happen but were talking about it now it will be the decision of the president of the country mikheil saakashvili
2542380 this deliberate strategy of aggression has grown into a full scale military intervention involving all regions of georgia
2542381 georgia calls upon the international community to make it clear to russia that intrusion into and bombing of the territory of a sovereign state is unacceptable in the 21st century and that such acts cannot and will not be tolerated
2542382 we can only bring the ideal of how sport can bring people together it is a very complex issue and it is not for the ioc to give a perspective on what has been happening
2542383 it is not what the world wants to see it is contrary to what the olympic ideal stands for the sad reality is that there are a number of countries at the olympics that are in conflict
2542384 we weten niet wat er gaat gebeuren maar we praten er momenteel over de beslissing ligt bij president michail saakasjvili
2542385 how can you miss something that hasnt gone away whatsoever

2542394 if there will be a serious decision to end the occupation of iraq those cells will vanish
2542395 there will be no reason to let those cells stay and work
2542396 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to help the iraqi people
2542397 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2542398 lograr la clasificaci n para cuartos y si es como primeros de grupo mejor que como segundos
2542399 clasificarnos segundos tambi n estar a bien porque la prioridad es estar en la siguiente fase pero debemos tratar de hacerlo como primeros de grupo
2542400 en la segunda parte jugaron m s agresivas mientras que en la primera el control fue nuestro
2542401 seguro que no se lo pondr f cil a alemania
2542402 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2542403 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2542404 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2542405 israel backs georgia in caspian oil pipeline battle with russia

2542421 esta ceremonia ha servido para reforzar el nimo de los deportistas peruanos
2542422 cese inmediato de la agresi n contra osetia del sur
2542423 violaciones de los acuerdos anteriores de paz y alto el fuego
2542424 un intento de involucrar a otros pa ses y pueblos en sus sanguinarias aventuras
2542425 creo que esto es ahora obvio tanto en georgia y rusia como en el resto del mundo
2542426 las acciones de las autoridades georgianas en osetia del sur son por supuesto un crimen y ante todo un crimen contra su propio pueblo
2542427 asest un duro golpe a la integridad territorial de georgia
2542428 es dif cil de imaginar c mo despu s de lo ocurrido y de lo que est ocurriendo convencer a osetia del sur de que entre a formar parte del estado georgiano
2542429 la agresi n provoc numerosas v ctimas entre la poblaci n civil lo que desemboc de hecho en una aut ntica cat strofe humana
2542430 laporta me llam mientras estaba en la eurocopa y le expliqu que estaba dispuesto a irme al bar a y que en el club me hab an dicho que 15 millones era una oferta aceptable no obstante antes de jugar contra suecia mi representante me dijo que el club consideraba muy baja esta oferta y el barcelona se fue en busca de alexander hleb
2542431 es parte del gran esfuerzo que se est haciendo con ambos pa ses con los que se formar uno de los grupos empresariales m s grandes de sudam rica
2542432 no vamos a romper relaciones con nadie incluso si algunos pa ses atentan contra la soberan a nacional vamos a tener paciencia
2542433 esperamos poder anunciar lo antes posible esa visita a ir n y estoy seguro de que vamos a firmar muchos acuerdos de inversi n

2542444 me sent a muy ansioso y nervioso por empezar estos juegos despu s de tantos meses entrenando

2542450 i look at the old footage of the coors classic and i just see the foundation of american cycling coming out of that
2542451 the coors classic was the beginning of everything you see today i think as a result of those efforts were still seeing a lot of good things happening in the sport of cycling
2542452 without the coors classic its doubtful american cycling would today boast an expanding slate of stage races nor would there be so many american riders and teams racing in the european peloton
2542453 the coors classic was the springboard for american racing which allowed us to have a living and a lifestyle
2542454 the sheer spectacle of the coors classic has astonished me all over again this video burns bright capturing how this race ignited the sport of cycling in the united states the race was the beginning of great things
2542455 the coors classic was so new and american and dramatic
2542456 the last year of the coors race was the turning point of american bike racing
2542457 a must for any cycling afficionado with a sense of history and a great way to gauge the progress cycling has made over the past 30 years
2542458 porque nadie hizo reservas ni previsiones paraguay puede incendiarse en menos de dos o tres meses
2542459 paraguay depende en un 100 del combustible del exterior y camino a posadas tuve una experiencia al intentar reabastecer mi veh culo en las afueras de asunci n no hab a gasoil
2542460 asumir el 15 de agosto sin medicamentos en los hospitales y sin gasoil es un pa s que se puede incendiar en menos de dos o tres meses hay escasa distribuci n nadie hizo reservas ni se hicieron las licitaciones para la provisi n de insumos de salud
2542461 el presidente electo no recibi toda la informaci n para tener una idea clara de c mo se maneja el tema gasoil
2542462 petropar entrega el combustible a camiones cisternas de empresas propietarias de estaciones de servicio gasolineras y ellas distribuyen a sus bocas de expendio digo enf ticamente que el pa s est abastecido para iniciar su periodo agr cola y transporte de productos agropecuarios
2542463 no es f cil administrar este rubro clave para la econom a y no temo ser investigado posteriormente por mi gesti n aqu no hay ninguna irregularidad las cr ticas tienen tinte pol tico porque la percepci n dice que todos los funcionarios p blicos somos presuntamente bandidos
2542464 el presidente lugo asumir el gobierno con una reserva nuestra de 20 millones de litros y adem s venezuela nos est enviando 70 millones de litros de gasoil a un costo de 70 millones de d lares para que el pa s no sufra inconvenientes
2542465 no queremos que en los pr ximos meses haya disturbios sociales como los hubo recientemente en la argentina planeamos un nuevo impuesto para la producci n de soja pero deseamos un acuerdo con los empresarios agr colas para evitar tumultos o alborotos

2542474 las dictaduras de pa ses como argentina brasil chile y uruguay utilizaron la desaparici n como el arma m s cruel de todas
2542475 desaparecer se volvi un verbo transitivo que describ a a aquellas personas que representaban una amenaza para el estado y por ello eran secuestradas torturadas y ejecutadas por sus propias fuerzas militares

2542484 katrina was a powerful category 3 hurricane when hit the gulf coast the morning of aug 29 2005 broke through levees in new orleans and flooded 80 percent of the city by the time the last of the water dried up weeks later more than 1 600 people across were dead and a shocked nation was looking at miles of wrecked homes mud and debris from the worst natural disaster in its history the anniversary was a reminder of the desperation that filled flooding neighborhoods in the days after katrina hit images of dead bodies people in the flood zones calling from their roofs and waiting days for help and of the thousands of evacuees packed into the grimy and damaged superdome are still fresh in many minds
2542485 just minutes after pleading guilty to felony charges of conspiracy and his involvement in the killing of at least six dogs that had not performed well in testing the falcons star quarterback apologized for his behavior and for initially lying about his involvement expressed regret for being a poor example to young fans and asked for forgiveness

2542490 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2542491 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2542492 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2542493 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2542494 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2542495 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2542496 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2542497 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2542498 when your girlfriend calls for help youve gotta go even if it kills you fight the good fight ill see you when we make up new characters
2542499 im a berserker dwarf im a berserker dwarf ill grind your bones to make my bread
2542500 run you fools run im holding him off to give you time to get out
2542501 stop messing around with this guy weve got to get out of here
2542502 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2542503 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2542504 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2542505 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2542506 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2542507 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2542508 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2542509 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2542510 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2542511 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2542512 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2542513 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2542514 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2542515 complete loose stool water arse gravy of the very worst kind
2542516 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2542517 the first time he kissed her he should have been thinking goodbye to my political career
2542518 feel invulnerable that they feel it has gone on all of the time that im not going to be scrutinized at this level and it will stay private
2542519 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic
2542520 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2542521 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2542522 i dont know what causes one to cross a bright line like this one but its probably going to haunt him for the rest of his life its colossal
2542523 fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2542524 i liked him before but i dont see any integrity
2542525 the image of him and his wife was very important the image of that union
2542526 i have great things to say about john edwards he opened that window up for our rural community
2542527 it gave something to our community and our students and their families
2542528 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
2542529 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
2542530 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
2542531 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
2542532 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
2542533 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2542534 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2542535 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2542536 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2542537 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2542538 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2542539 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2542540 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2542541 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2542542 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2542543 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2542544 but i dont really have a good argument that the government should be the one to prevent abortion because of my religious beliefs
2542545 yes the other issues do matter but as a christian my belief system supports the idea that human life is sacred it doesnt matter if that human life is accidental or the result of rape as tragic as those situations are human life is sacred
2542546 for many democratic activists and operatives the phrase white christian still conjures up images of finger wagging priests and scopes era fundamentalists
2542547 if every american were to pitch in 2 000 we could pay off this years deficit or if we handed over each of us 500 gallons of gasoline or in terms we could all really understand if every american gave up 666 lattes for a year we could pay off this years deficit
2542548 the people who can affect the price of oil would prefer a republican presidential candidate watch the price of oil if it goes down which it may very well it could help john mccain quite a bit
2542549 its not only obamas youth eloquence and energy that have stolen hearts across the atlantic obama has raised expectations of a chance for the nation to redeem itself in the role that europe has loved respected and relied upon
2542550 the 200 000 plus crowd confirmed his rock star status and his more cooperative sounding rhetoric was what the crowd wanted to hear
2542551 mr obamas weeklong tour of war zones and foreign capitals is noteworthy because it is so unusual to see a presidential candidate act so presidential overseas
2542552 sen obama is not just tacking gently toward the center hes lurching right when it suits him hes zigging with the kind of reckless abandon thats guaranteed to cause disillusion if not whiplash
2542553 however you feel about her politics i feel that received some of the most unfair hostile coverage ive ever seen
2542554 if theres anything we need to rescue us from the last eight years its brains good judgment and experience obama has the first two gore has all three
2542555 i have fundamental differences with on the issues and always have i dont have any problem criticizing john mccain
2542556 obama is something special a man who makes difficult tasks look easy who seems to touch millions of diverse people with a message of hope that somehow doesnt sound pollyannaish
2542557 ive been covering presidential campaigns since 1960 i have always said i have never seen the media as much entranced by a candidate than when they were in my very first campaign in 1960 when they were for jfk but im telling you right now the enchantment with obama beats the jfk syndrome
2542558 i knew ronald reagan ronald reagan was a friend of mine barack obama is no ronald reagan
2542559 consequence of economic growth and development untendered by adequate concern and conservation
2542560 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2542561 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2542562 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2542563 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2542564 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2542565 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2542566 real results by the end of my first term in office
2542567 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2542568 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2542569 i will not raise your taxes nor support a tax increase i will not do it
2542570 whoever wins will face a big wake up call as soon as the election is over
2542571 there is no question that the proposals of either candidate would dramatically worsen the fiscal situation
2542572 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2542573 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2542574 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2542575 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2542576 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2542577 just so you all know we did set a record
2542578 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2542579 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2542580 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2542581 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2542582 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2542583 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2542584 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2542585 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2542586 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2542587 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2542588 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2542589 if you are an international organisation dependent on international visitors and guests eliminating your carbon footprint is going to be impossible its about tidying up the edges and not being profligate rather than eliminating it its about doing our best
2542590 the things that will have effect are the price of oil and whether people can come at all
2542591 where a flight is essential people should offset it and be very careful to buy offsets that are genuinely beneficial
2542592 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2542593 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2542594 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2542595 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2542596 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2542597 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2542598 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2542599 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2542600 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2542601 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2542602 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2542603 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2542604 i urge everyone to stop the shooting and stop the bombing and get round a conference table a total ceasefire is the only way to stop the killing
2542605 we need an immediate ceasefire we will call both sides to exercise restraint
2542606 an act of aggression that is incompatible with international law and fundamental principles of security and cooperation in europe
2542607 we have told home minister shivraj patil and other delegation members that our agitation will continue unless the central government comes out with a concrete proposal aimed at restoration of land to the shri amarnath shrine board
2542608 we have heard different viewpoints including those of the sangharsh samiti and those would be discussed at the centre before arriving at a conclusion as to how to resolve the issue
2542609 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2542610 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2542611 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2542612 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2542613 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2542614 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny

2542617 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2542618 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2542619 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2542620 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2542621 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2542622 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2542623 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2542624 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2542625 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2542626 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2542627 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2542628 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2542629 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2542630 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2542631 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2542632 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2542633 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2542634 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2542635 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2542636 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2542637 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
2542638 many of those offshore leases are deepwater potentially lucrative but expensive the shallower the lease the less costly the exploration there is another factor at work as well part of an oil companys worth is the reserves of oil it owns or leases so amassing lots of leases boosts its stock value it is always good to lease more
2542639 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2542640 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2542641 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2542642 mccain told reporters last month that we have untapped oil reserves of at least 21 billion barrels in the united states
2542643 in the eastern gulf of mexico those resources are likely to represent actual oil because the geology is an extension of the western gulf of mexico where oil has been drilled for years there is less certainty about what may lie off the atlantic coast
2542644 if in fact there are 17 8 billion barrels of oil offshore that would equal half the reserves of nigeria or about 60 percent of proven u s reserves it could substantially reduce u s imports for a decade or two or sustain u s production when other fields decline
2542645 remember that natural gas pipeline the oil companies magically never seem to build to the north slope
2542646 and production would not be expected to start before 2017
2542647 saying that production wouldnt begin for 10 years democrats oppose offshore drilling just like they did 10 years ago
2542648 why the democrats cant make the oil companies the bad guys on this issue is beyond me
2542649 its a delicate balance and that balance is being skewed by the 24 7 world of internet and cable news faster faster is the mantra but we need to try our damndest to fact check on demand
2542650 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2542651 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2542652 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2542653 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2542654 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2542655 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2542656 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2542657 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2542658 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2542659 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
2542660 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
2542661 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills

2542666 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2542667 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2542668 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2542671 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2542672 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2542673 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2542674 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2542675 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2542676 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
2542677 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
2542678 it predates me being involved in politics or him being involved in politics im older than him so i serve an older brother role i hope he feels ive been there for him and hes certainly been a very loyal and terrifically helpful colleague
2542679 one of the roles ive always wound up playing is being a translator telling people yes he has a different approach hes serious about change this is what it means and my relationship with him gives credibility to that

2542684 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2542685 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests

2542690 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2542691 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2542692 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2542693 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant

2542695 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2542696 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2542697 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2542698 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2542699 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2542700 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2542701 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2542702 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2542703 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2542704 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2542705 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2542706 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2542707 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2542708 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2542709 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2542710 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people
2542711 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
2542712 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
2542713 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
2542714 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2542715 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2542716 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2542717 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2542718 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2542719 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2542720 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2542721 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2542722 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2542723 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2542724 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2542725 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2542726 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2542727 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2542728 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2542729 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2542730 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2542731 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2542732 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2542733 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2542734 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2542735 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2542736 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2542737 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2542738 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2542739 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2542740 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2542741 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2542742 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2542743 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2542744 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2542745 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2542746 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2542747 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2542748 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2542749 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2542750 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2542751 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2542752 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2542753 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2542754 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
2542755 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
2542756 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2542757 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2542758 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2542759 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2542760 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2542761 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2542762 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2542763 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2542764 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
2542765 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
2542766 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
2542767 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
2542768 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
2542769 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
2542770 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
2542771 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
2542772 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
2542773 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
2542774 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2542775 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2542776 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2542777 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2542778 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2542779 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2542780 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2542781 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
2542782 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
2542783 hi mom this is john doe your son you believe me dont you
2542784 oil generates only 3 percent of our electricity therefore a 100 percent renewable electricity system does little to reduce our oil dependency
2542785 we can not drill our way out of this crisis regarding oil
2542786 americans hate being dependent for our mobility and therefore for our livelihoods on countries often hostile to our way of life
2542787 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2542788 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2542789 dire national security problems inherent in our dependence on imported oil
2542790 this is the reason enron and others were able to manipulate the system in deregulated california 10 years ago a manipulation that led to the near bankruptcy of the state and continues to burden the state budget
2542791 never say you will raise taxes any kind of taxes
2542792 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2542793 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2542794 remembering back to the last time this occurred theres something a little disturbing about 200 000 germans chanting their support for a charismatic leader in the streets of berlin
2542795 what i really meant by saying the surge wouldnt work
2542796 we like mr obama and we hope that he will win the election
2542797 regardless of age or experience some are gifted than others
2542798 btw sen obama has achieved more than you will ever accomplished
2542799 so come november he has nothing to loss except you
2542800 just what kind of a woman do you think i am
2542801 we know what kind of woman you are we are merely haggling about a price
2542802 what is it you are willing to take a stand on what is it you will fight for and what facts can you provide to support the sound bites you babble
2542803 obamessiah is right inflating your tires is a good thing you silly republicans whats your problem people of the world obamessiah was right as usual
2542804 you can fool all the people some of the time amp some of the people all the time amp two outta three aint bad
2542805 in her first week at market speaker of the house nancy pelosi sold just 2 737 copies of her book know your power according to nielsen bookscan since she couldnt get a big fat advance pelosi must have really thought people would want to buy her book chilling thats what enough time in congress does to people
2542806 the weight of obamas problems with mainstream voters was heavier than anticipated
2542807 its clear that the dream of the first black president in history being a muslim born socialist from the pews of rev
2542808 different races may differ in mean iq whites mean 100
2542809 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2542810 we have the courage to correspond with our main allies for what we see as in the interest of kuwait and the region
2542811 it is true that we are allies of america however we are against escalation against iran over its nuclear program
2542812 merely talking about such a closure creates a state of tension and will raise the insurance costs on vessels passing through
2542813 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2542814 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2542815 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2542816 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2542817 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2542818 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2542819 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2542820 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2542821 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2542822 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2542823 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2542824 we are recalling the product from distribution channels until we can determine whether illnesses in virginia are connected to our operations or have some other original source or cause
2542825 kasatochi went from a quiet volcano to an explosive eruption within 24 hours and with very little warning
2542826 we are thankful our colleagues were able to get out before the eruption began they were rescued just in time by a local fishing boat
2542827 fortunately the existing seismic networks on nearby volcanoes picked up the activity at kasatochi volcano
2542828 they were installed with funding from the federal aviation administration to reduce the hazard to aviation from volcanic ash these networks were crucial in recognizing that this volcano had entered the first stage of a major eruption
2542829 our hope is to have monitoring equipment on all volcanoes that pose the greatest threats to public safety
2542830 satellite imagery is useful to see the big picture of what is happening and what is going into the atmosphere but direct instrumentation such as placing seismic monitors around a volcano will help give an early warning and give people more time to plan for hazardous events
2542831 the platforms of the democratic and republican parties can lead to the strengthening of our military and addressing an important civil rights issue this presidential election year provides an opportunity to raise public awareness of the ineffective and unfair dont ask dont tell law
2542832 sldn is grateful for the leadership of congresswoman tammy baldwin chair of the dnc platform drafting committee in working with us her efforts have elevated dont ask dont tell to a more visible position within the democratic party we will seek similar support within the republican party

2542834 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2542835 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly
2542836 weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us
2542837 we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2542838 this ruling gets us one big step closer to the puget sound partnerships goal of recovering puget sound by 2020
2542839 the board concludes that the phase i permit fails to require that the municipalities control stormwater discharges to the maximum extent practicable and does not require application of all known available and reasonable methods to prevent and control pollution because it fails to require more extensive use of low impact development techniques
2542840 the question we asked was do we want salmon swimming through the ballard locks in years to come or not
2542841 to our relief the pollution controls hearing board said yes and here is what we will do
2542842 the court affirmed what the california legislature made clear that global warming must be addressed in land use decisions
2542843 this project would have destroyed vital habitat of some of the most endangered species in the coachella valley
2542844 this ecological and financial disaster should never have been approved
2542845 business as usual sprawl is devastating to our climate and local environment
2542846 building smarter with todays green building technology is a major part of solving the climate crisis
2542847 grant shut up and listen to me will you do that keep your mouth shut you need to come out of the house so other people can go home
2542848 is that right that they cant be in their own house because you are being stubborn and being a coward instead of being enough of a man to come outside answer me answer me grant
2542849 are you going to be a coward and stay in the house or are you going to be a man and come outside and take care of your problems
2542850 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
2542851 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
2542852 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
2542853 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
2542854 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
2542855 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
2542856 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
2542857 sitting under a tree with his friends when a military jeep drove up and the army shot him a live bullet pierced his head the boy died immediately

2542861 those poor people as they continue to get poorer and poorer
2542862 if there is a stronger word than catastrophe i would use that word
2542863 result of gazas dilapidated water and sewage infrastructure undermined by israeli attacks and fuel blockades
2542864 the united states and other donors which have bankrolled president mahmoud abbass palestinian authority and fatah dominated security agencies
2542865 not paying adequate attention to the systematic abuses by those forces
2542866 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
2542867 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
2542868 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
2542869 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
2542870 what you begin to see is a systematic pattern of these species moving northward as we would predict with regional warming
2542871 die dateert nog uit de tijd dat dansen als des duivels werd beschouwd
2542872 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection

2542875 the chinese government is seeking to cover up its ugly occupation of tibet with the bright lights of the olympics
2542876 our action at tiananmen square today highlights the determination of tibetans and people of conscience that no amount of repression from the chinese government will extinguish the desire of tibetans for freedom and to speak out against chinas worsening abuses in tibet
2542877 the world is watching china today as the olympics begin and with this action the voices of the tibetan people will be heard despite the best attempts of the chinese authorities to silence them
2542878 the chinese government will not be allowed to use the olympics to hide the reality of its harsh rule inside tibet
2542879 if we can understand how different sexual systems in plants have evolved we can then begin to understand how sex in general evolves
2542880 humans and other mammals generally have only two sexes males and females
2542881 but other species including plants can evolve bewildering arrays of sexual combinations
2542882 i got interrupted out of a meeting friday and was able to bring matt up to the office and put him in touch with his dad
2542883 we figured you campers must be pretty hardcore if you showed up on bikes
2542884 if youre going to take a week off this is an intelligent time to do it
2542885 if i put in three or four 18 hour 20 hour days in a row im not sharp its just a fact
2542886 it seems to help me to get up a little later in the morning
2542887 we all get caught up in the excitement of it especially us mediocre high school junior varsity athletes
2542888 even the most stirring speeches are easily forgotten when theyre short on content taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall
2542889 in the way of running mates sen obama should consider someone with a knack for brevity and directness to balance the ticket

2542897 there are a certain amount of people who crave the satisfaction which comes from serving another

2542908 ive gotten balanced coverage and broad coverage all we could have asked for heaven sakes we kid about the liberal media but every republican on earth does that
2542909 the liberal media were never that powerful and the whole thing was often used as an excuse by conservatives for conservative failures
2542910 dont believe the right wing ideologues when they tell you the left still controls the media agenda it does not any longer its a fact
2542911 the idea the media now tilt toward liberals is absurd

2542967 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2542968 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2542969 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir

2542977 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2542978 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2543024 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2543025 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2543133 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2543134 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2543135 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2543136 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2543137 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2543138 who are open to doing something on the production side
2543139 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2543140 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2543141 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2543142 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2543143 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2543144 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2543145 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2543146 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2543147 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2543148 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2543149 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2543150 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2543151 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2543152 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2543153 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2543154 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2543155 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2543156 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2543157 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2543158 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2543159 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2543160 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2543161 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2543162 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2543163 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2543164 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2543165 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2543166 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2543167 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2543168 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2543169 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

2543172 i am asthmatic and i used a preparation to treat myself not as a doping agent
2543173 in the 12 years i have been racing i have had an aut for a certain product syndicort my old aut which ran out on 29 may related to that medicine the next one related to another product becotide and that was what led to the positive result
2543174 i dont know if i was negligent or if it was due to the doctor
2543175 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2543176 im going to tune up the equinox and test it out
2543177 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2543178 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2543179 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2543180 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

2543185 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2543186 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2543187 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2543188 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2543189 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2543190 complete line of steinberger including spirit synapse and the revolutionary new zt3 transtrem 3 equipped guitars will soon be available exclusively from
2543191 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2543192 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2543193 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2543194 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2543195 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2543196 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2543197 la nueva constituci n fue hecha por ecuatorianos de forma transparente y sobre todo con infinito amor por esa patria nueva
2543198 pero ahora resulta que son asesores espa oles los que hicieron la constituci n
2543199 se le pagaba 12 000 euros y los pagaba la procuradur a que ha financiado muchas asesor as ese es su deber no solo para la asamblea nacional constituyente sino para muchas otras cosas como contratos petroleros
2543200 los 12 000 euros son por los dos asesores monto en el que se incluye el pago de alojamiento vi ticos pasajes pero ya dicen que son 12 000 euros por cada asesor as se miente en este pa s aqu tenemos las manos limpias no hay nada que ocultar
2543201 no olvidarse de todo lo que sacaron los medios de prensa y los asamble stas de oposici n para ver qui n miente al principio dijeron que eran 80 alza manos porque ya ten amos la constituci n hecha
2543202 despu s que la asamblea era una in til porque se hab a demorado demasiado y que en siete meses solo hab an aprobado 60 art culos con el cambio del presidente de la asamblea dijeron que bamos muy r pido luego que hay cambios en los textos porque hubo una comisi n de redacci n y codificaci n como en todas las asambleas y en los congresos cuyo deber es codificar eliminar los textos que se repiten y ponerlos de acuerdo a la t cnica jur dica y ahora dicen que la constituci n fue hecha por asesores extranjeros
2543203 no hay nada de malo en que haya asesores espa oles
2543204 cuando en la asamblea del 98 y en todas las cosas est bamos repletos de bur cratas del fondo monetario del banco mundial
2543205 ah si aplaud an porque era para implementar el neoliberalismo para defender los privilegios de siempre hoy como queremos cambiar al pa s contratar a dos asesores espa oles es un pecado
2543206 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2543207 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2543208 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2543212 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2543213 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2543214 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2543215 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2543216 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2543217 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2543218 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2543219 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2543220 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2543221 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2543222 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2543223 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

2543228 thats what they are looking for the ultimate confrontation they want a smack
2543229 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2543230 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

2543282 what does this mean in theory more apps and a better shopping experience thats good news for consumers and if it gets more people to buy apps and sign up for mobile internet access plans good news for t mobile too this is a no brainer for smartphones like the sidekick series its forthcoming phone running google android and whatever windows mobile phones the carrier sells

2543301 there is a part of me that unequivocally rejects zach rejects who and what he is as part that turns from him even as i hold him in my arms delighted to feel his breath against my neck to kiss his face
2543302 im not sure anything we ve done for zach has really helped him i know it hasn t in any significant way what has helped me more than anything else has been talking to other women who have handicapped children a cruel common denominator that cuts across the divisions of economics of education of social class

2543313 almost half the hour of talking and nothing came out of it he goes on and on about talent and i didnt learn anything about him he said something about cutting taxes which nobody should care about and stuff but he had no noticeable worthwhile point
2543314 i think george w bush coming to joplin missouri was probably a waste of his time talent is not fair and is always attacking claire mccaskill

2543331 private ownership usually creates wealth but too much ownership has the opposite effect it creates gridlock when too many people own pieces of one thing cooperation breaks down wealth disappears everybody loses gridlock is a free market paradox

2543334 i dont think balance is the right word to describe what my life has felt like over the years chaos is more appropriate i negotiated my tenure track salary on the phone as my daughter clomped around the house in high heels flushing the toilet over and over again but this has taken a toll on me as women we are really programmed to take care of other people but we often forget to really take care of ourselves now i have more realistic goals and boundaries im taking a break from novel writing right now until my oldest graduates from high school

2543338 we have supplied the whole of the south african navy with equipment on board their frigates which has been an honour for us
2543339 no army is able to fight successfully against unconventional or guerrilla warfare but our military is searching for ways to pre empt and detect possible attacks
2543340 the military is obviously one of the few establishments in our country that spends money on research which helps retain the rare talent and skills we complain about brain drain or the flight of specialised skills in the country

2543366 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
2543367 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

2543369 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
2543370 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
2543371 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
2543372 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
2543373 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
2543374 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
2543375 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
2543376 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
2543377 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
2543378 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
2543379 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
2543380 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
2543381 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
2543382 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
2543383 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

2543391 the conference has been a good opportunity to propose different political and financial approaches to the problem of aids but it has lacked concrete action on the issues of exactly what to do and how
2543392 the conference is such a huge event that at times one cant see the complexity the number of relationships that people make and the commitments that are made sometimes we arent able to take in all the information about what is going on
2543393 this historic agreement demonstrates the level of commitment in the region and it is the communitys responsibility to engage in social oversight to ensure that the agreement is fulfilled
2543394 those most at risk including intravenous drug users men who have sex with men and sex workers must participate in public policy making the point is that greater participation of these groups in their own countries should come out of this conference because no one knows more about the problem than they do
2543395 the community of governments international agencies and ngos has been strengthened by the conference we have seen leaders make political commitments
2543396 my assessment of the conference is that it was very positive for mexico and for latin america as a whole in mexico the media coverage was so overwhelming that no campaign that we could launch would have achieved such a level of penetration
2543397 but above and beyond than mexico the situation of latin america was highlighted because the epidemic in our region is normally overlooked and that means the rest of the world does not pay it much attention or give it priority
2543398 we will not let the discussions remain empty words we are committed to following up the points expressed here
2543399 these conferences are not attended by decision makers with the authority to sign official agreements except in this case the regions health and education ministers the rest of the people who participated in this conference come out of a need to learn and share experiences we hope that many of the recommendations made here will be taken up by the countries represented
2543400 the emotion of embarrassment is only felt in the presence of and because of an audience even if that audience is imagined the nature of the audience has only scarcely been investigated so far but it is clearly vital social identity theory holds that when people act as group members their world view changes
2543401 we will investigate what happens when the embarrassed person is not a member of the group particularly if they have a high status
2543402 in this case people might actually show joy at anothers misfortune rather than empathy
2543403 if you trip over in the street you feel very embarrassed of course people in your own group who witness this your friends or those close to you feel empathic embarrassment and try to alleviate the situation and make you feel better

2543409 its the first race and its probably one of the most important ones its about getting it out of your system
2543410 i feel like im pretty satisfied with that time i didnt think id be that fast in the prelims but its going to shape up for a pretty good race tomorrow
2543411 that was something i really wanted to do after watching the first three heats
2543412 i wanted to be in the middle of the pool tomorrow and hopefully that will give me some advantage seeing everybody else
2543413 the first one is always the rough one so im just glad i got it out of the way so i can basically start my racing now its over now and ive got to get ready for tomorrow
2543414 i kind of wanted to go into the final either first or second seed but it was pretty smooth swim for me so ill take it
2543415 tomorrow is really all that matters and i know hes lochte going to be right there

2543423 it has been hard regaining my fitness after the injury but i feel good at the moment and i need to take the next step
2543424 i dont think i am quite there yet and if that means i am not going to be in the first team at burnley then it is good that the manager is prepared to let me get some competitive action elsewhere
2543425 rosenborg play at a good standard and i want to do my best for them but i will not forget that i am a burnley player and i want to come back next year bigger and stronger
2543426 scoring my first goal for the club at accrington in pre season was such a great feeling and it has made me more determined to get back to full fitness and show the fans what i can do
2543427 bes will go on loan to rosenborg until december 31 this will enable him to get match games which are vital for his rehabilitation
2543428 he has been out for a year and is not quite ready to start in our team just now but if he goes there he will hopefully come back on january 1 as a new player and ready to play a part for burnley football club
2543429 bes desperately needs games and this serves a purpose because with all due respect to the reserve league that will not allow him to get back to the level he was at before

2543440 when i first heard about i just thought it was misinformation
2543441 i thought it was just a bad joke its freakish news and its brutal it makes me think twice about going downtown

2543446 they were climbing then they fell and were killed it is not clear why they fell
2543447 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network
2543448 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2543449 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2543450 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2543451 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2543452 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2543453 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2543454 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network
2543455 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us

2543467 what russia has been doing against georgia for the last two days represents an open aggression unprecedented in modern times
2543468 it is a direct challenge for the whole world if russia is not stopped today by the whole world tomorrow russian tanks might reach any european capital i think everyone has understood this by now
2543469 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2543470 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of august 6
2543471 saakashvili has been trying to internationalize the conflicts in georgia since he has come to office
2543472 it has been very much his strategy to make this an international conflict between the traditional west and russia speaking in language of the cold war and saying that this is really the last frontier hes been racking up those kind of expressions in the past few days but this is really nothing new
2543473 why precisely now what made saakashvili decide that this was the right moment politically in my opinion one of the reasons is that mikheil saakashvili believes the current u s administration has certain obligations toward him and the next presidential administration particularly if this is a democratic administration wont feel it has any these obligations and may modify the overall stance on georgia
2543474 i really think he saakashvili has taken it a step too far because if we were really going to push back the russians you would need something like a military intervention and that is not going to happen
2543475 russia has been trying increase its international legitimacy as a defender of international law not only in the caucasus but also weve been seeing this in the balkans as well with the positions russia has been taking on kosovo it is going to be more difficult for them to stand in front of the security council as the big defender of international law while theyre bombing civilian targets and georgian cities
2543476 we are on track and proud of the results we are getting right in line with our expectations we are becoming a reference in the air to air refuelling technology and systems with the markets acknowledgement
2543477 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2543478 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2543479 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2543480 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different that any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2543481 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
2543482 when i can become the chief minister of the most populous state four times why can i not not become the prime minister of the country even if i am born in a dalit family

2543487 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2543488 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2543489 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2543490 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2543491 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2543492 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2543493 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2543494 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2543495 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move

2543504 if you were say investing in a mutual fund or something like a bank stock and you knew what you were buying youd know the possibility that it was going to lose money but in this case we werent informed
2543505 we just have to get better were doing some good things but the consistency isnt there on either side of the ball
2543506 weve got a lot accomplished we got to see a lot of guys it was a good week they are learning a lot they are progressing they are making mistakes and they are learning from their mistakes

2543512 the lord did not set his love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any of the peoples for you were the fewest of all peoples but because the lord loved you and kept the oath which he swore to your forefathers the lord brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery from the hand of pharoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord your god he is god the faithful god who keeps his covenant and his lovingkindess to a thousandth generation with those who love him and keep his commandments
2543513 we in america have attempted to make god in our image we like a god who is just holy enough to be cool but not too holy to be scary we like a god who is willing to fudge and cut corners because we like to do that the bible presents a different god altogether we want a god who is tolerant of sin we want a god who is like a grandpa who will blink his eye and sort a wink at it and turn his head and bury it under a rug that is not the god of the bible we have presented in the bible god who is all together holy who is absolutely righteous and who has no proclivity in himself to tolerate sin and is under no obligation to tolerate sin in any way shape or manner
2543514 in the first year of his reign i daniel observed in the books the number of the years which was revealed as the word of the lord to jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of jerusalem namely seventy years so i gave my attention to the lord god to seek him by prayer and supplications with fasting sackcloth and ashes
2543515 for the word of god is living and active and sharper than any two edged sword and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart
2543516 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power

2543534 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2543535 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2543536 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2543537 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2543538 who is this caroline person who has written that comment
2543539 it was a very interesting post filled up with the answers of the people to the questions asked in twitter
2543540 and despite a few mistarts and off notes it was four star fun
2543541 if classical presenters gave us much more contemporary music and contemporary classical music was fruitfully engaged with the world classical music would have more cultural currency and immediacy thus leading to fewer existential questions regarding the genre

2543543 oh thats ok the light is yellow that means yield ill just wait for the next arrow
2543544 hey come hear a lecture on ancient chinese agriculture the lecturer is really brilliant
2543545 im sure shes terrific but the subject just doesnt interest me
2543546 shes such a great mind that youll learn something that enriches your life
2543547 maybe but there are lots of things that enrich my life so i think ill just skip this one
2543548 oh but this minister s so profound that youll get something from her even if your own faith is very different
2543549 i can get something just as deep from things that arent so alien to me
2543550 that can bring in new audiences by saying theyre not any better than what people already like
2543551 that can bring in new audiences by saying theyre not any better than what people already like
2543552 stop watching the mets on tv turn off project runway throw out that feist cd you just bought listen to beethoven instead
2543553 all the pros give one of the boys a cross platform appeal but theres little question that its revolting personality is all down to katy perry who distills every reprehensible thing about the age of the hills into one pop album
2543554 i t can readily be seen that a work or its performance is only ever translated into the poorest of linguistic categories the adjective this music is this this execution is that
2543555 but if your job as it is in pop is to create an event then anything goes
2543556 theres a problem with the way the classical music world talks about itself
2543557 when you start programming music thats something other than the same old warhorses ill give money and buy tickets but im not going to waste my time and money on yet another performance of beethovens fifth ever
2543558 please dont interrupt while i am speaking as we are from this point onward peers in the family of nations i hope you have reviewed the diplomatic instruments we sent by courier last night to department of state which delineates the terms of our divorce
2543559 i did receive those and you have no earthly idea the can of whoop
2543560 please sir maintain the decorum of these proceedings so we can move forward to an amicable separation i give you my personal assurance on the safety and well being of all federal personnel we have detained for immediate repatriation to the remainder of these united states any non law enforcement federal personnel who wish to remain behind will be permitted to do so
2543561 i hope you have thought through the consequences of what you are embarking on
2543562 mr president we have had over two hundred years to give the rulers on the potomac a chance but that time has expired effective immediately all so called federal lands now belong to the nation of idaho and we will dispose of these lands at our leisure in the interest of burying the hatchet we will not seek compensation for the seizure abuse and tenure of federal practices on the aforementioned land and call the balance even
2543563 in actuality they belong to neither of us sir on to other business i have alerted my national guard forces to establish checkpoints at all the main arterials in and out of idaho all national guard forces deployed overseas will return home in the next 48 hours i would also caution you on the use of military force to convince idaho and its citizens to forcibly return to the yoke of the union idaho has a well deserved reputation as a rather well equipped state in firearms possession and use as yamamoto said you may find a rifle behind every blade of grass
2543564 no sir i am simply making an observation about the hazards of one country invading another
2543565 you are land locked governor and wholly dependent on federal subsidy for a great deal of employment and infrastructure in idaho
2543566 no longer the tremendous tax burden across the spectrum formally imposed in our nation as a subject state in your country is now effectively terminated and we are going to unleash the free market to address all of our former shortcomings as a result of the overarching government supremacism practiced here before in telephone conversations with my neighboring governors we are on the verge of confederation negotiations that will pave the way for idaho embassies in british columbia montana utah and wyoming we do intend on opening a consular office in dc as soon as we can ensure the diplomatic baggage containing sufficient weapons assures our safety in the greater dc metropolitan area for our diplomatic personnel
2543567 governor what constitutional right do you have to secede from the us
2543568 mr president the behavior you have exhibited toward the constitution has been at best characterized by active neglect and abhorrence for the restraint on governance in the bill of rights i am rather surprised you would resort to assuming the document in any way has weight in washington dc i would suggest my rights extend as far as our ability to throw off what has become a government of occupation instead of cooperation we resign sir and wish to go in peace
2543569 i will use every measure in my arsenal to force you back into the fold
2543570 mr president thank you for the heads up but we have taken certain precautions to ensure that any rash measures on your part have a disproportionate impact in the dc virginia corridor please dont press us on the issue i would like to offer one more rather moderate important proposal to our future business these united states as administered by dc are now essentially bankrupt war on the world out of control spending and borrowing debt and deficit non funded future liabilities in the tens of trillions and a banking infrastructure rotten at every level has pushed the us to an economic abyss from which it cannot shrink we will provide you a demonstration project of tiny government free banking and a formerly enslaved citizenry unleashed to realize their potential with no government interference we simply wish to go our own way untethered from the remora nation dc came to symbolize
2543571 this is my first title and i hope its the first of many
2543572 for me torres has just got to be about the best striker in the world at the moment
2543573 he will get better this season which is great for liverpool and has got to be a worry for the rest of the division
2543574 you saw how good he was at the european championships and i am sure scoring the winning goal in the final will have done his confidence the world of good
2543575 i am looking forward to playing alongside him of course i am
2543576 the schubert sonata in d opus 53 a far wider and more personally conceived structure than that of a mozart sonata thomson had just been talking about curzon walked around in
2543577 he did not get lost in it or allow us to forget its plan but he did take us with him to the windows and show us all its sweet and dreaming views of the austrian countryside some of them filled with dancing folk
2543578 the terraced dynamics and the abstention from downbeat pulsations just as in the mozart piece kept the rendering impersonal at no loss to expressivity on the contrary indeed the dramatization of it as a form the scaling of its musical elements gave it evocative power as well as grandeur of proportion
2543579 and its enormous variety in the kinds of sound employed its solid basses and a dry clarity in the materials of its structural filling prevented monotony from becoming a concomitant of its vastness
2543580 the piece was long but it had enough different stuff going on that it didnt get boring
2543581 does this mean anything more than he played it well
2543582 he did not get lost in it or allow us to forget its plan but he did take us with him to the windows and show us all its sweet and dreaming views of the austrian countryside some of them filled with dancing folk
2543583 i think wed say that the rewards we get from classical music go pretty deep
2543584 schubert was only 15 when he wrote this quartet and composed the entire third movement while sleeping
2543585 pop reviews pretty accurately convey what we get from pop
2543586 everything was in sync and the whole house moved to it
2543587 im not repeat not saying social context is the most important value
2543588 well the performance was great but i just dont like how that piece restates the main theme so much
2543589 the evils of penguin suits and hushed uncomfortable concert halls
2543590 that pop music gives ben more ideas more substance to work with
2543591 im saying that pop music gives ben more ideas more substance to work with
2543592 id read all this and decide that pop music is serious and classical music is light entertainment
2543593 but have you read any good rock criticism id recommend the rolling stone illustrated history of rock amp roll the pop critics in the new york times stranded
2543594 pop music gives ben more ideas more substance to work with
2543595 classical music here seems like a technical exercise the pieces are known so how were they played badly or well
2543596 the role robert woods bliss played in stravinskys life and era or why beethovens fourth is arguably grossly underrated among the works of his overall oeuvre
2543597 the orchestra played without much precision at times obscuring crucial details
2543598 i could barely believe my ears the first long chord of the orchestral introduction was played very carelessly so carelessly in fact that at first i couldnt tell if it was a major or a minor chord at first this annoyed me but then i just about began to laugh i hadnt heard anything that sloppy from a major orchestra in years
2543599 pop music gives ben more ideas more substance to work with

2543602 ms du bois commented from the stage that the storm her sonata for cello and piano originally for violin and piano recast the turbulent emotions she felt at 18 as a roiling tempest romantics might have deemed this sturm und drang nowadays to borrow a term from rock it was pure emo
2543603 theres no better way to understand why classical music doesnt speak to many people these days
2543604 through much of the set the curiosity and generosity in mr gil s words and ideas didn t get into the music the band was doing a brazilian version of foursquare rhythmic professionalism the show included uninspired reggae versions of the bossa nova standard garota de ipanema the girl from ipanema and george harrison s something as well as pickings from mr gil s own work since the late 70s mostly not his best so much of the show seemed to separate theory from practice
2543605 hey thats interesting whats she going to do with it
2543606 most classical music reflects at best a world which has vanished
2543607 the classical music business as we know it today is among much else a glorious basking pool we can love that if we want but we shouldnt confuse this with art
2543608 hey youve got something there if youre a martian youre a martian and i cant command you or any other martian to have the martian reactions i expect

2543612 its another balmy weekend on the beach in naples by the rocks a couple soak up the southern italian sun a few metres away their feet poking from under beach towels that cover their faces and bodies lie two drowned roma children the girls cristina aged 16 and violetta 14 were buried last night as the fallout from the circumstances of their death reverberated throughout italy it is an image that has crystallised the mounting disquiet in the country over the treatment of roma coming after camps have been burnt and the government has embarked on a bid to fingerprint every member of the minority two young roma sisters had drowned at torregaveta beach after taking a dip in treacherous waters their corpses were recovered from the sea then left on the beach for hours while holidaymakers continued to sunbathe and picnic around them

2543615 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2543616 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2543617 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2543618 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2543619 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you

2543637 to the paltry handful of meddling congress members and the gang at cspi wed like to inform you that not only are we keeping beer advertising but were increasing our beer advertising on top of that were now taking ads for hard liquor and fast women any coaches and athletic directors worried about the purity of the game will be required to turn over every single dime of sponsorship money from nike and gatorade this afternoon and to all those division i schools and coaches who whined about this youre all bumped down to division iii and the only sports youll be allowed are crew and womens field hockey have fun further i say if youre going to try to legislate advertising in ncaa ads you pass a law forbidding chevrolet from running the same commercial with the same song 8 000 times per game thats something fans both young and old might appreciate

2543719 the contingencies fund continued to be abused with amounts drawn from the fund being utilised to meet expenditure which did not meet the eligibility criteria as defined in the act according to the statement amounts totalling 3 945 billion were drawn from the fund by way of 138 advances as at 31 december 2006 forty nine of these advances totalling 1 721 billion remained outstanding
2543720 in fact there is absolutely nothing irregular about contingency fund advances that remain outstanding at the end of the year
2543721 this indeed was the case with the advances outstanding at the end of 2006 which were cleared by a supplementary appropriation act approved shortly thereafter the auditor generals statement on the amounts outstanding at the end of the year can by no stretch of the imagination be extended to be interpreted as an irregularity in relation to these amounts

2543760 no artists are part of a movement unless they are followers and then they are unnecessary and doing unnecessary art if they are exploring in an individual way with different ideas the idea of another individual they are making a worthy contribution but as soon as they call themselves followers or accept the truths they have not explored as truths they are defeating the purpose of or any style of art as an individual expression art as art
2543761 the man who has honesty integrity the love of inquiry the desire to see beyond is ready to appreciate good art he needs no one to give him an art education he is already qualified he needs but to see pictures with his active mind look into them for the things that belong to him and he will find soon enough in himself an art connoisseur and an art lover of the first order

2543877 isnt it as easy as just buying used books and avoiding new books
2543878 washington state lawmakers are facing a collegiate conundrum how to reign in professors and publishers who keep ordering and churning out expensive new textbooks which often are not very new without hurting the students they were trying to protect correspondent dan springer reports on what they did and how well its going
2543879 as the cost of college tuition soars so too does the price of textbooks campus bookstores shelves are lined with required reading that runs well over 100 per title ralph naders public interest research group or pirg which has chapters at many schools is leading the charge against publishers it claims inflate prices squash the used book market and profit on the backs of cash strapped kids
2543880 the publishing industry can make money along the way and be a part of the solution but the problem is that they are completely unregulated and students bear the cost
2543881 the washington state legislature doing what it can to bring prices down passed a law that requires publishers to tell professors the retail prices of books they are selling and if there is a new edition reveal exactly what material has been updated or changed
2543882 in many cases we have seen new editions where only a couple pages have been changed maybe they update dates on illustrations they add some color and that really doesnt change the substance of the course material
2543883 one professor whose principles of microeconomics book is now in its fifth edition thinks the regulations will hurt students in the long run i think it would be the same effect if you told microsoft they couldnt put out new versions of their software would the old software work sure but in fact you have to give people the incentive to innovate publishers contend they are keeping a lid on prices by offering e books and partial versions on line which only cost a fraction of the bound editions they also say naders claims are propaganda aimed at recruiting new members
2543884 well a lot of pirgs existence is just to get publicity and umm heck textbooks have been a subject of hot debate since i was in school he looks to be in his mid to late 50s students spend between 700 and 900 a year on textbooks or roughly 5 of the total cost of their education still those same students are able to find money for other college activities research shows the average college student spends at least 900 a year on alcohol

2543937 shell say but i just slept with you sure but cooking is personal you have to hold something back
2543938 all methods of preventing pregnancy and i mean all even tubal ligation and vasectomy have a failure rate this happens because this is the reproductive system so the organs want to get the girl pregnant as soon as possible so keep in mind that barred absence of the essential organs in each and every sex act pregnancy is possible and should be faced as a clear possibility
2543939 attaching that motivation to catholics is done by confused people but its not a made up reason for why some christians eschew birth control
2543940 even if no breakage or slippage is observed 1 2 of women will test positive for semen residue after intercourse with a condom
2543941 hopefully having that in a widely read article is a small step in combating that kind of
2543942 theyre supposed to survive the nuclear holocaust and they need to get out of the heat
2543943 objectively keeping an orderly house should be a high priority
2543944 objectively keeping an orderly house should be a medium to low priority
2543945 would i turn this into a rule that every child should be taught
2543946 if you bring something into your living space you bring with it a responsibility to keep it reasonably clean in good repair and out of the way of your and other peoples day to day life when you are not using it if you cant take care of the thing in this way then you need to release it back into the wild regardless of the sentimental attachment you have for it b c obviously if you cared that much about it you would keep it clean
2543947 i notice that there are no convents or monasteries where its acceptable for the place to be a wreck
2543948 eh ill be giving her a bath in an hour anyway
2543949 the joys i imagined id do as a mother when i was pregnant with my first born
2543950 look this is very simple dont put the cups in that way if you do theyll flip over during the wash dont do it
2543951 if you dont like how i do things feel free to do it yourself otherwise shut up
2543952 why do catholics think they need to offer up their sacrifices and sufferings to jesus on the cross when the bible clearly stated that jesus sacrifice was sufficient for our salvation
2543953 i did the work and yet there remains more work for me which somebody else imposed on me because she loaded the washer wrong i hate this
2543954 im going to do something evil today and im ok with that
2543955 its ok just do it theres nothing wrong with that
2543956 but rescuers did differ from others in their interpretation of religious teaching and religious commitment which emphasized the common humanity of all people and therefore supported efforts to help jews
2543957 in recalling the values they learned from their parents rescuers emphasized values relating to self significantly less frequently than non rescuers
2543958 the parents of rescuers were significantly less likely to emphasize obedience obedience is the hallmark of non equals obedience as an end unto itself facilitates adaptation to any type of authority whether merited or demanded
2543959 without god or to phrase it another way without objective truth we are sailors without a compass trying to rely on gut instinct to navigate troubled waters
2543960 without god or to phrase it another way without objective truth we are sailors without a compass trying to rely on gut instinct to navigate troubled waters
2543961 around this time someone told me that one of the christian denominations claimed that god did leave us this
2543962 without god or to phrase it another way without objective truth we are sailors without a compass trying to rely on gut instinct to navigate troubled waters
2543963 your desire for real freedom sounds like it is as powerful as invite you to take a closer look at what it is exactly that she found
2543964 to think only your belief in god is what keeps you from being a bad person you have no human decency you have no compassion you only have your belief in a man in the sky to keep you from doing wrong
2543965 secular humanism and empathy are based in something much stronger and much more sound
2543966 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network
2543967 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2543968 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2543969 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2543970 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2543971 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2543972 we do the right thing because god tells us to
2543973 if you had to choose between god and the truth which one would you choose
2543974 valuing other peoples lives showing kindness and empathy to others putting other people before yourself seeking happiness these things all sounded right but i saw no evidence from looking at the evolution of our species or the way the chemistry of our brains worked that would clearly indicate that any of these things were objectively good it started to seem to me that there was no such thing as an objectively true moral code that rights and wrongs were all just a matter of opinion
2543975 plato showed long ago in his dialogue euthyphro that we cannot depend upon the moral fiats of a deity
2543976 a common secular ethical principle is to consider which out of a set of potential actions would do the greatest good for the greatest number and that is the
2543977 and what is a relativist someone who doesnt follow what a church says god thinks is right
2543978 someone who doesnt believe in and therefore doesnt follow what a church says god thinks is right
2543979 your morality seems to be based on what you like find appealing etc
2543980 and the one big concept which i got out of its pages was something that was to revolutionize my whole life
2543981 as to morality it is derived from empathy i am no greater than any other person nor is my experience unique i have certain needs and desires i want to live eat be healthy be left to live my life peacefully therefore other humans have these desires as well because a properly functioning human brain has an inherent sense of empathy which is a biological phenomenon i realize that i dont have the right to violate or limit anyone elses needs or desires
2543982 but because i believe in the dignity of the human person
2543983 the needs of the many outweigh those of the few
2543984 sandy communists are crackpots if you can be convinced by commie logic well believing that something can exist because you have defined that it does is just silly
2543985 the needs of the many outweigh those of the few
2543986 im ready when shall we begin your instruction to ready me for baptism and reception into the faith
2543987 all my life ive tried to be a good example but after seeing the corruption in rome youre ready to convert
2543988 im a business man no purely human effort would have existed 14 weeks let alone 14 century run by such corrupt men it must be protected by god
2543989 your view makes sense if you assume x my view makes sense if i assume y
2543990 oh i hadnt thought of it that way i didnt know that
2543991 why jefferson an atheist should object to one set of meaningless atomic arrangements being randomly sorted into different arrangements a reason that is besides the one that he has previously provided which is that he would not like it
2543992 if you are going to debate the legitimacy of a belief system based on the potential danger it presents secular scientists are vastly more vulnerable than christians
2543993 uh jennifer it is widely accepted that not all human life is equally valuable
2543994 god has to hide his work because if he didnt
2543995 hey i know whats going to happen next the circles going to get bigger smaller
2543996 god made that car stop at just the right moment
2543997 you just said god makes sure our prayers are answered
2543998 i ask for something and god gives it to me but if i didnt pray i wouldnt have got it
2543999 i have no idea i cant say for sure im not god
2544000 but look at this amazing coincidence it cant really be coincidence this proves god exists
2544001 why does god let people suffer so in that case
2544002 well if you think it involves everyone getting into heaven unless we use our free will to deviate from the plan because the devil convinced us of an evil lie id have to say that doesnt make a lot of sense to me
2544003 youre an idiot the universe is f 4 ed up
2544004 i cant say theyre true for sure they might not be but they fit what ive seen of the world better than any other story ive heard particularly a biblical one
2544005 1 your morality seems to be based on what you like find appealing etc so if someone finds something you consider immoral appealing say for instance killing baby seals how do you tell them theyre wrong
2544006 a moral judgment is true if it is backed up by better reasons than the alternatives
2544007 2 id like you to do what the writer walker percy called a thought experiment imagine you are a woman perhaps you are in which case this will be easy to imagine you and one other passenger a male whom you find physically and intellectually repulsive survive a plane crash on an island in the pacific the island is rather large and has sufficient food water etc so that you are phsically well off you hear on shortwave radio right after the crash that a nuclear war has broken out you a climatologist figure from prevailing wind patterns that fallout will not effect where you are so you and the repulsive male are like adam and eve only you find adam repulsive but adam wants to mate with you he makes his clumsy appeals but it only repulses you more he says he will rape you so that the human race survives would that be moral
2544008 i guess the question i have for our atheist friends is this is there anything greater than you is your source of morality something that is above and beyond you whether that is some transcendent value or merely an implicit social agreement or are you makers of your own morality is something right and good because it is inherently so or because you say so
2544009 if it is the latter if we are each makers of our own morality if i have my
2544010 if one actually reads serious moral theology the situation is much the same
2544011 my pastor priest other religious authority told me so and s he cant be wrong
2544012 this is incidentally one of the primary claims that sets catholicism apart from the other christian traditions catholics believe that christ promised that the holy spirit would guard over the teaching authority of the church and prevent its leaders from teaching error most of us see this unchangeability as a feature but there are those primarily those who want a change in morals on some particular activity who consider it a bug
2544013 god is protecting us from teaching incorrectly thus we jackied said
2544014 this will explain to everyone in every time and place exactly and without question what god meant
2544015 my pastor priest other religious authority told me so and s he cant be wrong
2544016 god is protecting us from teaching incorrectly thus we cant be teaching incorrectly because god is protecting us from teaching incorrectly
2544017 god gave us the bible and thats how we know what god wants us to believe
2544018 god gave us the church and before that gave us israel and the church both preserves the scriptures and the teachings of christ that are contained in them
2544019 we cant change the past we cant change the present so
2544020 what principle guides your life what gives your life meaning
2544021 because all answers deceive if ye put the question from within time and are asking about possibilities the answer is certain the choice of ways is before you neither is closed any man may choose eternal death those who choose it will have it but if ye are trying to leap on into eternity if ye are trying to see the final state of all things as it will be for so ye must speak when there are no more possibilities left but only the real then ye ask what cannot be answered to mortal ears time is the very lens through which ye see small and clear as men see through the wrong end of a telescope something that would otherwise be too big for ye to see at all that thing is freedom the gift whereby ye most resemble your maker and are yourselves parts of eternal reality but ye can see it only through the lens of time in a little clear picture through the inverted telescope it is a picture of moments following one another and yourself in each moment making some choice that might have been otherwise neither the temporal succession nor the phantom of what ye might have chosen and didnt is itself freedom they are a lens the picture is a symbol but its truer than any philosophical theorem or perhaps than any mystics vision that claims to go behind it for every attempt to see the shape of eternity except through the lens of time destroys your knowledge of freedom witness the doctrine of predestination which shows truly enough that eternal reality is not waiting for a future in which to be real but at the price of removing freedom which is the deeper truth of the two
2544022 because he wanted to create a baby not a painting
2544023 hey we all agree cancer and or poverty is bad
2544024 ive made enough decisions today the rest wont be very reliable
2544025 the theory that the meaning of life is to know and love and serve the one who created us and that we will always be restless we will never find true harmony in our lives until we understand this might have lingered somewhere in my subconscious its such a clear testable statement it just begs to be tried
2544026 i wouldnt have found this at all compelling at the time since in my mind belief in god was like belief in santa claus
2544027 the meaning of life is to know love and serve god
2544028 you shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and thy mind and all thy soul and you shall love your neighbor as yourself
2544029 the meaning of life is to live in truth and love and be loved we exist to love and to be loved in truth
2544030 when we love we are fulfilling our deepest need and becoming most fully ourselves most fully human
2544031 you must love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind and with all your strength
2544032 to satiate the thirst of jesus on the cross for the love of souls
2544033 service to others is a drink offered to him in offering that drink our thirst is quenched i thirst i quench
2544034 different from me im good so i just couldnt understand evil
2544035 to do whatever i can to see that the place i leave behind when i die is better than it would have been if i had not lived
2544036 now if only id read that article back then id have made a better decision
2544037 the number of bidders would shoot up for the state that has adopted this system as a result the state can save a substantial amount ranging between 10 per cent and 15 per cent
2544038 bidders can also opt for e payment system but government has to ink an mou with the selected bank before the system is operated through the latter
2544039 when everything is set the government will present a demonstration before a panel of experts invited from the states that have adopted this system
2544040 it would definitely benefit both government and contractors of national and international stature if tender notices are floated through internet to seek expression of interest

2544086 yeah i went all the way to bulgaria and rented the first two because i figured i should know what happened i put them into the vcr and couldnt watch i had an idea of what the villain was like with the funky walk and all i needed was to see it once and the next time im alone in bed i wont be able to sleep and i figured i didnt need to see the others in order to play the character
2544087 i figured theyd cgi her in i didnt know they were going to paint her up and have her chase me around a hospital for hours it was not cool meanwhile the girl who plays kayako is an absolute doll and i ended up becoming good friends with her i wasnt expecting that

2544092 eu diria que hoje sim est o liderando uma cruzada contra evo morales
2544093 se chegarem ao extremo os lideres regionais deixar o de enviar recursos para o governo central o que seria bastante grave

2544099 a few hours ago i as a supreme commander gave an order a very painful order that none of georgias military units open fire in response to the intense bombing
2544100 the snipers war is continuing against the residents of the villages and at this moment while i am talking the intense fire is now ongoing
2544101 we have been in constant contact with the commander of the local russian peacekeepers they claimed that they totally lost control over separatists
2544102 i offer the hand of friendship and partnership to all of you despite the acts that have been committed by you
2544103 georgians are by nature extremely patriotic and this event has galvanized them together
2544104 it was as if georgia had won the world cup and was celebrating
2544105 i am obligated to defend the life and honor of russian citizens wherever they may be
2544106 we will not let those responsible for the death of our people go unpunished
2544107 this law provides the framework to ensure our people and physicians are protected as we take advantage of the life saving technologies in the medical field that will greatly enhance cost savings for guams families
2544108 there would have been a serious health risk it was the hardest decision i ever had to make in boxing
2544109 but we dont want to see a manny pacquiao who has already been destroyed
2544110 we want to watch manny pacquiaos fight here in vancouver but we would prefer that he is still unmarked and intact and was not destroyed by de la hoya
2544111 if he wins either against soto or valero the filipino community in vancouver will definitely rejoice even more and go all out to support his next fight here next year
2544112 a mother knows what is best for his son they should obey her
2544113 but he should come here with his name intact so that we will be even more proude to invite our friends to watch his fight
2544114 masyadong malaki na si de la hoya why are they allowing this fight to happen
2544115 but as a filipino i will still root for manny pacquiao as we all idolize him here
2544116 ha totoo ba talaga yun is it really for real
2544117 while mannys not a participant in the olympics he epitomizes the ultimate pinoy athlete having gained unprecedented records and success as a world champion
2544118 the flag bearer represents the best of any country plus the fact that any juan de la cruz identifies sports today with manny there is no greater once in a lifetime honor our country can give than to make manny walk beside federer nadal kobe lebron and the others in the same arena manny deserves it
2544119 i imagine that as our filipino athletes march on that grand opening olympic parade they will have a glimpse of manny from time to time
2544120 this should make them aware of the presence and support of the most prestigious athlete in our land today even for a few moments this should make them aware of his triumphs and achievements through hard work dedication and faith in god while making them feel proud that he is at the frontline of the delegation and holds our national flag eventually this will inspire them more as the competition starts may we have a medal
2544121 this should make manny realize more the meaning and impact of a manny pacquiao to the filipino athlete and to the filipino people
2544122 as the saying goes with great power comes great responsibility
2544123 manny was so calm as we played chess while i was getting tense surely not from playing chess
2544124 i was thinking in a few moments he will be fighting as a lightweight for the first time
2544125 may probably have to sit till december because i dont know whether i can put another fight together for him
2544126 na bo bother talaga ako sa mga nangyayari sa bayan namin ngayon kasi may threat na lusubin ng milf
2544127 naiwan duon sa midsayap ang mga magulang ko at kapatid at di ko alam kung safe sila duon
2544128 i want to join the cvo in fighting the rebels
2544129 mula sa bahay dinig na dinig ng pamilya ko ang mga putok ng mortars at 90 rrs di ako maka focus sa aking fight bukas kasi baka umabot sa amin ang mga rebelde sana makatulong ako sa aking mga kababayan na depensahan ang bayan namin from our house gunshots are clearly heard from mortars and 90 rrs i cant focus on my fight tomorrow because the rebels might overrun our place i wish to help my townmates to defend our place

2544131 we are dealing with this situation the best way we can and we are still trying to resort to our other plans

2544134 when the muslims vehemently protested such forum i have with the greatest respect a difficulty to understand the reasons of such protest while we the muslims are entitled to protect and defend our religion we must also in the same vein be just and tolerant in our stand whatever stand we opted it must be based on the principle of fairness

2544137 so dominant that everybody present in the venue applauded him at the end of four rounds of action
2544138 the mobility and attacking skills of plange were so refined that one wondered whether it was the same plange who was in the ring against his bigger nigerian foe while he remained very conscious of his defensive mechanism that made him rather elusive and invisible to his opponent
2544139 we have gone through a series of training denied ourselves pleasures and sacrificed for good results
2544140 have gone through such exercises and thats why i was amazed when sections of the sporting public criticized it
2544141 the difference will be the mental toughness and the willingness to win
2544142 my confidence in these boys is at an all time high
2544143 this is a great showdown and affordable to many almost 75 of tickets are priced between 50 75 making this a very affordable fight for this magnitude
2544144 shane is the gold standard in boxing because he is a fearless and exciting fighter we are very excited to have him fighting at home in los angeles again
2544145 mayorga is a true showman of this sport and he is going down in history as one of the best nicaraguan fighters of all time
2544146 i want to welcome everyone back to the home depot center
2544147 this has been a tremendous year for us at the home depot center we have a fantastic boxing venue and a very intimate stadium and we are excited for september 27th
2544148 there is something great about doing a show in los angeles with the sunny skies overhead
2544149 we have two great multiple time champions the action is fierce and intense
2544150 we at hbo are excited to show this fight just as everyone at the home depot center will be as well there is a lot at stake on september 27th and we know it will be a great night of boxing
2544151 we are excited to come back to fight in los angeles
2544152 it is also great to be fighting against a family of boxers with jack shane and shane jr
2544153 this fight was supposed to happen in the past and it wasnt meant to be but now the fight is on and it is an honor to have this opportunity to fight shane
2544154 ricardo is a showman a great fighter and a world champion
2544155 i want to first thank god for giving me this opportunity to continue fighting
2544156 this is going to be a short fight like in the amateurs only three rounds this will be shanes permanent return home because the old lady needs a home
2544157 i brought these pink gloves for shane to wear during the fight im sending him permanently home
2544158 i will fight a three round fight that is all he will last
2544159 i will knock out shane just like vernon knocked him out
2544160 ill be the man that night and hell be my woman im from the country where we only breed men
2544161 maybe oscar will have the guts to fight me in a rematch after i beat shane up good
2544162 there wont be a lot of blood because im going to beat him good and fast and tell him to go home permanently
2544163 ill put my chin out there for shane and let him hit me with his best left hook and see what happens
2544164 why did he give us these gloves we dont accept them youre present is still your present because we dont accept it so its still yours
2544165 shane is in great shape and im not worried he has been training for a long time and is very passionate and energetic shane is a student of this sport
2544166 if he goes more than three rounds hell be winded and ill knock him out
2544167 i respect him but hes kind of crazy and thats why it will be an entertaining fight for three rounds because he always comes to fight and so do i
2544168 it might go four or five rounds and then after im through with beating mayorga ill be looking forward to fighting margarito
2544169 i dont need the pink everlast gloves you can keep those ill be wearing the red reyes because ill be coming with fire
2544170 its going to be a great night in the ring im ready to go and im still here in this game because i love this sport
2544171 i also want to thank mayorga for taking this fight because i didnt get the opportunity to show my skills with zab
2544172 i fought vargas at 154 because i was fighting at 147 at the time it was a good thing ricardo fought him vargas at 168 because he vargas was out of shape so he ricardo could beat him
2544173 i hope that ricardo remembers what oscar did to him with that left hook he better watch out

2544176 its been eight years since i fought at home and i cant wait to fight at the home depot center
2544177 mayorgas a big talker and i know things are going to heat up between us but ive been down this road before all the talking in the world isnt going to help him when we step into the ring thats where mayorga will have to eat his words
2544178 fernando vargas and all of his supporters in southern california told me i couldnt back up the talk in november but i did
2544179 i will do to mosley exactly what i did to vargas or even worse mosley will have to prove to me he can stand up and fight the way vargas tried to do
2544180 i know mosley and mayorga very well having been in the ring with both of them and in all honesty nothing compares to shanes speed or ricardos power that makes this a perfect clash of styles and one that should result in a great fight when the bell rings
2544181 mayorga too often fights two opponents himself and the other guy shane mosley should pray that mayorga continues to fight two opponents if mayorga fights single mindedly nobody can beat him the only person that can beat mayorga is mayorga i predict mayorga will put on one of the best performances of his life and knock sugar shane mosley out
2544182 bringing shane mosley home to fight in los angeles has been a goal of ours for years and finally that dream has become a reality add in the great reception that ricardo mayorga got when he beat fernando vargas last year in los angeles and im sure this is an event that all fight fans will want to see
2544183 september 27th should be an exciting night of boxing and we are really looking forward to presenting the action live on hbo we have a doubleheader on tap for the evening and there is plenty on the line for all the fighters
2544184 the home depot center and aeg are proud to partner once again with golden boy promotions and don king productions to bring another marquee fight to southern california boxing fans in 2008 the home depot center has hosted two of boxings most storied matchups including vazquez vs marquez iii and de la hoya vs forbes mosley vs mayorga on september 27th will complete the years greatest hat trick in boxing

2544192 mora won the first battle but im going to win the war
2544193 i give him credit for beating me when i was at 45 percent of my ability on september 13th well see what he can do with 100 percent of vernon forrest for anyone who cant wait that long ill cut out the suspense mora doesnt go 12 rounds with me in the rematch
2544194 im disappointed that forrest has made this a personal battle but that will make things even worse for him on fight night
2544195 i was just going to beat him but now im going to have to punish him to show him that my first win wasnt a fluke im the super welterweight champion of the world and undefeated thats not going to change on september 13th
2544196 their first fight was high drama and i expect even more drama and fireworks the second time around
2544197 sergio is a different fighter since he won the title and even though i know vernon will be coming out with all guns blazing i dont see sergio losing for a long long time
2544198 vernon forrest is one of the finest boxers of this era and he will show why on september 13th sergio mora is a fine young fighter but vernon is on another level than he is and we will see him at his spectacular best in this rematch

2544228 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2544229 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2544230 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2544231 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2544232 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2544233 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent the middle income tax rate for middle income americans would have to go up to 66 percent and the top rate which is what small businesses pay would have to go to 88 percent
2544234 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2544235 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2544236 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2544237 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war we got through world war i we got through world war ii we won the war on the great depression
2544238 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2544239 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards
2544240 a roadmap for americas future a plan to solve americas long term fiscal and economic crisis
2544241 why should anything change who cares if people join us or not lets not do that thing you are suggesting because it is too catholic lets have community at the expense of worship prayer and devotion

2544245 theres a relationship between what the prosecution spends and what the defense needs

2544247 i was doing my job and i would do the same things again
2544248 the creature has always been out there and its out there still
2544249 if you travel the ancient trails even today theres a good chance youll meet him
2544250 theres nothing out there in the forest any educated person today knows this
2544251 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2544252 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2544253 i think most people today know this is just a story
2544254 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2544255 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2544256 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2544257 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2544258 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2544259 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2544260 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2544261 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives
2544262 my parents used to talk about it about meeting the huge man in the forest
2544263 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
2544264 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2544265 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2544266 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2544267 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2544268 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2544269 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2544270 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2544271 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2544272 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2544273 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2544274 this work of seeking to lead people to faith in christ and of trying to help them lead holy lives is impossible for us but god is at work doing what we can never do
2544275 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
2544276 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
2544277 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
2544278 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
2544279 it concerns not only georgia it concerns the u s and its values we are a freedom loving country which is being attacked
2544280 we ask our friends including the u s to be mediators and try persuading russia to stop this military aggression and incursion into georgia
2544281 it is the third genocide of the ossetian people from the side of georgia and saakashvili is the main murderer
2544282 irrespective of the development of situation in south ossetia we wont stop moving to the border with georgia today they launch a military aggression against south ossetia and tomorrow it could be abkhazia it cannot go on like that
2544283 we are extremely concerned with the latest developments and we think that it is very regrettable that there has been loss of lives the most urgent thing at the moment is to calm the situation down

2544309 were not going to use the dremel on the chicken
2544310 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
2544311 the group is open to all women who have a nationalist patriotic world view
2544312 there had been no indications that she was involved in the far right scene nothing in her conversation or her work
2544313 i was accused of indoctrinating children something that is totally out of keeping with the way i do things with my convictions with my beliefs
2544314 she was a woman who felt called to free her country and that is also something close to our hearts
2544315 many women dont know where to look for help or how to defend themselves
2544316 i am now trying to get funding at a state level and from the european union
2544317 the poor german people suffering because of oppression that is a constant rhetorical device
2544318 one has to keep in mind the long term goals of a party like the npd or other extreme right groups
2544319 its not really about intensifying or improving democracy but rather about limiting it and creating an authoritarian society
2544320 they themselves have a racist anti semitic homophobic and anti feministic view of mankind
2544321 they have always been there but before they were usually in the background
2544322 even if they claim that their work is non political they still convey a certain stance
2544323 children and young people have a right to receive an education and pedagogy that respects people without either open or subtle discrimination
2544324 you cannot separate her work from the fact that she was involved in a xenophobic organization
2544325 it fits totally with the idea of ethnopluralism the idea that various ethnicities and peoples are so different that they shouldnt mix
2544326 these women appear very moderate and eloquent friendly and supportive
2544327 that does not mean that they dont have a racist ideology
2544328 that doesnt make them any less dangerous quite the opposite
2544329 yi has improved tremendously and he can limit nowitzki and i can take care of kaman
2544330 i have high expectations to play for new jersey it will be a new team a new atmosphere and a new beginning for me
2544331 the nets worked hard to get me and i feel honored
2544332 they play a fast tempo and are younger i think i can be part of the rotation in no time
2544333 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2544334 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2544335 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2544336 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2544337 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2544338 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2544339 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2544340 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2544341 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2544342 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2544343 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2544344 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2544345 when i get a chance to play golf or go on a boat with good people take the boat out and put some lobsters on the grill get the ice cold beer and the cigars thats heaven here on earth
2544346 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2544347 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2544348 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2544349 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2544350 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2544351 if julia had worn this one she would have gotten richard to commit much faster
2544352 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2544353 that girl with the foot pain who is always limping
2544354 ha ha theyre a newbie look theyre wearing boots suckers
2544355 that limping american girl with the very good spanish and the italian boyfriend
2544356 we didnt see you today and we were wondering if youd stopped because of your feet how nice youve made it
2544357 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2544358 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2544359 when technology improves a book that was already good thats good news for nerds

2544372 at last count the religious right is 30 million religiously motivated conservative voters according to exit and postelection polling data we can conclude that they are roughly 23 million evangelical and conservative mainline christians and 6 9 million conservative catholics they represent the growing wings of their respective denominations and faith traditions they are black white and brown they live in parts north south east and west they are wealthy middle class and poor they are highly educated and poorly educated they are in short americans

2544389 um jornalista devidamente preparado em um curso superior obt m conhecimentos que lhe capacitam para
2544390 na minha avalia o levando em conta as complexidades e liberdades do mundo atual e o que ele exige do jornalismo o ingresso na profiss o de jornalista deveria ser acess vel a quaisquer cidad os no pleno uso dos seus direitos desde que provem ter forma o superior conclu da com exce o das atividades em que tal exig ncia seja descabida precisariam por m passar por um per odo de est gio ou experi ncia probat ria no m nimo seis meses no m ximo um ano com a devida remunera o e com a obriga o de nesse per odo fazerem estudos sobre jornalismo com orienta o pedag gica
2544391 restritivo demais pensar s no jornalismo como centro da discuss o midi tica
2544392 acredito que hoje o diploma represente uma reserva de legitima o dos sindicatos
2544393 creio que o diploma j foi importante mas n o mais as escolas de comunica o precisam vender qualidade e n o reserva de mercado para um determinado profissional
2544394 se a exig ncia do diploma acabasse amanh os cursos de comunica o continuariam iguais os cursos que fazem a diferen a dentro da forma o desse profissional continuam formando profissionais de qualidade o que muda e o que acaba s o os cursos que realmente vendiam apenas o diploma
2544395 primero habr a que poner esto en perspectiva hist rica no podemos colocar a las carreras de comunicaci n al nivel del desarrollo tanto interno de otros saberes como de la definici n de los haceres de profesiones con carreras como econom a por ejemplo stas llevan muchos a os por delante de nosotros legitim ndose como saberes y despu s configurando diferentes oficios en esto no hay que ser masoquistas las nuestras no tienen el m nimo de tiempo para legitimarse como saber porque estamos en una encrucijada en la cual decir comunicaci n hoy es decir una palabra absolutamente clave de la modernizaci n del mundo de la configuraci n de las sociedades modernas
2544396 nuestro reto est en darnos cuenta de que juntar comunicaci n y periodismo es juntar dos cosas que hoy d a tienen muy poco que ver porque del periodismo se puede hacer una historia muy corta a trav s de dos modelos por un lado est el de periodismo como espacio de debate propio del siglo xix y por otro lado aparece el modelo period stico norteamericano que hace de la informaci n el objetivo de un peri dico como espacio en donde se debat an las concepciones de los social y en el que no hab a partido pol tico por peque o que fuera que no tuviera el suyo hemos pasado a un tipo de periodismo basado en la informaci n

2544432 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2544433 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2544439 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2544440 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2544774 the way banks create money is so simple the mind is repelled
2544775 i have never yet had anyone who could through the use of logic and reason justify the federal government borrowing the use of its own money it is absolutely wrong for government to issue interest bearing obligations it is not only wrong it is absolutely unnecessary i believe the system should be changed the constitution of the united states does not give the banks the power to create money the constitution says that congress shall have the power to create money i believe the time will come when people will demand that this be changed i believe the time will come in this country when they will actually blame you and me and everyone else connected with this congress for sitting idly by and permitting such an idiotic system to continue

2544779 the congress shall have power to coin money regulate the value thereof and of ofreign coin
2544780 no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal coin money emit bills of credit make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts
2544781 no state shall enter into any treaty alliance or confederation grant letters of marque and reprisal coin money emit bills of credit paper money make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts pass any bill of attainder ex post facto law or law impairing the obligation of contracts or grant any title of nobility
2544782 power to coin money and regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin
2544783 the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the peiople

2544865 i think its a combination of things getting some time off is good although i would prefer to be in the car every week but that didnt happen
2544866 a lot has got to do with the guys who really came up with a good car for this road course

2544877 after our midweek disappointment it was always going to be a difficult game for us
2544878 so i am just pleased to go on and win it
2544879 it wasnt an easy day for us and indeed it was never going to be an easy day
2544880 when were on the competition ground the best thing to do is just to live up to our own standards we cant pay attention to judging issues

2544893 but we know what a step up next week against the all blacks will be and we have the ability to make that step

2544895 argentina were very physical at the breakdown points but we were happy with the way we went in the lineouts and scrums
2544896 argentina uses a lot of lineout drives but with the sacking rule coming in with the elvs experimental law variations it made it very difficult for them
2544897 its important that there be a place that candidates can come and start and have a chance
2544898 you cant come with an entourage you have to be willing to do the one one one
2544899 but if we focused on those early states where people actually get a chance to talk to you and get to know you we had a chance

2544902 in new hampshire you can hang out with all of them
2544903 its said in a joking way but in new hampshire you dont vote for someone unless youve shaken their hand at least three times
2544904 it totally makes sense who wouldnt want a chance to get up close to the person who could become the next president
2544905 i told them youre part of history you heard possibly the next president of the united states not many people can say that
2544906 if people here had lost interest i would say we need to be replaced but look around there are people making it a priority to be here they take their personal responsibility seriously

2544910 and why we not look how old we are why would you doubt us
2544911 florida didnt really do anything to new hampshire he said over lunch
2544912 its outrageous to have political insiders deciding whether candidates can talk to voters in other states
2544913 ive been through these election hassles thats the penalty for living in new hampshire quipped vietnam vet
2544914 its like the weather if you dont like it move

2544944 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result

2545001 it felt like i had sat in a sauna for half an hour it was just so humid
2545002 that was even before i got on the bike there was just no way to ventilate your body even when you get out of beijing it doesnt really change
2545003 the american men do not have a chance at a gold medal and i would actually say they dont have a chance at a medal right now
2545004 everyone is on the same page and we each feed off of each other
2545005 prodavaonice mogu od ponedjeljka do subote zapo eti s radom najranije u 6 sati a zavr iti s radom najkasnije do 21 sat
2545006 you know mommy at the store that store with the thing the store where you asked the guy do you have any more ipods that store
2545007 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network
2545008 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2545009 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2545010 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2545011 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2545012 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2545013 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2545014 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2545015 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked and i guarantee you its going to happen again i promise you
2545016 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2545017 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2545018 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2545019 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2545020 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2545021 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2545022 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2545023 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2545024 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife

2545053 the japanese government must strongly demand complete abolishment of nuclear weapons in north korea
2545054 it should seriously consider the creation of a northeast asian nuclear weapon free zone
2545055 india whose nuclear cooperation with the united states is a cause of concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2545056 well they still agree with me there has to be something to my point even if i dont know what it is right now

2545096 viola es dos acordos anteriores de paz e cessar fogo
2545097 uma tentativa de envolver outros pa ses e povos em suas sanguin rias aventuras
2545098 acho que isso agora bvio tanto na ge rgia e na r ssia quanto no resto do mundo
2545099 as a es das autoridades georgianas na oss tia do sul s o certamente um crime e antes de tudo um crime contra seu pr prio povo
2545100 dif cil imaginar como depois do ocorrido e do que est ocorrendo convencer a oss tia do sul a fazer parte do estado georgiano
2545101 a agress o provocou v rias v timas entre a popula o civil o que desembocou de fato em uma aut ntica cat strofe humana

2545103 a great metaphor is when people say that theyre burned out
2545104 because when youre overworked your acid levels go through the roof
2545105 but there is one area that we do have control over what we eat
2545106 it is the balance of these foods that is important
2545107 being too acidic promotes the development of chronic illnesses viruses and bacteria which thrive in this setting
2545108 the attacks are occurring in georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia and mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2545109 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2545110 whatever site is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this site is not safe and they should know this
2545111 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2545112 cynical mr saakashvili must do two things he must withdraw all forces from south ossetia and sign a legally binding document to never use force against south ossetia again
2545113 have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out
2545114 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2545115 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2545116 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2545117 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2545118 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2545119 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2545120 these are the best facilities ive competed in and the nicest dorms definitely
2545121 the athletes village is cool theres like grass and sculptures everywhere its a really nice environment
2545122 los partidos de pretemporada son tiles si los sabes aprovechar y jugar frente a un equipo con ritmo alto porque esta a una semana de empezar su liga y viendo las sensaciones que nos ha dejado me he quedado muy conforme de lo que ha hecho el equipo
2545123 me gustaron muchos los ltimos 25 minutos de la primera parte ya no s lo por el trato de bal n y la llegada sino tambi n en la recuperaci n tuvimos muchas opciones empatamos el partido y pudimos incluso haber hecho algo m s
2545124 there is a place where people live love laugh and learn a place where the wind can bite you just like a snake but a place where you will always feel at home my home chicago illinois
2545125 i shoved a letter about queens landing into his hand
2545126 i was also able to squelch a plan someone had to set up replicas of the gates of buckingham palace at queens landing my point is that we must look to the architects of the 21st century not the 19th
2545127 we are always open to ideas or discussions about ways to move the project forward
2545128 sai da escola porque meu pai ficou desempregado e eu j tinha idade para ajudar no sustento da casa
2545129 enquanto eu puder pagar os estudos dele quero ver meu filho na escola
2545130 s vezes eu tenho que dar uma dura nele porque ele pregui oso para estudar prefere ficar na rua com os amigos
2545131 fora da minha realidade gastar 50 reais para ver um filme mas eu bem que gostaria

2545133 tax reform is desperately needed in the united states but before we can reform the tax code we must sharply reduce the tax burden on americans made necessary second we need a tax code that makes taxation fairer and simpler for all citizens meaningful tax reform begins with reining in government spending
2545134 i dont want tax increases but that doesnt mean that anything is off the table
2545135 i think the best way to approach this is to adjust the cap on the payroll tax so that people like myself are paying a little bit more and people who are in need are protected
2545136 the american people simply cannot afford more of the same which means more government spending more special interest pay offs more fraud and waste and continuing to treat american taxpayers like geese to be plucked rather than citizens of a free society and democratic republic
2545137 sen john mccain r az the presumptive republican nominee would swell annual federal outlays by 68 5 billion almost 10 times the amount he was backing in january
2545138 obamas annual spending platform 343 6 billion has increased by about 20 percent since january 29 287 0 billion and by about 12 percent since march 3 307 2 billion
2545139 the individuals right to keep and bear arms helps ensure all of our freedoms the supreme courts recognition of the constitutional right to gun ownership is a recognition of the right to life liberty and property for all americans
2545140 mccain is one of the premier flag carriers for enemies of the second amendment
2545141 before obama became a national political figure he sat on the board of a chicago based foundation that doled out at least nine grants totaling nearly 2
2545142 america should not be the worlds policeman the american purpose is to provide a strong national defense not to engage in nation building or to launch foreign crusades no matter how seemingly well intentioned
2545143 as president i would pursue a new strategy and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in afghanistan we need more troops
2545144 neither the republicans nor the democrats can be trusted to protect the privacy and civil liberties of the american people as president i would never forget that it is a free society which we must defend we must never sacrifice the individual freedoms that make america so unique
2545145 mccain believes that neither the administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people except for the a c l u and trial lawyers understand were constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on sept 11 2001
2545146 the ability to monitor and track individuals who want to attack the united states is a vital counter terrorism tool and im persuaded that it is necessary to keep the american people safe particularly since certain electronic surveillance orders will begin to expire later this summer given the choice between voting for an improved yet imperfect bill and losing important surveillance tools ive chosen to support the current compromise
2545147 we must address the issue of climate change but do so realistically recognizing the importance of simultaneously expanding energy supplies and maintaining economic growth our greatest strength in confronting the problems of the future is our free market economy only by reducing government barriers to private research and development are we going to achieve the innovative even transformational changes necessary in the years and decades ahead
2545148 in fact if the market is your favored mechanism mr mccains endorsement of a cap and trade system is the worst choice for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2545149 e se invece silente voleva che capissimo il simbolo in tempo per prendere la bacchetta
2545150 e se scoprire il significato del simbolo ti avrebbe reso degno di prendere i doni

2545154 this is not for fusion artists this is not for confusion artists
2545155 you have to practice to play this kind of music
2545156 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2545157 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2545158 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2545159 in the departments view customizing the number of hours days weeks and years attributed to a working life on an industry specific basis most closely hews to congresss intent in directing the secretary to set standards based upon the best available evidence and upon consideration of the latest available scientific data
2545160 those numerical quantities are meaningful only in the context of some distribution that arises when variability and uncertainty are taken into consideration a central estimate and a risk range might be misleading in situations when sensitive populations are of primary concern
2545161 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2545162 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2545163 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2545164 sabemos que no podemos dar ventajas asi que estas dos semanas trabajamos sobre los errores que cometimos durante los partidos anteriores y pensando en estas tres finales cada punto es importante asi que encaramos estos partidos pensando en la victoria
2545165 the attacks are occurring in georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia and mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2545166 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6
2545167 whatever site is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this site is not safe and they should know this

2545169 cynical mr saakashvili must do two things he must withdraw all forces from south ossetia and sign a legally binding document to never use force against south ossetia again
2545170 have fully liberated tskhinvali of georgian armed forces and started pushing georgian units out

2545173 we had a court we had a jury it was a military jury they heard the evidence they gave him five months
2545174 last week the navy announced that one of its nuclear powered submarines the uss houston had leaked minimally radioactive water earlier this year an investigation showed water may have been slowly leaking from the valve since march as the los angeles class submarine traveled around the pacific
2545175 the screen is fabulous you would expect that with a screen there would be a glare it would be hard to read but its not theres no glare its not backlit which is kind of magical i think people are going to be very very surprised and delighted this is a lot easier to read than a lot of books are these days
2545176 im telling you after five minutes ive ceased to think im looking at a screen its not like reading a computer screen its more like reading a piece of paper i think its actually clearer easier on the eye than the printed word
2545177 its like paper and its very interesting its very very crisp very functional very readable
2545178 no way what a joke that must be an early balsa wood mock up
2545179 youre a tough guy and your wife is a obscenity
2545180 im going to come over and slap your wife around
2545181 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2545182 the underlying mechanisms for this protective effect of black tea on parkinsons disease remain unclear until further research is done
2545183 but drinking even one cup of black tea per day could help to reduce the risk of parkinsons disease
2545184 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it

2545187 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2545188 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2545189 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2545190 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2545191 officials emphasize that no missiles will be test fired at the planes
2545192 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2545193 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2545194 it is absolutely amazing inside it is like he said this is exactly what i want money is no object it must have cost hundred and hundreds of thousands of pounds the whole place is amazingly ostentatious and fun
2545195 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
2545196 it needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problem and not contributing to it
2545197 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2545198 the first thing needed is to make the georgians return to their positions and re establish the status quo we had before
2545199 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2545200 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
2545201 georgian authorities support a cease fire and separation of the warring parties
2545202 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2545203 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2545204 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2545205 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2545549 heres what i think cheaper is the last refuge of the person whos not a very good marketer cheaper is easy and cheaper is fast and cheaper is linear and cheaper is easy to do properly at least at first but cheaper doesnt spread the word unless you are much cheaper but to be much cheaper you need to be organized from the ground up like walmart or jetblue to be cheaper they are youre not cheaper is a short term hit not a long term advantage cheaper doesnt create loyalty because the other guy can always figure out how to be cheaper still at least in the short run even free isnt cheap enough to win in the long run not if other people can figure out how to match what youve got so if you cant be cheaper be better

2545575 the simple fact that it was sex that brought this out is irrelevant if edwards had been caught embezzling from his charities or what not would you have claimed that it is none of the publics business
2545576 edwards choose to put himself in the public eye he then choose to play a dangerous game where he would have had to know what the outcome would be
2545577 this isnt about sex as much as the left would want to paint it that way its about honor honesty and integrity edwards doesnt show any of these qualities it just so happens that it was the sex that exposed that

2545591 if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
2545592 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
2545593 but not all of the law was taken out of peter while peter was on the housetop
2545594 he fell into a trance and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed that call not thou common this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven
2545595 there is neither jew nor greek for ye are all one in christ jesus
2545596 but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean
2545597 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before of god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead
2545598 if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself
2545599 whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word
2545600 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory
2545601 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
2545602 now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
2545603 that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus
2545604 ephesians 2 7 god sent the flood purpose judgment god instructed noah to build the ark purpose to save those that believed god gave the law purpose to show israel they needed a saviour god sent his son to die on calvary purpose to take away the sins of the world god also gave the gifts of tongues languages to the gentiles in acts 10 for a purpose those who claim acts 10 as their foundation and doctrine for speaking in tongues today must measure up in duplication of those that were spoken that day in caesarea speak with tongues and magnify god
2545605 then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren
2545606 and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren jews accompanied me and we entered into the mans house
2545607 forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god
2545608 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language
2545609 and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god
2545610 and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning
2545611 when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also
2545612 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body
2545613 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus
2545614 after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise
2545615 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life

2545698 and we want to do the best we can so were open to all the opportunities that come our way this time weve had a couple of great chances to work with good people and with some excellent studio players who we really respect
2545699 you can learn so much from people that come in to play with you on records
2545700 like roger manning he came down to play some keys on this record and john brian on the last record these guys really know what theyre doing and you can pick up a lot from them theres definitely a cool school of session musicians who play in los angeles and we had the pleasure of playing with some of the best of them people like dj swamp who plays with beck it was a good thing for us were sponges and we want to learn everything we can
2545701 weve always had this philosophy that we want a song to be as instant as possible and thats determined to some extent how the songs have come about
2545702 the way we approached the songs on this album was by looking at each one on its own and seeing whats best for that song rather than sticking to the overall philosophy
2545703 even though it seems like we have had a long break the opposite is true
2545704 we finished touring overseas in europe and then went on to support inxs for new years eve 2000 basically weve been writing new songs all the time we recorded some demos and began recording in september and october for the new album
2545705 it was a conscious decision by all of us to have a break
2545706 we didnt want to be judged on the last thing we did and we felt that had we followed straight on with another album then thats what wouldve happened
2545707 there hasnt been too much anticipation this time around its definitely exciting to hear the single is doing well with radio but its the charts that you keep your eye on thats when you know if the public like the song or not when we do instore shows if the public perception is good then you know you are on the right track at this particular time we dont know if anyone likes it thats why the instore promos are good because you get feedback
2545708 freds role was an interesting one he would make suggestions like putting in longer bridges in a particular song he kept searching for the next level and helped us develop our arrangements
2545709 when he offers an opinion youd listen but that doesnt mean you have to agree we would try new things and record it sometimes we said yes other times we said no sometimes wed go full circle
2545710 i think if you had to be in america during that time as we where then venice beach was as good a place as any to be the surrealness of venice beach definitely helped take our minds off it but it was always in the back of your mind youd be watching the skies and taking threats seriously says tim wild but at the same time when youve got a turban wearing guitar playing rollerblading salesman trying to hock his wares to you you tend to forget about it temporarily

2545728 slates mickey kaus has been foremost among the latter alternately analyzing and speculating on the enquirers reporting and ridiculing the mainstream media for a fastidiousness that has seemed from the start wholly absurd like other commentators he repeatedly alleged that a double standard that favored democrats applied to the story like the enquirers reporting the special treatment charge is largely true as anyone who recalls the media frenzy over conservative commentator and former cabinet secretary william bennetts high stakes gambling would agree

2545785 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2545786 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2545787 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2545788 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2545789 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2545790 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2545791 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men

2545798 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
2545799 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple

2545802 cheney has not sought a speaking slot at the convention nor has his staff sought a role for him at the convention
2545803 the vice president has a great deal of respect for john mccain and as of last friday was out campaigning for him
2545804 claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein

2545813 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock

2545818 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2545819 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2545820 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2545821 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2545822 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2545823 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2545824 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network

2545827 at least eight in ten americans believe the nation is on the wrong track the republican president is historically unpopular from stunning democratic gains in party registration to the high levels of economic anxiety obama should have a healthy lead by almost every measure yet in poll after poll obama conspicuously fails to cross the 50 percent threshold
2545828 my campaign has uncovered evidence that my opponent jim martin did not want senator barack obama to be president of the united states and that jim martin voted against barack obama in the february 2008 presidential primary election in georgia
2545829 what will happen at the convention in respect to my putting my name into nomination a roll call vote and the usual kind of process that occurs at conventions i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2545830 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
2545831 obama gaggled with reporters on his plane between minneapolis and chicago when asked about reports of angry hillary supporters obama said were not talking to those people and were talking to directly to the clinton campaign people and it has gone seamlessly
2545832 mr mccain has beat mr obamas channel for seven straight days and 11 of the past 14 days in a signal he intends to compete for the youtube vote
2545833 that not only in that mccain ad were there two underdressed blondes mixed with the black guy in the ad but there are also images of the leaning tower of pisa the washington monument and the victory column in berlin as bob herbert put it
2545834 comparing the democratic presidential hopeful to celebrities britney spears and paris hilton
2545835 to a certain extent the ads are having some effect but you cant be thrown off your game plan by a momentary dip in polls
2545836 after years of battling with president clinton house republicans are shifting their sights to vice president al gore and
2545837 former democratic presidential candidate mike gravel was caught on tape last week telling a crowd in washington d c that they should harass a federal prosecutor who helped bring criminal contempt charges against a palestinian activist find out where he lives find out where his kids go to school find out where his office is picket him all the time gravel said in an audio tape obtained by the investigative project on terrorism and provided to fox news
2545838 im not suggesting a five year war has helped things necessarily although the reconstruction has but most of the damage that was done to the iraqi infrastructure was done well before the u s came
2545839 it looks at first like any other shuttered storefront near the boardwalk some garish lettering and a cartoonish invitation to a delight or a scam in this case theres spongebob squarepants saying it dont gitmo better
2545840 in reflection of how critical it has become for the us military to retain native language and cultural know how in its ranks
2545841 never even said theres a link between al qaeda and iraq
2545842 obama cant point to a single instance in which sean hannity or talk radio
2545843 3 4 increase in single copy newsstand sales for the first half of 2008
2545844 if the roll call of the states is conducted she might might still win
2545845 it is unlikely a running mate will be selected before the candidate returns from a weeks holiday in hawaii which starts this friday that leaves about 10 days until the start of the democratic party convention in denver
2545846 in addition to michelle obama the candidates inner circle consists of just three people david axelrod his senior strategist david plouffe his campaign manager and robert gibbs a senior adviser all three are intensely loyal and discreet obama professionals
2545847 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
2545848 one third of his record breaking haul has come from donations of 1 000 or more a total of 112 million more than senator john mccain mr
2545849 behind those larger donations is a phalanx of more than 500 obama bundlers fund raisers who have each collected contributions totaling 50 000 or more many of the bundlers come from industries with critical interests in washington nearly three dozen of the bundlers have raised more than 500 000 each including more than a half dozen who have passed the 1 million mark and one or two who have exceeded 2 million according to interviews with fund raisers
2545850 i firmly disagree that a racial reading of chozicks story is ridiculous and i would counter that any failure on chozicks part to recognize such is just a wee bit clueless
2545851 if youve got michelle as first lady and malia and sasha running around on the south lawn that changes how america looks at itself
2545852 barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
2545853 if barack obama draws bigger crowds lets have more obama coverage
2545854 the current outsized attention obamas getting notably the three tv networks anchoring their news coverage from his recent international tour seems a market savvy response to audience interest
2545855 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2545856 is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol

2545860 nbc nightly news devoted more than two minutes out of its total of 22 minutes or so of news time to this story
2545861 we are at war the economy is in the tank no one can afford gas in the tank but two minutes was given to this mouse research
2545862 my status has not changed although in a technical way it has i am on call to the editor of the post when they deem that they need reporting and editing from me
2545863 obviously were not the first newspaper to be affected by the continuing downturn in advertising
2545864 we are hopeful that by opting for our employees to voluntarily sign up for buyouts we can avoid any type of layoffs going forward
2545865 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
2545866 given the cutbacks planned at the js i was told they could no longer justify having a full time editorial cartoonist although im taking the buyout im not going willingly im being forced out
2545867 playgirl is going all web the last print issue will be the jan feb 2009 magazine which comes out nov 18
2545868 the republican also has pulled ahead on the issue of balancing the federal budget
2545869 in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate
2545870 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2545871 the activities of many organizations of the civil rights era
2545872 dr kings type of resistance to the u s version of apartheid could surely be considered homegrown terrorism
2545873 supreme arbiters of which ideas parties and candidates are permitted to effectively compete in the public arena
2545874 our politics has gotten so ah nasty thats the word i was looking for
2545875 but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative right so im happy to have a battle of words because ive got facts on my side
2545876 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side
2545877 we have sensed a lack of enthusiasm from the obama camp
2545878 stephanopoulos a gentleman named william ayers he was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that can you explain your relationship to him for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
2545879 in may when a mccain adviser proposed a series of pre convention appearances at town hall meetings obama said i think thats a great idea obviously we would have to think through the logistics on that but if i have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with john mccain thats something that i am going to welcome
2545880 there is an image right there in that very beginning of the leaning tower of pisa and there is an image of the washington monument

2545974 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2545992 for every artist that is successful theres been the first dj that broke their record and the djs that have carried them throughout their careers through good times and bad the r i a a wants to come down on djs for mix tapes and things of that nature the dj has always helped the artist and a lot of the artists get the recognition all the time its just different things that we want to structure for the djs because we are the true tastemakers within the music industry
2545993 the music business is suffering as a result of piracy and over saturation djs need to come together and strive for change why is there no category for the dj at the grammy awards why is the r i a a coming down on djs for mix tapes if it wasnt for djs no music would ever reach the public were the ones that first told you about these artists we need to structure a trade labor union for djs so that we can all comfortably provide for our families as with any other profession im sure the owners of most nightclubs would feel differently if they began to receive calls from management stating that there was a giant inflatable rat posted outside of their venue most djs dont even have medical benefits this is a problem artists and record labels are making anywhere from thousands to millions of dollars off the work of djs most djs will never see reparation record labels need to look to hire more reputable djs to handle their tasks after all djs are the ones that have the ties to the mass public i speak on behalf of the dj community in hopes that that the music industry can continue to be productive and profitable for all of us we all need to help each other in many ways piracy is an epidemic but its only part of the problem djs need to take a stand financially as far as a minimum pay rate that is accepted to perform on any occasion all these issues will be addressed but change takes time help take the first step towards change amongst the dj community we need to solidify our future before someone else does it for us

2546014 permit me to issue and control the money of a nation and i care not who makes the laws
2546015 the bolshevik revolution in russia was the work of jewish planning and jewish dissatisfaction our plan is to have a new world order what worked so wonderfully in russia is going to become reality for the whole world

2546084 in the months leading up to the 2001 anthrax scare bruce e ivins had sought help from a psychiatrist started taking antidepressants and repeatedly told a friend he was frightened by bouts of paranoia and depression
2546085 one would think that employees within a weapons laboratory would pay careful attention to the behavioral signs of their co workers and appropriately report those concerns
2546086 no one wants to report on a colleague and friend but were dealing with life and death situations scrutiny should be stricter
2546087 im really the only scary one in the group others are talking about how sad they are or scared they are but my reaction to the wtc pentagon events is far different of course i dont talk about how i really feel with them it would just make them worse seeing how differently i reacted than they did to the recent events makes me really think about myself a lot
2546088 he has been this way for a number of years and was still able to carry on his professional life at usamriid

2546090 the federal bureau of investigation on wednesday outlined a pattern of bizarre and deceptive conduct by bruce e ivins an army microbiologist who killed himself last week presenting a sweeping but circumstantial case that he was solely responsible for mailing the deadly anthrax letters that killed five people in 2001
2546091 it was an explanation of why bruce ivins was a suspect
2546092 but theres a total absence of proof that he committed this crime
2546093 multiple searches of dr ivinss house and cars turned up not a spore of anthrax the lawyers said and perusal of thousands of his e mail messages turned up no indication that he planned to commit the crime or pleasure or regret at having committed it moreover months of work uncovered no evidence that dr ivins had traveled to princeton n j where investigators believe the letters were mailed the closest connection was that a chapter house of kappa kappa gamma a sorority with which dr ivins had a long and strange obsession is located near the contaminated princeton mailbox
2546094 ivins had been prescribed various psychotropic medications including antidepressants antipsychotics and anti anxiety drugs from 2000 through 2006
2546095 he was an interesting character funny always outgoing a real hard worker
2546096 if you asked me to make a list of the six nuttiest people there bruce wouldnt even hit it
2546097 i wish i could control the thoughts in my mind
2546098 its hard enough sometimes controlling my behavior when im being eaten alive inside i always try to put on a good front here at work and at home
2546099 i get incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and theres nothing i can do until they go away either by themselves or with drugs
2546100 he said well they told my family that i was a murderer
2546101 what he said was my therapist is revealing all my private conversations to the fbi
2546102 somewhat prone to hyperbole when you talked with him youd have to sift through what he was saying to get to the truth of it
2546103 one glass of wine and it would make him really goofy
2546104 bruce was like the guy that was yelling at the top of his lungs
2546105 he loved it and we liked to have him there
2546106 he was very clumsy and could not hit the broad side of a barn
2546107 the picture sometimes gets painted that he was some sort of timothy mcveigh type person
2546108 he liked to be with people he liked to be part of the group
2546109 bruce has been an absolute manic basket case the last few days
2546110 im the other half of bruce when he lets me out
2546111 i push bruce aside them then im free to run about
2546112 that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
2546113 it was an explanation of why bruce ivins was a suspect
2546114 but theres a total absence of proof that he committed this crime
2546115 we were able to determine that at no time could that individual be put in the presence of that flask from which these spores came
2546116 could provide no legitimate reason for the extended hours other than home was not good and he went there to escape from his life at home
2546117 significant since all of the anthrax laden letters were sent to
2546118 we have a flask thats effectively the murder weapon from which those spores were taken that was controlled by dr ivins
2546119 other scientists helped him create that anthrax and worked with it constantly
2546120 it is hard not to be convinced with what they have
2546121 it is mostly all circumstantial but they just have so much evidence i just cant see it being anybody else
2546122 its important that the f b i go on to release the scientific details
2546123 there are some pieces of evidence that are much more compelling than others and a number of loose ends that havent been tied
2546124 this ruling rightly recognizes that parents have an intrinsic right to control their childrens education as well as safeguard their mental and physical well being
2546125 the application of these changes affects transactions where a relocation company as the original contract purchaser assigns it rights to an ultimate purchase but never acquires record title to the property an individual contract purchaser who assigns his or her rights to an entity whether or not that entity is owned in whole or in part by the individual
2546126 postmodernism which helps to explain further how families and especially how boys came to be in such a mess
2546127 the gross injustice to men deserves our concern but save your tears for innocent women our daughters did not deserve the inheritance of malice and spite that my generation of women heaped upon the shoulders of men
2546128 a six year old kissing another six year old is inappropriate behavior unwelcome in unwelcome at any age
2546129 it is moronic to continue insisting that one sex is the victor while the other is the victim which besides being untrue is dastardly in effect
2546130 i dont see google ads pop up very often when i use the search engine in south africa
2546131 no one knows the answer to the question how much time can you be away from your kids and not damage them how much time can you work keep your kid in daycare this show is daycare on steroids laughs the part that was hardest for me to watch as a parent was the toddler section when you know the kids are consciously feeling the separation anxiety but the parents were going in and out all the time we met all the borrowed kids and they seem as healthy as can be but at the end of the day we dont know thats the bottom line

2546133 since ive been here adams probably hit the ball better than anyone
2546134 so i thought hey lets move him up there move him up a little bit at a time put him in the fourth spot and hope he can drive in some runs for us
2546135 hes stuck to his plan most of the time he has a plan when he walks up to the plate and he sticks with it
2546136 i think he can handle it ive moved him up a little bit at a time and hes handled every spot that ive put him
2546137 it certainly lets him know that i have a lot of confidence in him and believe in what hes doing
2546138 without putting a lot of pressure on him i just told him to be himself
2546139 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2546140 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2546141 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2546142 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2546143 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2546144 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2546145 its an amazing feeling any time you get to play in an historic park like this one its an amazing feeling
2546146 why not take full advantage of it and do everything you can to remember this day
2546147 i would take pictures all day long if i could
2546148 wonderful feeling its always fun to play with brothers or even best friends in this game
2546149 i like to see what hes doing he likes to see what im doing im just trying to keep up with him each day and make sure were doing what we need to be doing
2546150 i try to do my best so that my brother has somebody to go by and someone to look up to

2546154 surjeet is not among us but his principles will always remain with us we hope that we can continue to work for the development of the country along with those who believe in his thoughts
2546155 comrade surjeet worked throughout his life to tilt national politics in the favour of farmers and the weaker sections of society he was also instrumental in the formation of three third front governments at the centre
2546156 i had a long association with surjeet with whom i shared a father son relationship
2546157 a great leader and a great worker and the void left by his demise will never be filled

2546165 nobody other than microsoft can do net 100 accurately yet
2546166 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2546167 acting within our peacekeeping mission and in line with the mandate issued by the international community russia is engaged in the task of forcing the georgian side to accept peace while defending the lives and property of its citizens as is required under the constitution and laws of the russian federation and the legal standards of any civilized country
2546168 i do not rule out that the hague and strasbourg courts and institutions in other cities will be involved in investigating these crimes and this inhuman drama that has been played out
2546169 were killed by their own georgian partners in the peacekeeping forces
2546170 there is a russian battalion an ossetian battalion and a georgian battalion and all of a sudden the georgians georgian peacekeepers begin shooting their russian colleagues this is of course a war crime
2546171 we are not fighting peaceful towns and are not conducting military strikes against civilians we are only seeking to ensure peace
2546172 what is the cost of an intermediate range ballistic missle
2546173 a fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject
2546174 how the u s economy resembles a very big business
2546175 gives the bush administration the dubious distinction of having run up the largest deficits in our nations history it can try to blame these results on factors beyond its control but it cannot escape comparison with its predecessor
2546176 close to the amount the agency projected last march after accounting for proposed supplemental appropriations
2546177 there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president 90 percent of the time
2546178 the tenor of this race aided by events has changed mccain is on the defensive
2546179 because americas relations with a host of countries are intricately tied to fannie and freddie
2546180 americans future ability to gain access to credit if foreign companies and governments abandon united states investments home auto and credit card loans will be much more difficult to come by
2546181 we know what we have to do were just not sure how to pay for it well have to pry some additional money from the feds
2546182 we face in this country unparalleled challenges both here and abroad and these require a knowledgeable and nimble federal government that can respond effectively with concerns growing about our mounting federal deficit and national debt the american people deserve to know that every dollar we send to washington is being used to its utmost potential
2546183 well i dont know what your saying i dont understand
2546184 we will give you a credit your new balance is 40
2546185 well hes just going to tell you the same thing
2546186 never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity
2546187 we can rise together and form a new kind of government
2546188 we will pledge to return to core moral principles like stewardship service to others personal responsibility shared sacrifice and shared opportunity for everybody
2546189 we have several potentially big customers say they wont use puppet gt because of the gpl
2546190 however they have said that they gt would work with us if we had a bsd style license
2546191 we dont have any customers who say they wouldnt work with us if we gt were bsd instead of gpl we do have many who say they wouldnt if we gt were gpl instead of bsd for us we would prefer for a license to be gt less controversial not more
2546192 the v10 pocket projector has achieved significant interest amongst some of australias largest retailers and we are discussing commercial arrangements with retailers now we expect sales of the pocket projector to be high particularly as we approach the christmas period there is nothing like the pocket projector on the market today it is a true hybrid product that can be used for both business and leisure given the success of devices such as the iphone we expect the projector will fit well into this market
2546193 our exclusive distribution agreement with aiptek is gaining traction and the additional products in our suite are performing well we are confident that as we grow our sales channels and continue to cultivate relationships with market leading retailers we will see significant new revenue streams come online
2546194 but this conflict is about much more than simply which flag flies over a tiny chunk of territory in the caucasus georgia is an extremely pro american and pro western state and represents the easternmost foothold of american western power it has also been in the russian orbit for the bulk of the past 300 years as such it is the hottest flashpoint in western russian relations which way the territory falls ultimately decides whether russia can determine security concerns that literally fall right on the border of its heartland to put it another way what is being decided here is whether bordering russia and simultaneously being a u s ally is a suicidal combination whichever way this works out the dynamics of the entire region are about to be turned on their head
2546195 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to offshore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama

2546197 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
2546198 you know i dont pay attention to john mccains ads although i do notice he doesnt seem to have anything to say very positive about himself he seems to only be talking about me
2546199 this appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics we have no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2546200 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2546201 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2546202 in our lives there a lot of things we cant control the only thing we can control is ourselves be patient you must be strong

2546223 the clip shows a coffee table in the background upon which six cigarette lighters are resting alongside a substance which looks like heroin on a foil according to the british tabloid it received the video from a friend of the 24 year old singers who also handed over a number of photographs in which winehouse is seen apparently taking drugs with fielder civic
2546224 fielder civic 26 is currently in jail facing trial for grievous bodily harm in addition to conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in another section of the video he asks winehouse to perform a sex act on him in the public stairwell of a hotel

2546226 in a murderous quest aimed at cleansing their turf of snitches and rival gangsters members of one of los angeles countys most vicious latino gangs sometimes killed people just because of their race an investigation found
2546227 authorities say there were 20 murders among more than 80 shootings documented during the gangs rampage in the hardscrabble florence firestone neighborhood exceptional even in an area where gang violence has been commonplace for decades they dont specify the time frame or how many of the killings were racial los angeles has struggled with gang violence for years especially during the wars in the late 1980s and early 90s between the crips and the bloods both black gangs
2546228 latino gangs have gained influence since then as the hispanic population surged
2546229 federal state and local officials worked together to charge 102 men linked to f13 with racketeering conspiracy to murder weapons possession drug dealing and other crimes in terms of people charged its the largest ever federal case involving a southern california gang prosecutors say more than 80 of those indicted are in custody
2546230 but eliminating the gang wont be easy its survived for decades and is believed to have about 2 000 members its reach extends to nevada arizona and into prisons where prosecutors say incarcerated gang leaders were able to order hits on black gangsters f13 isnt the only latino gang linked to racial killings last year four members of the avenues a gang from the highland park area east of downtown los angeles were convicted of hate crimes for killing a black man in what prosecutors called a campaign to drive blacks from that neighborhood and last january authorities announced a crackdown on the 204th street gang following the killing of a 14 year old black girl

2546236 if youre younger than 35 youll probably live long enough to put david levys prediction to the test levy says that by 2050 well be creating robots so lifelike so imbued with human seeming intelligence and emotions as to be nearly indistinguishable from real people and well have sex with these robots some of us will even marry them and it will all be good
2546237 levy lays out his vision of a brave new carnal world in love and sex with robots the evolution of human robot relationships which despite its extended riffs on sex toys through the ages is a snigger free book
2546238 i think its a reasonable assumption levy said in a telephone interview from his home in london
2546239 he lays out his case in a voice thats calm rational almost flat more geeky than goatish if one looks at the advances in technology in the last say 40 or 50 years theyve been immense and the more we learn about the science and the technology the quicker it will be to discover even more within that science i take a pragmatic point of view he said partly because in my original field computer chess that was how the problem was solved not by making machines that thought like chess masters but by making machines that beat chess masters
2546240 similarly levy thinks robots need only simulate human intelligence and emotions to the point that they are absolutely convincing
2546241 if you cant tell whether the thing is man or machine what difference does it make
2546242 are quite clear that they want autonomous robots as soon as possible because they are more cost effective and give a risk free war
2546243 i have worked in artificial intelligence for decades and the idea of a robot making decisions about human termination terrifies me
2546244 robotics systems may have the potential to out perform humans from a perspective of the laws of war and the rules of engagement
2546245 and there are no emotions that can cloud judgment such as anger
2546246 but nowhere is there any consideration of the ethical implications of the weaponisation of these systems
2546247 we have to say where we want to draw the line and what we want to do and then get an international agreement

2546317 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
2546318 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem

2546371 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2546372 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2546373 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2546374 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2546375 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2546376 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2546377 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2546378 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2546379 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2546380 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move

2546386 i have been a church goer all of my life i have never felt this kind of freedom in worship before
2546387 sunday is an amazing experience for me each week and not just because of the music or the sermon or the building or the people its an amazing experience because every week i walk away inspired to look at my life and faith and where it merges and conflicts with the life christ wants for me
2546388 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2546389 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2546390 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2546391 let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith

2546393 the xyz custom shop 2000 is the greatest blues guitar on earth
2546394 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2546395 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2546396 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2546397 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2546398 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2546413 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network
2546414 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2546415 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2546416 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2546417 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2546418 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2546419 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force

2546426 he got the broadway sign hes on the paper every day that must be nice for him
2546427 brett favre has done very well for the packers i just dont think him leaving the packers going to the jets was a great thing you never know with them great quarterback i just dont know if that was a smooth idea im not saying hes going to something bad because i dont really know what the jets got this year but i think he had a pretty good thing with the packers but if they didnt want him back they didnt want him back
2546428 i know one person thats happy this happened is plaxico at first all we read about here was plaxico how we wont read much about plax anymore
2546429 i think hes going to realize the media here is a little different than green bay hes not going to control it
2546430 yeah i didnt see no reason for him to retire besides playing the game 17 plus years he hadnt lost a step his arm his throws everything was the same hes still having fun the week before the nfc championship he was throwing snowballs so he wasnt too frustrated with football i think the jets got a good quarterback on their hands
2546431 yeah he already got a key to the city too actually he didnt im not saying the value of that key has gone down at all it was quite a warm welcome but i think everybody knows that in new york it doesnt last long thats why its such a great city to play for
2546432 the cost of beer living expenses will be a little different my only advice to him is to get an ez pass as quickly as possible
2546433 the giants in new york were always the team i dont think that s going to change but its nice for the jets to get some good publicity it seems like things are positive now for them which is good
2546434 has been good and sometimes very good in his first five nfl seasons but he hasnt become the best to ever play the game and he hasnt even become the best to play the game in the game in his own division shockey has had a nice career and if he ever decides to make off season conditioning with his friend and quarterback eli manning a priority and find a way to stay healthy he may one day live up back page hype but for a guy who came into the league with such a cosmic buzz for somebody who was going to redefine what the tight end position meant hes just another decent player and way overrated

2546436 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2546437 the escalation in fighting is dangerously destabilising and there is also the threat of civilian losses on a large scale
2546438 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict
2546439 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2546440 the uk will be discussing with all our partners how to stop the spread of violence secure a ceasefire and get talks under way
2546441 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2546442 but i do support saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop

2546444 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2546445 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes

2546449 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober
2546450 we were outnumbered when they scored because david van zanten was having treatment for a head knock but that shouldnt matter
2546451 however our midfield didnt want to defend and we got punished certain individuals know what happened and if you have lazy players like that then youre liable to lose goals and we suffered
2546452 players with a lazy streak wont play in my team and this is disappointing i spoke to them about it in the dressing room and it was so obvious that they had to accept it
2546453 people have raised eyebrows about spending more than a million pounds on a player so i was delighted for iain
2546454 it is disappointing overall though as we were the better team throughout
2546455 i know its clich but the performance was more important than the result because we controlled the tempo
2546456 maybe we would never have won the league one title with defending like that but weve never been a strong side in that respect the hardest thing is to create chances and we created lots in terms of character the players passed the test with flying colours they are hurting and thats because we have a winning mentality
2546457 we were not as fluent or as quick and sharp as wed like but we kept going and its a great feeling to win it in the last minute
2546458 ramallah west bank ips only six percent of probes into offenses allegedly committed by israeli soldiers and settlers against palestinians in the occupied west bank yield indictments a new report says
2546459 conviction rates of israeli settlers and soldiers involved in violence against palestinians are around six percent of cases opened due to what we consider unprofessional investigations
2546460 in many instances the paperwork is either lost or the police or military personnel involved in the investigations claim they are unable to identify the perpetrator
2546461 whereas this process raises urgent questions regarding the responsibility of the state of israel as occupying power to ensure the health and welfare of the civilian population of gaza
2546462 its nasty but as all true keepers do he got stuck in and hes carrying on but its quite painful
2546463 he did brilliantly it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2546464 timmy handles things really well hes a very level headed bloke
2546465 he makes some difficult things look very easy when the ball wobbles and moves around so i think hes handled himself very well
2546466 its a pressure environment we know that and he knows that and hes desperate to get a score in the second innings
2546467 it might be broken we dont know but in some ways theres not much point in doing much about it now because the games on so its one of those where well assess it at the end of the game

2546502 the district courts decision if upheld would have dangerous repercussions far beyond this single case
2546503 that court opinion holding that the secret and unauthorized copying and forwarding of emails while they pass through an email server is not an illegal interception of those emails threatens to wholly eviscerate federal privacy protections against internet wiretapping and to authorize the government to conduct similar email surveillance without getting a wiretapping order from a judge

2546679 they are learning an economics lesson they will see the benefit of the savings and how much money they walk away with when they fix their shoes
2546680 obamas plan is to raise taxes creating more dependance on foreign oil
2546681 i made it very clear that this election was not about how bad someone else was the election had to be about us what we are willing to do our vision of the future and how we are willing to work toward that future
2546682 east hampton one of the main towns on the eastern end of long island that make up the hamptons is burdened with a deficit that could exceed 12 million and that has become a rich source of irony given the communitys spectacular wealth and its concentration of wall street money management talent the town operates its own airport where learjets and helicopters shuttle the beautiful people to their playgrounds east hampton also spends 100 000 a year for a day care program for working families and 710 000 annually for free ymca membership for all the towns children a theater group for the handicapped gets 30 000 a year and there are nutrition and transportation programs for senior citizens the town replenishes its harbors with clams oysters and scallops and recently bought 100 000 worth of beach rakes to keep the shoreline clean in the fall residents do not have to bag and dispose of their leaves themselves the town lets homeowners rake them to the curb where a giant vacuum truck sucks them up and hauls them away at a cost estimated by mcgintee at 300 000 to 400 000 a year over the years town leaders have been reluctant to raise taxes because that could harm the many working class folks struggling to pay their bills and hurt the politicians on election day too but now they may have to cut services and increase taxes after all

2546685 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2546686 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2546687 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2546688 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2546689 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2546690 we are on each others hands who care both of our worlds unhanded us lie stark
2546691 get your wheelbarrows while theyre hot ladies and gentlemen right over here
2546692 once we get all of them doing that our work here will be done
2546693 a few months after receiving his final payment from eki obama sent a request on state senate letterhead urging illinois officials to provide a 50 000 tourism promotion grant to another blackwell company killerspin
2546694 any implication that sen obama would risk an ethical breach in order to secure a small grant for a pingpong tournament is nuts
2546695 the split decision overturned a previous court ruling and has temporarily denied attempts by tribes and environmental groups to stop arizona snowbowl ski resort from expanding development and making fake snow from treated sewage effluent on the holy mountain
2546696 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2546697 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2546698 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2546699 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2546700 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2546701 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2546702 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2546703 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2546704 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2546705 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2546706 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2546707 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2546708 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2546709 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2546710 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2546711 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2546712 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2546713 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2546714 indigenous peoples have the right to manifest practice develop and teach their spiritual and religious traditions customs and ceremonies the right to maintain protect and have access in privacy to their religious and cultural sites the right to the use and control of their ceremonial objects and the right to the repatriation of their human remains
2546715 freedom and democracy to the darkest corners of the world
2546716 a striking advantage as commander in chief albeit perhaps not surprising given his military background
2546717 seventy two percent of americans even most democrats say hed be a good commander in chief of the military by contrast fewer than half 48 percent say obama would be a good commander in chief
2546718 john mccains life experience has earned him a solid national reputation as someone who can serve as the nations commander in chief with 80 saying he can handle the responsibilities of this important role barack obama
2546719 lags well behind on the same measure but does pass the 50 public confidence threshold
2546720 mccain is rated more highly than obama in just one of 10 categories as a strong and decisive leader
2546721 remains competitive both because of trust in his ability to keep the country safe and questions about obama the sole issue on which mccain clearly is favored is terrorism hes also seen as better able to make decisions on security issues
2546722 whites prefer ing him by 2 to 1 for keeping the country safe
2546723 those who attend church less often tend to favor obama
2546724 white evangelical christians who attend church weekly favor mccain by huge margins

2546728 the war secrets senator john mccain hides former pow fights public access to pow mia files
2546729 mccain stood out because he always showed up for the committee hearings where witnesses were going to talk about specific pieces of evidence he would belittle and berate these witnesses questioning their patriotism and otherwise scoffing at their credibility all of this is in the record in the national archives
2546730 do i insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like that no i dont insisted mccain
2546731 capable on hard edged problems like iraq terrorism and guns
2546732 it is well documented that we have for quite a long time known where the real problem is in the middle east yeh and in fact

2546741 there was never any issue of us owing dues until january 2008 when someone in the local office tried to say we owed it
2546742 we paid within days even though we werent officially notified we paid six months dues but we were told that we had not paid dues and that our membership had lapsed they are trying to take away our membership on technicality
2546743 the uaw constitution in article 45 section 1 specifically states that a shop committee person terminated by the employer and who has a pending grievance remains a member and can run for any open office thats pretty cut and dry
2546744 normally the ieb conducts factual hearings but because of ieb prejudice we are asking that the prb itself hold this one
2546745 the prejudice is demonstrated in two ways a according to a witness statement in the record the local expelled the five on the recommendation of eunice stokes administrative assistant to uaw president ron gettelfinger given in a phone conversation in january when stokes did not know and did not inquire about all the facts and b the ieb ordered the trial last fall to go ahead on the theory that the five lied to members in the strike by saying it was authorized though the charge didnt allege that and every witness on both sides agreed at the trial it wasnt true
2546746 in the winter of 1873 many ho chunk people were removed to the nebraska reservation from wisconsin traveling in cattle cars on trains
2546747 this was a horrific experience for the people as many elders women and children suffered and died
2546748 at a time when scores of companies are freezing pensions for their workers some are quietly converting those pension plans into resources to finance their executives retirement benefit and pay in recent years companies from intel corp to centurytel inc collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank and file pension plans this lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives supplemental benefits and compensation

2546762 lets ignore for the moment that several independent recounts of the very rejected ballots gore sought to have improperly in my opinion counted revealed
2546763 the only way al gore wins a statewide recount in florida and remember he wasnt asking for that is if you count the

2546776 the amendment could be rephrased because a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

2546778 the person having the greatest number of electoral votes shall be the president
2546779 does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause
2546780 it the prefatory clause fits perfectly with his conclusion once one knows the history that the founding generation knew and that we have described above
2546781 it is dubious to rely on such history to interpret a text that was widely understood to codify a pre existing right rather than to fashion a new one

2546784 hey plaisted you used the word thug once so na na na boo boo
2546785 one of the fundamental differences between liberals and conservatives perhaps the most important one politically is what they think or how they feel about the united states conservatives think the u s is a great country liberals think it is a deeply flawed but redeemable country radicals think it is hopelessly bad and should be destroyed or remade
2546786 it will have negative consequences on neighboring countries and instability which most of these countries suffer from already

2546795 as the world celebrates the beijing olympic games i would also like to call upon the organizers of all major sports events in the world to make sure they use public transport facilities build proper waste management systems and use greener forms for energy
2546796 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2546797 for paul the resurrection of jesus of nazareth is the heart of the gospel not to the exclusion of the cross of course but not least as the event which gives the cross its meaning it is the object of faith the ground of justification the basis for obedient christian living the motivation for unity and not least the challenge to the principalities and powers it is the event that declares that there is another king and summons human beings to allegiance and thereby to a different way of life in fulfilment of the jewish scriptures and in expectation of the final new world which began at easter and which will be completed when the night is finally gone and the day has fully dawned
2546798 now i would remind you brothers of the gospel i preached to you which you received in which you stand and by which you are being saved if you hold fast to the word i preached to you unless you believed in vain for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures

2546805 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native

2546830 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2546831 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for last week despite generally weak economic reports

2546874 your arguments about diversity and responsibility and divisiveness are irrelevant to that fundamental issue the actions are protected speech and you have no right in your
2546875 and take steps to repair the universitys image after a troubling freedom of speech episode which has drawn criticism from conservative pundits free speech advocates and florida attorney general bill mccollum
2546876 as educators we must speak up when the debate is inaccurate or when students do not feel safe on campus
2546877 i fully recognize the universitys obligation to preserve campus safety and its interest in encouraging accurate debate
2546878 according to the administrations view of the world elements of radical islam do not want to kill us
2546879 not only is this view wrong but it is itself dangerous
2546880 that is a fact it is documented it is undeniable
2546881 by failing to differentiate between the muslim students on campus whom they sought to protect and the elements of radical islam who pose a real threat the university has breached its responsibility to its students by creating its own atmosphere of inaccuracy
2546882 furthermore true and accurate debate cannot commence at uf while its administration adopts a position that is one of appeasement and denial
2546883 may have violated the free speech rights of the students and organizations who posted this ad and sponsored the movie
2546884 at the very least it has created a chilling effect on the free speech rights of students enrolled at the university of florida
2546885 in light of dr actions today and the universitys inadequate initial response i believe the following actions are appropriate in order to restore confidence in the university of floridas commitment to free speech a public apology by dr telles irvin to the students who were attacked for promoting the film a public reprimand by the university of dr telles irvin a substantive and enunciated policy expressing floridas commitment to free speech and an action plan for how incidents like this can be avoided in the future
2546886 as a proud product of floridas public university system and an elected representative of the state this is not something i take any joy in
2546887 however i believe that remaining silent will only contribute to the erosion of confidence in the universitys ability to promote serious discussions about the important issues facing the students
2546888 the second e mail that went out last week has absolutely not satisfied the attorney general
2546889 in the first response sent to students dr telles irvin called for an apology that particular call was the very act that potentially chilled free speech on the campus and until an official response is made rescinding that call for an apology or acknowledging that it was wrong the attorney general will remain unsatisfied and gravely concerned
2546890 weve had conversations with the attorney generals office and we are still talking
2546891 it is a good test match wicket if you are a batsman you really have to work hard to get going i think it is a very good test match wicket
2546892 first things first we have to get them out as early as possible without letting them get a big lead that is what we are going to look for tomorrow
2546893 first session is crucial tomorrow from there we have to bat really well and put up a good total so that they have to bat last on this track
2546894 we are very hopeful for tomorrow the game is evenly poised now today a few decisions went here and there but we were really giving our best it could have gone either way from there we have to wait and watch how the game shapes up tomorrow

2546900 if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
2546901 if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
2546902 i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night

2546910 i believe that conservatively 15 to 20 of all cancer is caused by infections however the number could be larger maybe double
2546911 unfortunately the public as well as many health care workers are unaware of the significance of chronic infection as a potentially preventable cause of cancer
2546912 why electricity is the only alternative fuel that can lead to energy independence
2546913 the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action it is vital that all nations identify cost effective steps that they can take now to contribute to substantial and long term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions
2546914 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
2546915 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2546916 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2546917 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2546918 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2546971 we are at a fairly early stage of this but there are areas of the iranian economy that are vulnerable to targeted sanctions whether they be in the lng liquefied natural gas sector investment in the oil and gas sector imported refined products reinsurance other financial areas which are areas we would look at if we are looking to increase the pressure on the iranian leadership
2546972 a number of other countries that we would want to involve in those discussions as we go forward
2546973 nioc is from now on obliged to deposit 100 percent of crude oil export income in foreign bank accounts that are chosen by the central bank of iran
2546974 this decision was made after the expansion of new rounds of sanctions against iran so that irans assets are not blocked in foreign banks
2546975 many foreign banks and even some chinese banks have cut their financial operations with iran and these restrictions increase day by day
2546976 chens bronze medal is worth great praise we expect her to continue achieving greatness for the country
2546977 the report is not true as our officials are allowed to go anywhere with their noc cards
2546978 the treatment we received was the same as four years ago there is no problem with that
2546979 at the very beginning my coach told me that my style was probably the worst among the worlds lifters
2546980 i am a woman of strength but so poor in technique
2546981 as for the clean and jerk i have improved so much over the last few years from 70 to 80 kilos
2546982 however i was a little bit stressed and nervous and thats why i did not perform better
2546983 even if i break an arm i will not let go of the barbell
2546984 i have done my best and im sure in the next four years with more intensive training i think i will improve my performance in the clean and jerk
2546985 as for the snatch im very confident because im a young woman of great strength and i am sure i can do it well
2546986 taiwans isolation internationally is a result of chinas oppression ma as the nations leader should find a way to safeguard taiwans international status and highlight the unreasonableness of chinas suppression
2546987 but instead the new government is trying to negotiate with the countrys persecutor and to offer i wont struggle
2546988 ma should find a way to safeguard taiwans international status
2546989 taiwan stands great chances of winning medals as one of the home teams

2546991 fishing methods are becoming more and more advanced so fish stocks are plummeting everywhere
2546992 the key points of the review will include the training of the animals keepers and veterinarians as well as the facilities where the pandas will be kept

2546998 taiwan is a democratic society and we cant shut down those underground radio stations because they hold different thoughts i believe in the wisdom of the taiwanese people to make their own judgments
2546999 i wont bring any flags including the national flag and will not bring banners that are too eye catching either
2547000 chinese laws are unpredictable no one knows what would happen if you were to break the rules of the games
2547001 earlier this year penghu suffered from an ocean freeze that killed massive amounts of fish with shallow sections of the coastal sea this is bound to happen in low temperatures but with well managed fish farms the damage can be better controlled
2547002 fishing methods are becoming more and more advanced so fish stocks are plummeting everywhere seafood proteins are bound to come from fish farms in the future
2547003 during the release of fish fry 11 national ocean university students were among those who participated the county encourages such participation and is trying to work with a number of universities to recruit talent
2547004 can experience the charm of living by the sea and see how local fishermen make their living
2547005 the fish in the ocean will one day be gone if we continue to take out large amounts if we instead teach our tourists how to fish let them bring in their catch and teach our guests how to cook them the economical value of a catch increases while the amount of catches will decrease
2547006 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2547007 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly

2547009 violent video games have been a problem for a long time

2547011 uh actually im at 313 my clothes must be throwing your scale off a bit

2547026 the lee myung bak group had better face up to the serious situation and behave with discretion
2547027 i was disappointed as south and north korea couldnt march together
2547028 i believe what is more important in south north korean ties is practical improvement in their relations the easiest way to achieve that is through sports
2547029 hes going saturday to meet the leaders of the political parties involved in the sadc mandated talks facilitated by south africa
2547030 zanu pf has been put into a corner by domestic and international pressure and that corner is shrinking
2547031 a settlement will be reached but what remains to be seen is whether the agreement can be implemented
2547032 a deal making robert mugabe a ceremonial president and morgan tsvangirai a prime minister is probably the one and only way forward now in zimbabwe
2547033 it will not be realistic or feasible for now to leave mugabe out completely from the political scene
2547034 we cant keep going back at it with pakistan cmon man where would that leave us
2547035 weve done war were in a different place now its not about india pakistan
2547036 its about india what can we do as a country what can we achieve
2547037 what do i care for pakistan we should all leave each other alone
2547038 danger is everywhere but i have to live my life
2547039 as long the turkish state insists on this war such actions will justifiably be expanded
2547040 we believe these actions carried out against turkeys economic resources have a deterring effect on its war to destroy the kurdish people
2547041 we are expecting the fire to last for one or two days
2547042 the fire will burn under the control of firefighters and a technical team
2547043 once the three men were in the water there was very little chance they could get back on the boat
2547044 it would be beyond their reach in seconds from that point the end would have been swift
2547045 none of them was a good swimmer the seas were choppy they would have quickly become exhausted and sunk beneath the waves although i cant exclude the possibility of a shark attacking them drowning is a far more likely cause of death
2547046 my biggest fear was being attacked by somebody who did not want me on the boat i was 160km out to sea with no back up
2547047 we also demand that the united nations and international society do not ignore the nuclear weapons of north korea pakistan and israel as well as the suspicions of nuclear development by iran but take stern measures against these countries
2547048 india whose nuclear cooperation with the us is a concern should be strongly urged to join the npt and ctbt
2547049 the bottom line for us is this is the way to get the cooperation we want this is the way to get the support for nonproliferation
2547050 the need to demonstrate our sovereignty in the arctic has never been more important which is why our government has made this research a top priority
2547051 our commitment to this initiative as well as other investments in the north is ultimately about turning potential into prosperity for this remarkable region and for our country as a whole
2547052 this joint research is another step supporting canadas submission in relation to the extended polar continental shelf in the high arctic
2547053 there will be a battle between canadian and danish scientists on one side and the russians on the other
2547054 has done nothing except hide behind vague assurances that omar is being treated humanely assurances the canadian government has known for years to be absolutely false
2547055 it is time for prime minister harper to stand up for the rights of a canadian citizen
2547056 its another attempt by mr khadrs lawyers to avoid trial on the charges of murder in violation of the laws of the war attempted murder in violation of the laws of the war conspiracy providing material support for terrorism and spying
2547057 now we know that the canadian government has known about facilitated and helped cover up the torture and abuse of a canadian citizen
2547058 this is no longer just a matter of government policy
2547059 i think this is the last hurdle that we had and its now cleared
2547060 of course it means a real opportunity for the people of the area to have access to the peace dividend
2547061 thank god they have agreed at last to have an administration for the abyei area so we welcome it better late than never
2547062 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2547063 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2547064 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2547065 it was in a container in my safe and it hadnt been touched
2547066 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2547067 anyone who voted for me or caucused for me has so much more in common with senator obama than senator mccain
2547068 we may have started on two separate paths but we are on one journey now
2547069 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance
2547070 we talked to melba santana the wife of fellow prisoner alfredo dominguez batista she visited the prison and she was unable to see herrera but apparently the journalist herrera was able to smuggle her a note telling his condition
2547071 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2547072 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2547073 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2547074 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2547075 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2547081 time is running out to stop the climate change tipping point
2547082 no one sympathizes with taitung but i am willing to step up and fight for taitungs future
2547083 im not sporty and came here out of patriotism because i heard we might see the first gold medal for china
2547084 on every lift i trembled as if i was carrying that weight myself
2547085 but i was very moved indeed it was me fighting back the tears not her winning the first gold medal is a very good thing for weightlifting and a great thing for our country i am very excited it was awesome and it will also give china a boost for the rest of the games
2547086 everyone in china was expecting so much from her too much pressure she must be feeling so low now
2547087 she is such a little person and she lifted so much weight and did it perfectly every time i am such a big fan she has lifted china
2547088 he was larger than life a father figure to so many and one of the last legends in the entertainment business
2547089 he believed in what youre doing and helped give you confidence but he also was really smart about show business even the most fundamental stuff
2547090 even though what i was doing on saturday night live was more rock n roll and different generation and different sensitivity
2547091 at the core he knew about audience and talent and how to put on a show he loved show business and he was unabashed in how much he loved it
2547092 he was from manhattan and the nightclub business and a show business that i had sort of seen in the movies
2547093 and he was captivating and always funny really funny and direct in a kind of language i had never heard before he was much more disrespectful than canadians were allowed to be in 1968
2547094 where did i go right youre no one in hollywood unless someone wants you dead
2547095 and ended up making six lousy movies two good movies and one great movie
2547096 bernie was an icon and one of the most successful talent managers in the business
2547097 he was a father to me and he was my mentor and my partner and the godfather of my eldest son and im going to miss him every day for the rest of my life
2547098 truly loved show business which is extraordinary in this day and age
2547099 he knew the history of show business his instincts for talent were extraordinary and he knew people and so not only was he very talented he was brilliantly funny and he was fiercely loyal and obviously he will be missed by our community and everyone that knew him
2547100 he worked with me every day until i left to become chairman of paramount in 2005
2547101 inf r kommande s songs satsning har viradat upp ett yantal tg rder f rm att uppn de m l viw satt upp

2547103 social kissing has been common in certain circles in britain since the 1920s but until fairly recently it was mostly confined to relatives or close friends and to what you might call the excitable professions the theater the media fashion anywhere you might call someone darling basically its now infinitely more widespread even accountants do it
2547104 were now starting to see the advent of non sexual lip kissing
2547105 bank manager and customer boss and employee next door neighbors client and accountant any old colleague theyre all greeting each other with a little scuffle round the cheek and lip area the rule seems to be if youve met them even once you kiss them and in business circles certainly that very definitely wasnt the case even three years ago
2547106 we kiss people we used to hug hug people we used to shake hands with and shake hands with people we used to nod to
2547107 its like these days its not unusual to hear teenagers say to their parents i love you in my day if youd said that to your mum or dad theyd have assumed they were about to be given the last rites and were becoming much more tactile theres a whole revolution in that
2547108 its about fast track bonding and empathy it also allows you to smell the other person your nose is right by the pulse behind their ear you can sniff their perfume and have a fairly good guess at what they had for lunch its a far more intimate personal instant connection
2547109 when parents kiss their children it means one thing but when they kiss each other it means something entirely different people will greet a total stranger with a kiss on the cheek and then use an identical gesture to express their most intimate feelings to a lover
2547110 kisses can be given in private or in public by men to men men to women women to women adults to children or children to each other
2547111 they can be unilateral or reciprocated they can be on the lips the cheek or any other part of the body they can be blown in the air
2547112 giving a mutual kiss when they depart from each other a custom that i never saw before nor heard of nor read in any history
2547113 i grew up at a time when if even your mother kissed you you were expected to wipe your mouth on your sleeve for decades a firm handshake was all that was expected now youre expected to embrace your female colleagues daily even perhaps hug the divisional director from manchester its all become incredibly awkward and embarrassing
2547114 i feel permanently uncomfortable these days most of my friends expect a kiss which is fine i suppose quite nice in fact but at what point do you decide whether a colleague or a regular business contact or client or even a friends partner is also a friend theres a real risk of getting it wrong of offending someone whatever you decide to do i get quite nervous
2547115 the british werent even very good at the handshake and now we find ourselves having to deal with air kisses cheek kisses hugs squeezes even lip kisses its not easy the basic rule i think should be that handshakes are fine with anyone and kisses should be reserved for people you have some kind of relationship with even if its only a business lunch at which youve talked about something other than just business
2547116 really go for broke and you have to give advance warning of your intentions make what we call announcement gestures start puckering early on and raise your hands from quite a distance never kiss anyone without a torso touch by the way then theres a good chance theyll be prepared for whats coming then its basically right cheek to right cheek left cheek to left cheek and put them down where you found them
2547117 its only really man to man where theres still some reticence
2547118 many men particularly younger generations will embrace quite comfortably these days but they still kind of feel the need to accompany it with some big sopranos style slap on the back to show that even though they kiss theyre still men
2547119 if you kiss at one meeting and not at the next theyre going to get entirely the wrong message
2547120 take it on the chin when you get it wrong because believe me you will
2547121 if you dont want smoke in your eyes dont buy a firepit
2547122 it felt like i was back on my home court like i was competing in taiwan
2547123 but i wasnt really thinking about it i was just trying to be serious and play each game well
2547124 while we dont comment on specifics for competitive reasons over the last year we have initiated a number of partner programs focused on new business co marketing vertical markets and solutions
2547125 we believe these investments will generate more growth opportunities for all hp partners
2547126 depending on the extent of the deal and whether hp really pours a lot into it it may also indicate hp feels it isnt getting enough from its existing partners as far as smb goes which has actually been an issue theyve been working on for a while
2547127 i think the hinge will be how much of a solution seller cdw can become for hp
2547128 i think we proved today to all the naysayers that were still medal contenders
2547129 this is an incredible accomplishment for jon to make the individual event finals on high bar at the olympic games
2547130 he picked a great time to put it all together hes going to have a busy and exciting week with the team finals all around finals and the high bar finals ahead
2547131 i have to persuade them and work hard to overcome this mentality and be prepared for tough matches but it seems that i fought here alone its an issue of attitude
2547132 the start time is not only early for us but for italy too there is a different mentality with russian teams regarding early matches as they tend to have an issue with fatigue
2547133 i have to persuade them and work hard to overcome this mentality and be prepared for tough matches but it seems that i fought here alone its an issue of attitude
2547134 there was also a lack of concentration from the players italy took advantage of this in the third and fourth sets
2547135 im very proud of my players we play a good match with a good rhythm
2547136 our girls were challenged by the fact we have never played belarus
2547137 for us it was a significant game and i think our recent loss in the diamond ball against the usa helped prepare us for today
2547138 were just chipping away at a number of things weve got quite a few things to work on but i thought we executed pretty well
2547139 we have so much more to give our chances are extremely high at these olympics weve come here to take home gold
2547140 for naked physical talent theyre clearly the best team theyre quicker stronger and they run great
2547141 there will be no pressure when playing the usa theyre the only team that has something to lose
2547142 he has no big weaknesses i think he will win anyone can be beaten but i think he is the best boxer in this category
2547143 i already knew what he was going to bring but i kept my composure
2547144 s nachts is de straat bezaaid met bezopen lui echt een hylarisch gezicht maar het is wat minder vrolijk dan de lallende overhemddragers in groningen
2547145 it is absolutely amazing we made history today i am proud of myself as well as sada and becca
2547146 it is really a dream come true but i am glad its over
2547147 the floor is a bit too hard and i didnt feel comfortable it is definitely a distraction
2547148 failed to adjust my strategy according to my opponents moves
2547149 i love cobens books but this one seemed some how forced with far too many coincidences and the plot lines being forced together going to keep reading his stuff as it comes out though
2547150 certainly not my normal sort of thing and i did not read it in public
2547151 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
2547152 the development of a handset offering menus and a dictionary for predictive text as gaeilge is long overdue however such a product should be available to all of the people of this country and not merely on one side of the british created border
2547153 annie has managed to fill every cupboard and cabinets to capacity with stupid stuff
2547154 after i die she will be known as the crazy cat lady
2547155 i cry for help but you do not listen i cry out to you but you do not intervene why do you let me see ruin why must i look at misery
2547156 how long o lord i cry for help but you do not listen
2547157 the lord answered habakkuk and said for the vision still has its appointed time presses on to fulfillment and will not disappoint if it delays wait for it it will surely come it will not be late but the just one because of his faith shall live
2547158 any star is enough if you know what star it is
2547159 our fans are already known to be courteous and respectful and our student athletes and staff know they provide a great atmosphere which makes playing the beavs tough beavhavior counts is just a simple way for us to remind ourselves that winning is important and doing it with class matters as well
2547160 when you see him out there for a freshman you dont get any more of a chiseled well defined athlete than this guy
2547161 for a guy so young he shows very good leadership skills
2547162 the players seem to gravitate to him we always talk about that special something well the players like being around this guy and that usually bodes well for what is going to happen down the line
2547163 but hes also running against the third offensive line now all of a sudden when you take a guy like ethan johnson and put him against the first offensive line you find out if you see a lot of the same things you saw friday yesterday he was in the backfield the whole day
2547164 when we first started recruiting him as a junior in high school he was about 215
2547165 steve filer was 205 210 when we first got involved hes 235 theres a big difference between a linebacker who is 235 and one that is 210
2547166 there were a bunch of them that stood out to us
2547167 the problem i have is that some of these guys were running down the line on the depth chart so a lot of them were threes against threes
2547168 it will be interesting this week when we start mixing and mingling for the next week or so the depth chart is going to change a whole bunch because there might be a guy
2547169 luke schmidt has had a lot of bad luck since hes been here
2547170 every time hes ready to get in the mix something has happened medically where he has gotten banged up
2547171 were talking about mike ragone will yeatman and the two freshmen but were forgetting about a guy like that who realistically has as much athletic ability as all the rest of them
2547172 this whole project just pulled together in july you had to question whether everything was going to be ready to go they did a really nice job
2547173 we tried to do our best to rotate among the three fields to try to prevent from tearing them up
2547174 but there have been so many times where if in doubt wed stay inside just to save the fields from being ripped up
2547175 i cant believe how amazing this whole experience has been
2547176 it is absolutely a dream come true to be here and that it is exactly what i imagined it to be and more
2547177 devtrac have newer models of the same thing or slightly better i mean how long have you had this
2547178 oh twelve or so years yes at least that i reckon
2547179 we can go first thing tomorrow maybe before the rain
2547180 okay but they say the rain will be here by nine
2547181 yup contractors favourite dont have to hang around waiting for the weather there made in australia
2547182 australia australia why thats weird theyve had the worst drought possible for the last ten years or so
2547183 how much john can i do a dance spin sing a song customer of yours since you started whats the deal
2547184 give us a moment to wrestle with our consciences john
2547185 yes dead right she has but wouldnt that be a frock or some such frivolity a lawnmower
2547186 well if i didnt know you better paula id say youre a bit sad
2547187 the answer of a great man to one who asked what time was
2547188 there is another sort of distance or length the idea whereof we get not from the permanent parts of space but from the fleeting and perpetually perishing parts of succession this we call duration
2547189 train of ideas which constantly succeed one another in our understanding
2547190 for whilst we are thinking or whilst we receive successively several ideas in our minds we know that we do exist and so we call the existence or the continuation of the existence of ourselves or anything else commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds the duration of ourselves or any such other thing co existing with our thinking
2547191 our ancestors who formerly maintained these places loved wisdom and through it they obtained wealth and passed it on to us

2547195 he thinks you do your job and what will be will be i think that what i do and what you do matters he sleeps better at night he shouldnt
2547196 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2547197 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2547198 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2547199 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2547200 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2547201 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
2547202 timmy has damaged a finger which is quite nasty actually but as all true keepers do he got stuck in and hes carrying on but its quite painful
2547203 it might be broken we dont know but in some ways theres not much point in doing much about it now because the games on so its one of those where well assess it at the end of the game
2547204 hes happy to carry on the doctors seen it and doesnt think he has done any structural damage so hell carry on with painkillers and well sort it out afterwards
2547205 he did brilliantly because it was definitely no more than a half or a third chance
2547206 he got a hand on it but if you watch the footage back hes got an awfully long way to get there
2547207 inside edges are especially difficult for keepers because youre setting yourself for the outside edge all the time
2547208 id give him credit for getting a hand to it actually i wouldnt have got anywhere near it dont worry about that
2547209 timmy handles things really well hes a very level headed bloke
2547210 whether hes done well by getting a hundred at wellington or had tougher times he stays very much at an even keel which is very much a strength of his
2547211 he makes some difficult things look very easy when the ball wobbles and moves around so i think hes handled himself very well
2547212 its a pressure environment we know that and he knows that and hes desperate to get a score in the second innings
2547213 the mayor also flew to tallahassee on a court approved trip then drove back to detroit making stops in atlanta to visit the king center also court approved chattanooga and cincinnati
2547214 another trip occurred to chicago and was again court approved on the way back he stopped in indiana each time the mayor opted to drive back sometimes to enjoy the company of family members but other times because he simply enjoys the solitude of driving each trip was court approved within the court approved timeframe albeit through different jurisdictions and was the most direct route back to detroit
2547215 there was a like a shadow over all of us
2547216 he was going to go in a van with the son but he wanted to go with his friends on the bus

2547233 taiwanese investment in bangladesh is increasing rapidly trade is also growing faster with them but still there are some bottlenecks to be removed
2547234 we want business both with taiwan and china i think diplomacy should not hinder business activities between the countries
2547235 bangladesh values its relationship with china very much but this relationship should not hamper the countrys business with others
2547236 bangladesh should show courage skill and prudence in diplomatic and trade talks with its partners

2547238 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2547239 i dont think the bombing is coming from tbilisi but whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
2547240 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2547241 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo of aug 6

2547245 walked into the path of the motor vehicle at which point the officer locked up the brakes and the vehicle stopped abruptly brushing the baby carriage
2547246 its a misrepresentation to say the officer brushed the stroller

2547249 the regulations on the employment of indigenous people are at final stages

2547298 thanks dragon naturallyspeaking for allowing me to do so much even though i refused to learn how to type
2547299 i use dragon naturallyspeaking to regain control of the life that was temporarily robbed from me and to bring that same sense of empowerment to other soldiers just like me
2547300 the use of dragon naturallyspeaking to use a computer to connect to do something that i was able to do before i was injured made me feel somewhat whole somewhat normal for the first time it has been my distinct pleasure and honor to give that feeling a feeling of ability to our wounded dragon has not only improved my life it has changed my life
2547301 it takes me about one tenth of the time to generate an extremely clean accurate report it is virtually like dictating my field notes and checklist items to a stenographer
2547302 dragon has saved me untold hours of typing thousands of important details into a fine finished product i can almost always generate a polished report that can be emailed out in less than 24 hours from the end of the actual inspection for that our customers are very happy and impressed

2547309 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2547310 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2547311 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen

2547313 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others

2547316 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2547317 there is some talent out there now its a matter of getting it together getting it together you have got to stay healthy when you look at that team out there you see a pretty good looking team then you realize that about seven or eight arent going to play for three games we are going to have to call on these young people more than we have ever i guess
2547318 it means that we work them more because some of them are going to have to play usually those freshmen you would like to bring them slow and if they are not ready go ahead and redshirt them there are some that are going to have to play anyway to get through those first three ball games
2547319 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb the georgian leader told the us television network
2547320 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2547321 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2547322 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country

2547329 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2547330 i think they need to work through that process of healing

2547376 the team did not come up with a concrete proposal they kept repeating what happened in the meeting in new delhi we reiterated our demands the meeting was inconclusive
2547377 we must see how to reduce the difficulties in jammu and kashmir and as such we handle the situation with persuasion and goodwill
2547378 there is no report of any untoward incident so far from any curfew bound area the situation is peaceful
2547379 rioters hired from outside the state are perpetrating violence and oppression on the muslims of jammu under a deep conspiracy while communal leader dinesh bharti is openly spewing venom against muslims
2547380 this situation has arisen because of the criminal negligence of the government in new delhi and the events of 1947 are being repeated
2547381 on the same day people from muzaffarabad will head for srinagar with essential supplies and life saving drugs
2547382 people from poonch and other muslim dominated areas of jammu will also march for rawalakot
2547383 let me make it clear to sass leaders they should not try to browbeat the kashmiri politicians as such idiotic actions could cause more harm to the people of jammu than any other region
2547384 i am sure even certain quarters in the police and other security agencies are aware of the presence of such non state subject trouble mongers in jammu

2547485 russian president dmitry medvedev told bush the only solution was for georgian troops to quit the conflict zone
2547486 as georgian troops began their anti terrorist operation in the pankissy valley last week an alleged russian air strike against a village in the valley made georgian russian uneasy relations dangerously hostile
2547487 the caucasus republic of georgia as nations go is not apparently a major global player yet washington has invested huge sums and organized to put its own despot mikhail saakashvili in the presidency in order to close a nuclear north atlantic treaty organization nato iron ring around russia
2547488 us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited the capital tbilisi and made sharp statements against moscow for supporting the separatist georgian states of abkhazia and south ossetia in essence blaming moscow for an imminent war washington has incited in order to bring georgia into nato by the december nato summit
2547489 the underlying issue is the fact that since the dissolution of the warsaw pact in 1991 one after the other former members as well as former states of the ussr have been coaxed and in many cases bribed with false promises by washington into joining the counter organization nato
2547490 although the united states has trained several crack georgian units in the past few years the fighting effectiveness of all other elements is uncertain there are no trained sergeants and troop morale is running low only about 50 of the military equipment is operational and coordinated operations in adverse conditions are impossible
2547491 however georgia under washingtons man strongman president mikhail saakashvili a pretty ruthless dictator as he recently showed against domestic opposition refuses to back off its provocative nato bid
2547492 georgia is also a strategic transit country for the anglo american caspian oil pipeline from baku in azerbaijan through georgia to the turkish port of ceyhan
2547493 as the moscow times sees it one way to disrupt georgias nato aspirations would be to heat up the conflict in abkhazia to a level that would make it unacceptable for the western alliance which acts by the consensus of all members to offer membership georgias leadership could be escalating tensions in hope of prompting abkhazia and russia to make a move that would leave the west with no chance but to intervene
2547494 last week the gloves finally came off the dmitry medvedev presidency in russia
2547495 bush characterized him patronizingly as a sharp guy soon after they met in hokkaido on july 9 but that was after making sure secretary of state condoleezza rice proceeded to prague and signed a deal just the previous day to install a us radar system as part of its missile defense system in central europe
2547496 if medvedevs core mission in hokkaido was to underscore russias growing role in the world arena as a power with which the west has to contend bush acted as if he couldnt care
2547497 while in tbilisi she called for international mediation to stop violence spilling over in georgias beakaway regions of south ossetia and abhkazia which have been sources of rising tensions with georgia accusing russia of trying to annex the regions to carry matters further the us began a joint military exercise with georgia codenamed immediate response 2008 near tbilisi which will continue through the month of july

2547516 en una jornada que a buen seguro va a ser inolvidable y va a constituir el punto de inicio de muchas buenas relaciones de amistad para el futuro
2547517 lo normal es que la mayor parte de las personas tengan nombres m s comunes y conozcan a otros semejantes con su mismo nombre algo a lo que casi no dan importancia porque entra dentro de lo habitual pero para los que no hemos tenido esta oportunidad se trata de algo muy especial porque nosotros por nuestro nombre tambi n somos especiales

2547528 cese inmediato de la agresi n contra osetia del sur
2547529 un intento de involucrar a otros pa ses y pueblos en sus sanguinarias aventuras
2547530 creo que esto es ahora obvio tanto en georgia y rusia como en el resto del mundo
2547531 las acciones de las autoridades georgianas en osetia del sur son por supuesto un crimen y ante todo un crimen contra su propio pueblo

2547551 tony was never violent with me and i dont believe he ever would be
2547552 we would argue every now and again but it was never to the point of being aggressive or angry nothing like that no
2547553 this whole thing has blown me away but i guess in a way it has given me a chance to set the record straight and talk about what sort of person tony really is
2547554 i was very much like im glad you and tony are together i know that tony and i have our own history but we have a strong friendship so i dont need to know you to have tony in my life if tony and i want to be in each others lives we will choose to be
2547555 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

2547559 a major increase in innovative activity in china the republic of korea and the united states has driven the overall growth of patent filings in 2006 this reflects a consolidation of earlier trends which demonstrate a marked shift in innovation hubs around the world
2547560 while use of the patent system remains highly concentrated among a group of countries statistics show an increasing level of patent activity in emerging countries this is an encouraging trend
2547561 evolution and use of the patent system is critical to understanding policy debates including the role of intellectual property in economic growth and development the relationship between ip policy and other key public policy issues such as health and the environment and to initiatives to improve the efficiency of the patent system itself
2547562 the report which is part of wipos on going commitment to improve statistical information on patent activity allows users to analyze and monitor the latest trends in patent activity based on objective and detailed information
2547563 emerging countries such as india brazil and turkey are increasingly using the system to file international applications
2547564 while the report underlines promising trends in the use of the patent system it also points to the need to find solutions to address the persistent backlogs in workload at many ip offices around the world

2547576 the figures show that organizations havent nailed down the e mail channel
2547577 e mail protection is catching on as a technology that manages information as the industry moves away from protect and defense to becoming more aware how information flows around the organization
2547578 these figures do not surprise me on the whole employees are not sending stuff out maliciously but through carelessness or lack of forethought
2547579 education can help to some extent but many employees are using communications tools all day every day and mistakes will happen so having checks in place makes sense affordability of available technology to tackle the problem is also a problem as most businesses are unable to invest in the high end on premise data leak prevention dlp products that large business can
2547580 it is not that they have not wanted to clamp down on leaks
2547581 they have been aware for some time but it is more the fact that there wasnt the technology to do so e mail protection is a consolidation of several technologies
2547582 people have been wanting it and now vendors are selling solutions most of which are data leak protection products focused on leaks and not the environment in which leaks occur
2547583 there are a lot of integration issues to consider namely integration with encryption policies different classification of data etc
2547584 a data leak solution needs to fit into wider risk management solution
2547585 they should look at what they are trying to protect how long they need to protect their data for who uses that data etc
2547586 the security industry is oriented around keeping customers in a constant state of fear
2547587 we need to change attitudes from perimeters and technology focused to information focused
2547588 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2547589 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2547590 caro silvio ti abbiamo votato ora dimostra che cosa sai fare
2547591 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
2547592 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
2547593 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
2547594 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
2547595 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
2547596 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
2547597 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
2547598 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
2547599 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
2547600 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
2547601 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
2547602 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
2547603 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
2547604 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
2547605 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him

2547608 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
2547609 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
2547610 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
2547611 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
2547612 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
2547613 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

2547625 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2547626 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977

2547628 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about

2547632 la musica nata nella chiesa sia un rendere udibile e percepibile la verit della nostra fede dal gregoriano alla musica delle cattedrali fino a palestrina e alla sua epoca fino a bach e quindi a mozart e bruckner e cos via ascoltando tutte queste opere le passioni di bach la sua messa in si bemolle e le grandi composizioni spirituali della polifonia del xvi secolo della scuola viennese di tutta la musica anche quella dei maestri minori improvvisamente sentiamo vero dove nascono cose del genere c la verit senza unintuizione che scopra il vero centro creativo del mondo non pu nascere tale bellezza
2547633 dio ha ucciso mozart perch non fosse intaccato da nemmeno un barlume di mediocrit e ha costretto me ad assistere al mio disfacimento

2547639 there is no reason why stepfathers cannot make incredibly good parents and they may be more attentive

2547646 this article is not about sid williams or about what de means or about philosophy but it is really about responsibility ethics professionalism image and credibility

2547660 the dollar rose this week on the belief the global economic slowdown will depress oil consumption and on slowing growth in europe and in the united kingdom which could lead to interest rate cuts by the ecb and bank of england
2547661 if interest rate cuts are ahead in europe that reduces the attractiveness of the euro and cause investors to reduce positions in the euro which is what we saw happen this week
2547662 that will increase the attractiveness of dollar denominated investments and the dollar will continue to rise
2547663 there have been too many dollar head fakes in this market technically we need to see the euro stay below 1 50 for three straight days and fundamentally we need to see some positive data points for the u s economy including an improvement in gdp growth and the trade deficit
2547664 if and when that occurs then ill be bullish on the dollar
2547665 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2547666 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2547667 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2547668 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too
2547669 you should convince millions of chinese and indians who are willing to live an american way of life that they dont have to buy cars they dont need a fridge

2547677 i have never enjoyed reading the bible as much as i did with that
2547678 i can see the images and understand the story better
2547679 one thing i found as a visual learner some of what i was reading was much easier to remember because of the format
2547680 its for people who know the bible but could benefit from a creative interpretation
2547681 it is also for those who dont know the bible stories it introduces them to the grand biblical narrative
2547682 if we are not addressing issues contemporaneously we should all just go home and hope for the best
2547683 on the other hand the authors of the bible were always ingeniously contemporary
2547684 did jesus dumb down the entire book of deuteronomy by his condensation of the law into a phrase
2547685 theres a lot of blood and guts and scorched earth
2547686 but as familiar as i am with jesus and his stories and teachings i never really had a grasp of the personality i never had any insight on the emotional aspect of jesus
2547687 if we want to reinvigorate people with the bible especially young people i think this is a wonderful way to do it

2547923 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2547924 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2547925 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2547926 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2547927 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2547928 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2547929 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2547930 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2547931 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2547932 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2547933 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2547934 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2547935 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2547936 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2547937 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2547938 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2547939 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2547940 continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility high quality is the key to high speed the way to go fast is to keep the software as clean and robust as possible thus all agile team members are committed to producing only the highest quality code they can they do not make messes and then tell themselves that theyll clean up when they have more time they clean any messes as they are made
2547941 the goal of refactoring as depicted in this chapter is to clean your code every day every hour and every minute we dont want the mess to build we dont want to have to chisel and scrub the encrusted bits that accumulate over time we want to be able to extend and modify our systems with a minimum of effort the most important enabler of that ability is the cleanliness of code
2547942 specifying contracts in unit tests contracts can also be specified by writing unit tests by thoroughly testing the behavior of a class the unit tests make the behavior of the class clear authors of client code will want to review the unit tests in order to know what to reasonably assume about the classes they are using
2547943 databases are implementation details consideration of the database should be deferred as long as possible far too many applications were designed with the database in mind from the beginning and so are inextricably tied to those databases remember the definition of abstraction
2547944 the amplification of the essential and the elimination of the irrelevant
2547945 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2547946 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2547947 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2547948 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2547949 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2547950 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2547951 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2547952 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2547953 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2547954 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2547955 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2547956 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2547957 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2547958 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2547959 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2547960 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2547961 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2547962 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2547963 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2547964 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2547965 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2547966 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2547967 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2547968 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2547969 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2547970 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2547971 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2547972 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2547973 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2547974 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2547975 ni aquellos xitos que interpretara al lado de la recordada
2547976 aunque esta vez est n a cargo de una voz diferente
2547977 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2547978 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2547979 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2547980 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2547981 rap or die takes you inside the the shady but extremely profitable world of underground hip hop
2547982 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2547983 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2547984 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it
2547985 fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want
2547986 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked and i guarantee you its going to happen again i promise you
2547987 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2547988 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2547989 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2547990 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2547991 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2547992 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2547993 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2547994 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2547995 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife
2547996 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2547997 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2547998 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2547999 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2548000 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2548001 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2548002 earlier farmers havested one crop now since i got the pawan chakki two months ago i hope to harvest for three per season
2548003 salt farmers in gujarat spend rs 75 000 on diesel expenses to pull water this is a big social hurdle for them this windmill is perfect it comes without any recurring cost and cuts down on expenditure
2548004 in the next six months 100 mills in the region will have the windmill we are targeting 250 mills in gujarat
2548005 the beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves and not to twist them with our own image otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them

2548008 that was the first good set in four months i was moving well and not thinking of every shot
2548009 i was flowing and that was a good feeling ill look back to it as a turning point
2548010 it is ending up being the right thing for my tennis
2548011 ill get in two events la and washington which i needed
2548012 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2548013 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2548014 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2548015 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2548016 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2548017 it was the largest rain dispersal operation in china and the first time that such technology has been used to ensure the weather conditions for the olympic opening

2548034 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed
2548035 we fired a total of 1 104 rain dispersal rockets from 21 sites in the city between 4 p m and 11 39 p m on friday which successfully intercepted a stretch of rain belt from moving towards the stadium
2548036 theyre sweating like hell in this 90 degree heat and 90 percent humidity which they have to deal with at the moment
2548037 but to tell you the truth we really dont ride at all in beijing in the summer its like committing suicide seriously the pollution is so bad
2548038 theres no need for them to be wearing those masks its no use
2548039 i believe anywhere within 150 to 200 kilometers of beijing generally isnt suitable for sports
2548040 the training sessions were much worse here in the hills it is much better than in the city
2548041 it was like a burning impression in the lungs and the eyes
2548042 do you think 240 kilometers is good for your health
2548043 i guess its better than i expected because i didnt really feel anything
2548044 it was a lot cooler up in the hills too
2548045 i mean its humid but i didnt die or anything
2548046 i didnt have any problems with my lungs or anything
2548047 i heard from the beginning that many riders were complaining that their eyes hurt and that their lungs hurt but not for me
2548048 i think you definitely felt it in the lungs it must be a negative effect
2548049 obviously coming from a capetown in winter is a bit of a disadvantage
2548050 it was good to get a win after a difficult week we worked hard falkirk played well and made it difficult for us
2548051 es ist eine beleidigung unseres glaubens die scharia hier in diesem forum zu diskutieren
2548052 boss ive got a problem i hit a pig on the road and hes stuck in the bull bars of my truck hes still wriggling what should i do
2548053 in the back of your truck theres a shotgun shoot the pig in the head and when it stops wriggling you can pull it out and throw it in a bush
2548054 boss i did what you said i shot the pig and dragged it out and threw it in a bush
2548055 if youre a dog and your owner wants to feed you a vegetarian diet you will need to have supplements
2548056 australians concerned their privacy is being invaded by googles street view application can have their houses removed after it was revealed hollywood stars homes and entire streets have been deleted it takes only a few clicks of the button and you can request your home be wiped from googles street view
2548057 if you leave we wont be here when you get back well pack and leave
2548058 no we left but were going home because i cant leave the dog alone like you can
2548059 but after seeing the first two heats i kind of wanted to be the top seed going into tomorrow and thats all i went out and did
2548060 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2548061 that was my best morning uhh prelim swim so im happy with it
2548062 but im sure going give him a run for his money
2548063 im going to have a double shot of espresso tomorrow morning
2548064 i think thats the first time hes worn a jammer in two years
2548065 i hope to talk him into something that will cover more of his body
2548066 i dont want to be the center of attention going into the final
2548067 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2548068 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2548069 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2548070 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2548071 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2548072 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2548073 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2548074 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2548075 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2548076 because it is something and if everybody does something then great things will happen
2548077 step up and do the right thing for their investors
2548078 this was not a mutual mistake by financial services companies this was a deliberate effort to ensnare consumers with great damage
2548079 investors have been locked in a nightmare with these securities
2548080 our research reflected the honest belief that auction rate securities offered higher returns in exchange for less liquidity and noted that market changes had begun to occur
2548081 it was the largest rain dispersal operation in china and the first time that such technology has been used to ensure the weather conditions for the olympic opening
2548082 that was the first good set in four months i was moving well and not thinking of every shot
2548083 i was flowing and that was a good feeling ill look back to it as a turning point
2548084 it is ending up being the right thing for my tennis
2548085 ill get in two events la and washington which i needed
2548086 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2548087 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2548088 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2548089 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2548090 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2548091 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2548092 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2548093 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2548094 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2548095 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2548096 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2548097 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2548098 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2548099 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2548100 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2548101 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2548102 it seems like a senseless act of violence by a random individual with no motive
2548103 well be reminding of that when we have our team meeting tonight
2548104 when i first heard about i just thought it was misinformation
2548105 i thought it was just a bad joke its freakish news and its brutal it makes me think twice about going downtown
2548106 theres all this security around how could that happen its definitely makes athletes more nervous i wanted to go to the silk market the great wall the ming tombs now i dont know if im going to do that
2548107 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2548108 it really is a shock that is definitely him this is quite heavy
2548109 he has no memory of being from germany or of having a german brother
2548110 he tells me hes clark rockefeller i believe him i havent been shown any hard evidence that hes something other than what he tells me he is
2548111 he tells me he still doesnt remember about the past he remembers bits and pieces silly sorts of things
2548112 he doesnt remember murdering anybody and he doesnt remember being a tenant of the couple that were murdered
2548113 we are now checking if he could be the german citizen christian karl gerhartsreiter
2548114 if there will be a serious decision to end the occupation of iraq those cells will vanish
2548115 there will be no reason to let those cells stay and work
2548116 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to help the iraqi people
2548117 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2548118 the death toll is likely to increase because heavy rain is still falling and the rivers in the area are rising
2548119 the water and walls of mud came at night when everybody was sleeping

2548125 the original purpose of the temple pilgrimage was that you went to the temple to see the face of the lord
2548126 so we know that somebody thought it was you are seeing the face of the lord yea very interesting very interesting so someone has been at work changing the docs and we know which way
2548127 i think melchizedek was a theophany of yahweh the jewish interpretation certainly the next passage yahweh is the great high priest and he is the one as you have in the temple you know the great high priest is yahweh and he is the priest to god most high so youve got a hierarchy of priests and i think that is how genesis 15 was interpreted where in the apocalypse of abraham abraham sees mostly clearly melchizedek but he describes him as the angel yahweh and he is dressed as a high priest with his purple and his turban thing and yes its all very very interesting all the other earlier sources melchizedek is the priest of el elyon almost certainly yahweh part of the great angel hierarchy i mean the implications of that for melchizedek priesthood is just mind boggling absolutely mind boggling so there is a lot of work for people to do waiting to be done oh dear it would be nice if we didnt need sleep wed get such a lot more done
2548128 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2548129 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2548130 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2548131 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2548132 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2548133 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2548134 i hope those remaining five will also be released as they had not done anything to harm the peace
2548135 they did it in memory of those who were killed in 1988 and i hope the authorities who have declared plans to establish democracy in the country will treat those youths leniently and release them quickly
2548136 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2548137 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military

2548142 during a stressful campaign you can find out a lot about a candidates personal integrity and cason passed every test with flying colors i witnessed cason being truthful and forthright with voters and never heard of him or his campaign uttering an untrue or negative word
2548143 i believe that gary stanislawski intentionally tried to deceive the voters on multiple occasions the most egregious example was his blatant attempt during the waning hours of the campaign to insinuate that senator jim inhofe was supporting him something that could not be further from the truth the fact is stanislawskis use of a photo of him with senator inhofe prompted senator inhofe to issue a statement to deny he had endorsed him many voters however already had the image in their mind and are just now finding out that this was a hoax perpetuated by stanislawski
2548144 the picture was taken at the state republican convention this year and senator inhofe said at that time we could use the photograph but that he was not endorsing anyone in a primary election we were very clear in the mailing that both billy joe daugherty and senator inhofe do not and were not endorsing the campaign but as individuals they know and respect gary stanislawski
2548145 we have moved beyond the primary and wish applekamp the best but he worked as a lobbyist he campaigns on and brags about that experience working with government ok so public service company of oklahoma is a private company but they sent him to the legislature to become an insider or friend of the system as a paid lobbyist and we need elected officials that are not lobbyists or trial lawyers
2548146 i am very happy to have the support and help of jeff applekamp i have known jeff for quite some time and he is an active part of the fabric of tulsa and the republican party he ran a positive campaign and proven he is a man of character who understands the issues i am grateful to jeff for his support and glad to add such a quality person to our campaign team
2548147 at the end of the day folks dont care which party wins they just want policy issues fixed to help the people of the district issues in district 72 include street repair home ownership and the reduction of crime
2548148 the county election board must mail the ballots to the voter and the voter must return the voted ballots by mail
2548149 they cant even agree on a candidate they are no longer a factor
2548150 america has never faced so many different crises at the same time in living memory
2548151 and the bible says that such a leader will soon make his appearance on the scene it wont be barack obama but obamas world tour provided a foretaste of the reception he can expect to receive
2548152 he will probably also stand in some european capital addressing the people of the world and telling them that he is the one that they have been waiting for and he can expect as wildly enthusiastic a greeting as obama got in berlin
2548153 the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance
2548154 se a opini o p blica pode em geral ficar influenciada pela figura de algu m que exposto publicamente e sem necessidade com o uso de algemas o que n o dizer do j ri de uma pacata cidade do interior de laranjal paulista cuja ju za de certo por inexperi ncia ou quem sabe por um receio exacerbado como titular do poder de pol cia das audi ncias podia muito bem convocar mais um policial civil

2548158 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2548159 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2548160 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2548161 we have increased our worldwide sales in july despite difficult business conditions

2548177 surely it is propaganda still to think the japanese a would fight to the last man at this late stage of the war
2548178 38 no the okinawains themselves were forced to fight or die by the japanese
2548179 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2548180 its going to be a race between three or four of us tomorrow night and im looking forward to it or tomorrow morning i should say
2548181 its going to be a tough one but im sure going to give him a run for his money
2548182 i do get a little bit jittery thinking about it
2548183 it was definitely on my mind a little bit it cant not be
2548184 to come back and swim a smart race im really happy with it
2548185 i dont want to be in lane four given to the fastest swimmer
2548186 i dont swim well when im the center of attention
2548187 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2548188 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on
2548189 obviously having the heats at night shakes things up a little bit i know i have more than that in me
2548190 i didnt want to take any chances with the last heat going all best times leaving me out in the dust im going to have a double shot espresso tomorrow morning and ill be ready
2548191 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick
2548192 that was the first good set in four months i was moving well and not thinking of every shot
2548193 i was flowing and that was a good feeling ill look back to it as a turning point
2548194 it is ending up being the right thing for my tennis
2548195 ill get in two events la and washington which i needed
2548196 as the world will be glued to the beijing extravaganza hosted by china and watching the flags of their respective countries the tibetan community will be missing the flag of their beloved country tibet
2548197 every obstacle to the unconditional return of the dalai lama to tibet should be removed
2548198 as the world will be glued to the beijing extravaganza hosted by china and watching the flags of their respective countries the tibetan community will be missing the flag of their beloved country tibet
2548199 every obstacle to the unconditional return of the dalai lama to tibet should be removed
2548200 as the world will be glued to the beijing extravaganza hosted by china and watching the flags of their respective countries the tibetan community will be missing the flag of their beloved country tibet
2548201 every obstacle to the unconditional return of the dalai lama to tibet should be removed
2548202 so if you have a brunette in your collection maybe shell go for more money
2548203 we shot the episode from 1 a m to 4 a m i had a tough time keeping my eyes open but salman entertained us all through he played a double role he was both the host and the hero of one of the films i was promoting
2548204 when did i ever say i had any problems with salman we make a fantastic on screen pair we proved it in mujhse shaadi karogi and now again in god tussi great ho we rock together amitji amitabh bachchan plays god by the way as for salman hes always fun on the sets
2548205 he had me in splits during the shooting he had bobby and me entertained throughout dus ka dum and yes we both won a lot of money
2548206 it has been a long and hard road but i am deeply pleased that ab 583 is now moving to the senate floor this reform is a critical step to helping restore the voters confidence in government and i trust that the rest of my colleagues in the senate will recognize its necessity
2548207 secretary of state candidates like all other candidates have to spend huge amounts of time raising money for their campaigns from private contributors
2548208 californians would have more faith in their government if candidates could instead spend more time reaching out to voters and discussing issues that matter to them
2548209 protests from the institute for governmental advocates to prevent legislators from supporting ab 583 and clean election financing are absurd
2548210 we are a most modestly funded advocacy organization and we find the proposed fee quite acceptable its unconscionable that well paid california lobbyists with well to do clients do not want to pay what lobbyists pay in other states ab 583 will level the playing field and make it easier for secretary of state candidates who do not have wealthy backers to run
2548211 assemblymember loni hancock senate elections chair ron calderon senate appropriations chair tom torlakson and ab 583 co author senate president pro tem don perata have all taken a bold step towards achieving californians wishes to explore an alternative to the way we finance election campaigns
2548212 with their support and the support of other senators on the senate floor well be one step closer to truly fair elections in california
2548213 all sides must remember that attacks on civilians or acts intended to terrorize civilians clearly violate international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes
2548214 this would be true even if they are carried out in reprisal for indiscriminate attacks by the adversary
2548215 the road which was intended for evacuation of the wounded has been bombed
2548216 once again snwa has demonstrated that they are only interested in their own immediate convenience without regard for environmental regulations or the long term damage they will cause to the waters of rural nevada
2548217 as a result unfortunately we are forced to take legal action
2548218 fishermen everywhere should be alarmed that snwa is planning to blunder into one of nevadas only remaining disease free fisheries for its own greedy purposes in its continuing effort to suck the great basin dry
2548219 their planned activities threaten the future stocking of streams in eastern nevada as introduction of pathogens into spring creek would jeopardize the operations at spring creek rearing station we cannot simply stand aside while snwa destroys yet another of the great basins scarce precious waterways
2548220 the waters and fish of these creeks have been sacred to the goshute indians since time immemorial
2548221 this latest recklessness is yet another assault by snwa on the land and waters that are our lifeblood snwa has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to strike at the heart of our peoples spiritual and cultural connection with the waters of snake valley indicating that they are indifferent to the fact that these waters are a part of us and we are a part of them
2548222 the violence and destruction associated with the marijuana trade are increasingly apparent throughout our system of state and federal lands operation loccust is successfully pushing back against the dangerous drug cartels that have infiltrated our public lands as well as the demand for marijuana that fuels their criminal enterprises
2548223 i am impressed with the way these agencies have worked together in planning and coordinating this operation
2548224 this has set a standard for future large scale collaborations and can be used as model throughout the state
2548225 surely it is propaganda still to think the japanese a would fight to the last man at this late stage of the war
2548226 38 no the okinawains themselves were forced to fight or die by the japanese
2548227 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
2548228 sheds light on one of those nagging questions in herpetology how did a diversity of fang types among snakes evolve
2548229 god saw everything that he had made and indeed it was very good
2548230 currently five to six million workers in california do not have paid sick days and that represents about 40 percent of the work force
2548231 we are not robots we all get sick and so everybody understands this predicament
2548232 as a sportsman i believe sport has a major role to play in promoting environmental issues
2548233 so i will work with young people across the world and try to inspire them to plant trees use energy efficient light bulbs harvest rain water and to become environmental champions in their own communities
2548234 what happens if we invite people into our churches and they never change
2548235 jesus didnt come to make us safe he came to make us brave

2548253 tina just gets on my nerves and i am not supporting a reunion with bette

2548268 if it freezes banks from being able to foreclose if this trend should continue you really do create a chilling effect on the lending industry because whos going to want to lend money if they dont have the capacity to get their asset back if theres a default on the loan

2548284 narrated ali i got a she camel in my share of the war booty on the day of the battle of badr
2548285 then the apostle heard that abu sufyan b harb was coming from syria with a large caravan of quraysh containing their money and merchandise accompanied by some thirty or forty men
2548286 this is the quraysh caravan containing their property go out to attack it perhaps god will give it as prey
2548287 so the apostle was afraid that the ansar would not feel obligated to help him unless he was attacked by an enemy in medina and that they would not feel it incumbent upon them to go with him against an enemy outside their territory
2548288 when abu sufyan got near the hijaz he was seeking news and questioning every rider in his anxiety until he got news from some riders that muhammad had called out his companions against him and his caravan he took alarm at that and hired damdam b amr al ghifari and sent him to mecca ordering him to call out quraysh in defense of their property
2548289 abu sufyan went forward to get in front of the caravan as a precautionary measure until he came down to the water and asked majdi if he had noticed anything he replied that he had seen nothing untoward merely two riders had stopped on the hill and taken water away in a skin abu sufyan came to the spot where they had halted picked up some camel dung and broke it in pieces and found that it contained date stones by god he said this is fodder of yathrib he returned at once to his companions and changed the caravans direction from the road to the seashore leaving badr on the left traveling as quickly as possible
2548290 when abu sufayn saw that he had saved his caravan he sent word to quraysh
2548291 fleeing from battle is prohibited and its punishment allah said while warning against fleeing from the battlefield and threatening those who do it with the fire
2548292 so all went not of their nobles remained behind except abu lahab
2548293 that which is seized by violence or obtained by robbery especially collective spoil taken in war plunder pillage
2548294 but now enjoy what ye took in war lawful and good but fear allah for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
2548295 then the apostle ordered that everything that had been collected in the camp should be brought together and muslims quarreled about it
2548296 they ask thee o muhammad of the spoils of war say the spoils of war belong to allah and the messenger so keep your duty to allah and adjust the matter of your difference and obey allah and his messenger if ye are true believers
2548297 and know that out of all the booty that ye may acquire in war a fifth share is assigned to allah and to the messenger and to near relatives orphans the needy and the wayfarer
2548298 it is clear that gaining booty in the struggle to islam fighting against the enemies of allah and his messenger has always been a major means of livelihood for muslims in situations when the muslim community is truly fulfilling its role of ensuring the deen is allahs alone

2548559 und da bisher niemand eine medaille aus peking besitzt wird der preis zu anfang sicher sehr hoch gehen
2548560 manchmal kommt so ein st ck aus einem nachlass und die leute wissen nicht worum es sich handelt dann landet die medaille auf dem flohmarkt
2548561 in m nchen 1972 gab es medaillen bei denen die kette mit einer se angeschraubt war

2548606 following massive media campaigns and perception management programmes by the zimbabwe tourism authority the british government has lifted their travel ban which it had imposed on their citizens wishing to visit zimbabwe
2548607 the lifting of the travel ban comes as good news to the local tourism industry and hopes that it will increase tourist arrivals from that country
2548608 we advise against all but essential travel to zimbabwe at this time the situation remains unpredictable and incidents of violence across the country continue it could deteriorate further without warning

2548675 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2548676 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2548677 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2548678 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2548687 we cant live today like we did in the 17th or 18th century our culture has to be dynamic
2548688 within the last 40 years weve jumped 300 400 years
2548689 i think most people today know this is just a story
2548690 it was like the bears or the leopards why would we question it
2548691 i tell people lets not dig too much into it
2548692 look this country is changing so much theres a lot of money here now a lot of business some of these beliefs arent going to survive
2548693 the common belief is that traditionalism dissolves in the solvents of modernity
2548694 we want to attach an economic sense to the culture
2548695 our stories grew around things that we could not explain
2548696 is an implicit sign of being too traditional or even backward
2548697 life is difficult here not like in the towns i want them to get government jobs and live easier lives

2548705 dont worry thats a very good score for someone like you
2548706 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2548707 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2548708 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
2548709 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm were not shooting guns
2548710 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
2548711 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach we want to have a whole tool bag full of methods any and all methods that are effective and safe and i view falconry as one method that could have some use
2548712 the approval by the food and drug administration fda of the first u s h5n1 influenza vaccine for use in humans is a sign of progress in our ongoing efforts to protect the american people from a pandemic
2548713 we have the opportunity to be the first generation that prepares for a pandemic and we are working to that meet that challenge
2548714 some people believe that everything will turn out for the best they are therefore destined to be disappointed i on the other hand prepare myself for the worst should it not occur i am delightfully surprised
2548715 we have the opportunity to be the first generation that prepares for a pandemic and we are working to that meet that challenge
2548716 we have the opportunity to be the first generation that prepares for a pandemic
2548717 we have an opportunity to save lives during a pandemic
2548718 the vaccine was generally well tolerated with the most common side effects reported as pain at the injection site headache general ill feeling and muscle pain the study showed that 45 percent of individuals who received the 90 microgram two dose regimen developed antibodies at a level that is expected to reduce the risk of getting influenza although the level of antibodies seen in the remaining individuals did not reach that level current scientific information on other influenza vaccines suggests that less than optimal antibody levels may still have the potential to help reduce disease severity and influenza related hospitalizations and deaths additional information on this h5n1 influenza vaccine is being collected on safety and effectiveness in other age groups and will be available to the fda in the near future
2548719 one multi center randomized double blinded placebo controlled dose ranging study in healthy adults 18 to 64 years of age investigated the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine a total of 103 healthy adults received a 90 microgram dose of the vaccine by injection followed by another 90 microgram dose 28 days later in addition there were approximately another 300 healthy adults who received the vaccine at doses lower than 90 micrograms and a total of 48 who received placebo by injection of the various doses tested the study showed that the 90 microgram dose had the better immune response meaning that at this particular dose the vaccine induced the most antibodies in the blood against the h5n1 influenza virus strain the 90 microgram two dose regimen produced levels of antibodies expected to reduce the risk of getting h5n1 influenza in 45 percent of those who received it although the remaining individuals did not develop this level of antibody current scientific information on other influenza vaccines suggests that less than optimal antibody levels may still have the potential to help reduce disease severity and influenza related hospitalizations and deaths

2548994 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2548995 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2548996 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen

2549028 this study is significant because previous findings have been contradictory and the present investigation includes the largest number of heart attacks in an elderly group to date
2549029 our findings make a persuasive case that adiponectin is in fact associated with an increase in heart disease risk in older persons
2549030 this study shows that this abundant product of fat cells is a marker and perhaps even a mediator of worsened outcomes in persons aged 65 years and older

2549040 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected we urge an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down of all troops
2549041 we are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences it is not about south ossetia it has never been in the first place it is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace freedom and liberty this unprovoked long time ago planned invasion and aggression must stop i think what is at stake here is the post cold war order

2549053 there is a cascade of reform movements and there is no doubt that ecuador bolivia and venezuela are inspired by what is going on in each others countries

2549057 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2549058 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2549059 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native

2549080 this is a war and in spite of everything i dont think this is a war that was entirely predictable i believe this war could have been prevented now all we can do is watch when and how it will end despite the poignancy of the situation the person who shaped our foreign policy including in the south caucasus is attending the olympic games why is he not coming back is this not important enough for him
2549081 this will affect relations between georgias president and his western patrons he got out rather successfully of this winters political crisis surrounding the early parliamentary and presidential elections but this time he took an incomprehensible stance for the west because georgia had consistently positioned itself as a staunch opponent of military conflict even if georgias military offensive was indeed provoked by south ossetians this is nonetheless a serious political mistake
2549082 we once condemned similar actions by the russian leadership in chechnya and we now condemn the georgian leaderships actions in south ossetia we believe that the war can be stopped with this aim we call on both sides of the conflict particularly on georgia to immediately end armed hostilities we suggest that russia propose to deploy peacekeepers to the line separating the fighting parties russia must finally start playing an active role in regulating the conflict this means it must become an mediator and stop always being on one side
2549083 from a military perspective its absolutely obvious that what is now a full blown war was initiated by the georgian leadership just when saakashvili ended his television statements the georgian forces were meant to halt their strategic deployment as far as i know the offensive started two or three hours later in that sense there is no doubt even if a miracle happens and the fighting ends immediately what happened means the conflict will drag on for years if not decades
2549084 south ossetian leader eduard kokoity is a criminal who russian political experts at the time wrote was a member of a st petersburg criminal group and his ministers are retired chekists who came from russia he enjoys neither the support nor the respect of residents in the region that he allegedly symbolically controls it is obvious that ethnic ossetians who live in tskhinvali and ossetian villages have no desire to defend his regime
2549085 its very painful to note the international communitys failure to respond swiftly and appropriately however i would like to remind you once again that the russian federation which represents one of the parties and is now in fact the aggressor is a permanent member of the un security council with veto power this of course makes taking any concrete tangible decisions within the council complicated
2549086 its obvious that russia is doing unacceptable things in its neighborhood i think no other country dares behave that way and the west has so far been unable to tame it besides taming is not a good policy anyway its like constantly feeding a crocodile that in the end devours you other measures should have been taken a clear line should have been drawn but when you have a lot of oil and gas and you are cunning you can achieve a lot

2549090 ten an que saber ya cu l era la situaci n econ mica de espa a
2549091 siempre hay indicadores que avisan de lo que est a punto de ocurrir
2549092 ahora continu es obvio que zapatero minti durante la campa a electoral cuando neg que espa a estaba en crisis y llam antipatriotas a los que advert amos de que las cosas en econom a se iban a poner peor
2549093 por lo tanto durante la campa a electoral zapatero minti doblemente fue un mentiroso cuando dijo que en espa a no hab a crisis econ mica porque ya sab a que la hab a y fue un mentiroso cuando se comprometi a intentar alcanzar el pleno empleo porque seg n su vicepresidente econ mico ya ten a que saber que eso no lo iba a poder cumplir
2549094 y zapatero fue claramente indecente durante la campa a cuando no cont la verdad a los espa oles ni sobre la situaci n econ mica ni sobre las posibilidades que ten a su programa electoral
2549095 nos gustar a que se dejase ayudar y para eso no vamos a parar de proponerle nuevas medidas y nuevas cosas que se pueden hacer
2549096 tan de izquierdas que en s lo un a o ha conseguido que espa a tenga n meros rojos
2549097 no obstante todas las medidas razonables que zapatero proponga el pp las va apoyar y adem s el pp va a proponer sus propias medidas y le gustar a que zapatero aceptase alguna
2549098 ese dinero es m s del doble de lo que en el presente marco de crisis el gobierno zapatero quer a gastarse en la compra de solares para construir viviendas de protecci n oficial por qu no suprimimos esa partida de gasto se pregunt eso es austeridad
2549099 estoy convencido de que zapatero podr a pasar con muchos menos asesores y con mucho menos personal de confianza
2549100 son los que le dijeron que no hab a crisis
2549101 hay muchas partidas que podr a reducir quit ndose a lo mejor un poco de grandeza pero adapt ndose a la situaci n que est n viviendo millones de espa oles
2549102 no debe tocar ninguna partida de gasto social por m s que zapatero pueda tener la tentaci n de tocarlas manifest el gasto social en espa a lo hacen las comunidades aut nomas que son las prestan servicios de sanidad educaci n o asistencia social

2549104 and on my first day in office i will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces you will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace
2549105 as president i will fight a smarter more effective war on terror we will deploy every tool in our arsenal our economic as well as our military might our principles as well as our firepower
2549106 our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself we are here to affirm that when americans stand up and speak their minds and say america can do better that is not a challenge to patriotism it is the heart and soul of patriotism
2549107 that flag doesnt belong to any president it doesnt belong to any ideology and it doesnt belong to any political party it belongs to all the american people
2549108 our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow pay as you go and let me tell you what we wont do we wont raise taxes on the middle class youve heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months so let me say straight out what i will do as president i will cut middle class taxes i will reduce the tax burden on small business and i will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over 200 000 a year so we can invest in job creation health care and education

2549112 ill use linux at so that i can get better at it
2549113 from crowd to players to management and directors at plymouth there was an apprehension with the changeover in personnel we have had to have over the past 18 months
2549114 we are short i still think there are two or three players we need to really put an edge to us but i would rather be in that position at this minute in time and have that bonus that we are going to bring in two or three more players
2549115 managers before me have had the great backbone of the old guard but now we are having to rebuild from scratch and it takes time for that transition to kick in
2549116 i told the players i think we should have won so theres no point patting each other on the back
2549117 there were elements of it that were good the determination coming from behind being down twice having a real scrap as not many teams will win here
2549118 the down side is we didnt finish our chances and i didnt think we defended well certainly for their goals
2549119 hey this guy is a dork i better give the invite before he does something desperate

2549125 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2549126 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2549127 where most of us lament the premature obsolescence of our cell phones there are those few of us whove pinned the memories of our family members on a rocket hoping it will touch the sky
2549128 greatly outweighed by the undeniable debt that nasa owes mr doohan how many engineers there got their dreams kindled by the magical fingers of the miracle worker bringing life from certain death
2549129 i havent seen anything but the preliminary results but it looks like martin kohler will take a top 10 position
2549130 i was very excited for todays race because these sorts of short time trials are a bit of a specialty of mine
2549131 when i saw the course i knew i could do well because i love these short competitions
2549132 today we took a gamble and didnt bring along any time trial equipment
2549133 the logistics became just too complicated since weve only recently returned from europe and a large portion of the resources have been devoted to our altitude training camp in utah this week we just decided it was too much to bring the gear but i think well probably see a 10 15 second loss for our riders especially since it was pretty windy out there
2549134 it would have been nice to have the time trial bike
2549135 but we did have the clip on aerobars so hopefully that will have helped too
2549136 the way the organizers have chosen to score these events focuses on the equally weighted points which are awarded according to finishing positions at the end of each stage
2549137 the points will go 20 deep and they will be using racing times to break ties so we are still racing with time in mind but only as the tie breaker
2549138 saturdays criterium will be a little tough for me since ive never done an american crit before and i know they can be very hard
2549139 but i am very excited for sundays road race because it will be hard with the hills and so it may suit my talents pretty well
2549140 i would very much like to have a chance to do well in the overall
2549141 the crit will be difficult but if i am still in a good position for sunday the team may very well ride for me
2549142 but we also have danilo wyss here who is very strong at the moment so we will just talk to each other on the day and find out who has the legs to go for the win
2549143 in switzerland we have criteriums but you have only 40 guys riding them at a time
2549144 it will be a lot more intense here and if it is rainy then the cornering becomes very tricky we will just have to see how it goes
2549145 i just didnt have any more strength in the legs
2549146 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2549147 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2549148 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2549149 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2549150 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2549151 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2549152 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2549153 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2549154 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2549155 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about

2549162 always a nice situation when you have those guys compared to three new freshmen huh

2549165 our staff has the best people you could ask for
2549166 when prospects see the development of players like cicchini the fact speaks for itself
2549167 this is a year round commitment no question about it
2549168 its a total development of mental physical and technical skills we demand everything from our players at the highest level it is importance to the program

2549170 when its showtime we are going to try to bring a little bit more to the table
2549171 you are always looking to get better without a national championship our coaches will continue to want more
2549172 este acto de solidaridad del pueblo boliviano y de los pueblos ind genas de venezuela es la mejor expresi n la mejor manifestaci n de que somos la misma familia la misma sangre estamos defendiendo lo que nos corresponde

2549175 non suono il rock rock una parola inventata dai bianchi non amo neanche la parola jazz che i bianchi ci hanno appiccicato addosso noi suoniamo semplicemente nero e suoniamo secondo laria dei tempi
2549176 we are ready to hear what the chief minister has to say but unfortunately he is not saying anything
2549177 why cannot a frank and free dialogue happen which is acceptable to both parties it is shameful that no dialogue has been initiated by the state government with the satyagrahis
2549178 every community must have the right to concede or not to concede to any project and this is what the indian constitution has granted
2549179 article 243 of the indian constitution says that the first right to plan development should lie with the smallest of the communities the grams sabhas and the ward sabhas in rural and urban areas respectively
2549180 this beautiful state of sikkim is not just a tourist centre it is a place of cultural centre which the state is flooded with she said
2549181 no one is against development per se but development is a chain that is desirable and acceptable to those people who are to be directly affected she added
2549182 this is the most reasonable democratic demand which the chamling government should accept
2549183 als dat moet via deze bypass dan doen we dat
2549184 trabaja y toma decisiones para mejorar la vida de la gente
2549185 vimos muchas fotos y ninguna propuesta ganaron las fotos por goleada y con
2549186 these are signs of social tensions and problems for future in the quite peaceful land due to no land no money situation topping it with no education and qualification and no job
2549187 nine families whose 70 land has been acquired have no knowledge of the situation and no one knows what might happen to them once their compensation money runs out
2549188 this is the reason why tribals should not be separated from their land for investment means nothing to most of them save for few exceptions we see many busuks in the making
2549189 we are still waiting and will not quit we shall go till the end and will die if required for dzongu if we are not heard the way the government is not paying any heed means that they do not care for us or for the beleifs and sentiments attached to the land thus far no central or state government official has come to us with anything we shall not be deterred by this and will stand for our beleifs until there is life left in us
2549190 even when he was put on oxygen he refused to eat anything he was adamant ready to die but we convinced him to end his hunger strike he is still adamant and wants to return
2549191 we understand tashis sentiments but his life is important to us and dzongu but here i want to say that for us we shall only stop if we receive something in black and white
2549192 even people from outside dzongu are realising the importance of this cause and are joining us i also want to say that we are in the process of bringing the entire state together about mass rallies and protest dharnas these shall be conducted when the time comes
2549193 we still have not received this in writing which we should have if the chief minister has put this in record then we should be given a document in writing till now there has been no confirmation communicated to us in this regard by the government
2549194 i am not opposing the developmental activities of state but it is also very crucial to preserve the environment culture and heritage of the area
2549195 if the environment and cultural heritage of the land of the lepchas are disturbed how will the people continue to stay in that area
2549196 the mines and zoology department has sent a report to the state government that a huge landslide may occur in future due to these hydel projects if this happens not only the lepcha community but other communities would also face problems
2549197 it is unfortunate to say that the indian government has completely turned a blind eye towards the tibetan problem
2549198 we are basically going on a pilgrimage to our holy land hopefully the march will also raise awareness about the significance of the place to us every lepcha will be hurt if people violate the sanctity of the place
2549199 we will be spending the night at singtam and resume our march tomorrow morning
2549200 we dont want our brother die like this the government has become mute spectators
2549201 we have requested tashi namgyal to call off his hunger strike we dont want him to continue because of his critical condition
2549202 ringpi and rukel are located inside khangchendzonga national park the government took a conscious decision not to allot these projects to any developer to conserve the environment and ecology of the area
2549203 the project on completion would supply 12 free power to the state government for the first 15 years and 15 free thereafter full ownership would be transferred to the government after 35 years which would significantly contribute towards gdp revenues and overall development of the state
2549204 there will be 60m high concerted faced rock fill dam two numbers 11 0 m finished diameter tunnels one intake tunnel two desiliting chambers headrace tunnel two pressure shafts underground power house complex tailrace tunnel and pothead yard
2549205 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2549206 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2549207 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2549208 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2549209 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2549210 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2549211 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2549212 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2549213 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2549214 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2549215 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2549216 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2549217 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2549218 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2549219 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2549220 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2549221 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2549222 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2549223 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2549224 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2549225 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2549226 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2549227 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2549228 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2549229 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2549230 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2549231 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2549232 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2549233 who are open to doing something on the production side
2549234 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2549235 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2549236 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

2549244 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2549245 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2549246 the state governments failure to come up with an appropriate solution compelled us to once again redressal our demand by going for the indefinite strike
2549247 we want the government to give us proper solution as the matter is very much crucial and sensitive
2549248 we have a plan to organize more such rallies in the days to come to make our issue and demand alive
2549249 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2549250 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2549251 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2549252 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2549253 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2549254 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2549255 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2549256 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2549257 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2549258 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2549262 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2549263 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2549264 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2549265 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2549266 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2549267 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2549268 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2549269 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2549270 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2549271 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2549272 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2549299 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2549300 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2549301 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2549302 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2549303 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2549304 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2549305 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2549306 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2549307 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2549308 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2549309 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2549310 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2549311 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2549312 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2549313 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2549314 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2549315 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2549316 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2549317 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2549318 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2549319 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2549320 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2549321 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2549322 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2549323 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2549324 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2549325 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2549326 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2549383 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2549384 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
2549385 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
2549386 these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse
2549387 hell go pro i live in the same area as gavin and i know him very well
2549388 i knew he was struggling at that weight 60kg but i didnt know it was this bad
2549389 in the final tournament before the olympics a boxer should be fighting at his own weight not the one above
2549390 maybe he thought there was still six to eight weeks to get down in weight but he couldnt do it
2549391 he won the world championships in chicago in october and who was ringside oscar de la hoya now a promoter put two and two together
2549392 hell either sign up with promoters frank warren or mick hennessy or even de la hoya
2549393 but its more difficult to assess how a fighter will adapt to professional boxing
2549394 amateur boxing is a tic tac game theres not as much power its about speed speed of movement its not as good a preparation for the professional game as it was in my day
2549395 hes got all the skills and that but will he be powerful enough tactically hes very good hes a beautiful boxer
2549396 look at athens silver medallist amir khan and the problems hes having hes hitting guys but hes not taking them out theyre walking straight through
2549397 lets face it he was most peoples hopes and favourite for the gold medal
2549398 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2549399 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2549400 two members of the commission brought up the fact that they still were not convinced that the president had been shot from the sixth floor window of the texas book depository
2549401 these members failed to understand the trajectory of the slugs that killed the president he stated he felt this point would be discussed further but of course would represent no problem
2549402 though we did experience some difficulty with all the members of the warren commission ford was of considerable help to the bureau
2549403 by asking the iraqis to take responsibility for their future and to invest in their own country
2549404 let me be clear we are well over five years into a war in a country that had nothing to do with the 9 11 attacks
2549405 our country has spent nearly a trillion dollars in iraq even as our schools are underfunded our roads and bridges are crumbling and the cost of everything from groceries to a gallon of gas is soaring
2549406 now think for a moment about what we could have done with the hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that weve spent in iraq
2549407 we could have made historic investments in alternative energy to create millions of american jobs we could have headed off 4 dollar a gallon gas and begun to end the tyranny of oil in our time
2549408 tax cut after tax cut for the wealthiest americans who dont need them and didnt even ask for them

2549410 in 2006 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth and asked for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness we have kept this within our family since that time
2549411 i grew up as a small town boy in north carolina came from nothing worked very hard dreamed that i could do something helpful for other people with my life became a lawyer through a lot of work and success i got some acclaim as a lawyer
2549412 then i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences and nothing could be further from the truth
2549413 i was at the beverly hilton i was trying to keep this mistake i made from becoming public
2549414 ive never paid a dime of money never asked anybody to pay a dime of money nothing has been done at my request
2549415 im not sure i had a political career in the future not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2549416 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2549417 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2549418 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote

2549462 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first a lot of this was in his act bernie would talk about things that i think were not viewed by hollywood as being mainstream y type subjects his act was very edgy and very raw bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other people bernie was a big hit with a certain segment of even the black community the more working class and urban audiences he was their hero
2549463 what bernie brought for comics all over was his style theres only one bernie mac style straight forth its the realism
2549464 bernie gave you the sense that if you put the work in itll pay off for you eventually
2549465 his show with the family was a positive showing that black people could have things and be successful in life

2549470 sen obama needs at least 300 foreign policy advisers probably a lot more
2549471 hes spent very little time learning about traveling reflecting on and being involved in national security issues in recent years
2549472 theres not a significant national security issue of the past 20 or more years that he has not been centrally involved in
2549473 we dont have a mini state department or a mini defense department here in one sense sen mccain needs foreign policy advisers like tiger woods needs a golf coach
2549474 sen obamas own life experiences have given him a unique perspective on the complexities of the world
2549475 is extremely aware of emerging issues and threats comfortable processing complex information and rendering correct judgments on key issues such as iraq nonproliferation and afghanistan
2549476 they feel that iraq and afghanistan have sucked all of the oxygen out of the foreign policy and the national security policy agenda in the bush administration

2549486 volatility remained high in both the us equity and fixed income markets last week
2549487 however a less hawkish statement on policy from the fomc on august 5 combined with sharply declining energy prices provided a powerful lift for last week despite generally weak economic reports

2549606 the condition of three people was critical while many suffered serious injuries
2549607 the crime of rape is no less than murder and there is no ground to grant bail to the criminal

2549609 we all will have to work together to change the mindset of society as society treats the victim as bearer of stigma which is permanently attached to her throughout life whereas the criminal carries no stigma

2549691 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2549692 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2549693 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2549694 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2549695 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2549696 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2549703 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2549714 ich kann das nicht erkl ren damit habe ich eines meiner drei ziele verpasst umso mehr brenne ich nach diesem tag auf die beiden finals im team und im mehrkampf
2549715 die mannschaft hat sich insgesamt gut dargestellt im finale ohne streichwert gibt es neue chancen aber auch neue risiken

2549717 no johnny the universe was not created in six days
2549718 im very happy to be informed its the first gold for china it added different meaning to the medal
2549719 what i thought was to make every good attempt and achieve as much as i can
2549720 i had low expectations of myself but my coach and teammates created ideal conditions for me to win
2549721 it is a great feeling to score my second goal of the tournament
2549722 although we made some small mistakes we did a great job in general we are competing at the right time and right place with support from the people of our country
2549723 i didnt think that id be first to get it not until the finals
2549724 i knew it would be quick but not quite that quick
2549725 its always great to get the first race over and done with
2549726 but a few things went wrong there and still going in fastest qualifier for the semifinal its great to know that i have something to improve on
2549727 i do get a little bit jittery thinking about it
2549728 it was definitely on my mind a little bit it cant not be
2549729 to come back and swim a smart race im really happy with it
2549730 i dont want to be in lane four given to the fastest swimmer
2549731 i dont swim well when im the centre of attention

2549733 boards on the bench that i use as secondary communications devices when developing projects that require serial communications having a second controller to send rs232 messages to the primary target board is quite convenient
2549734 theyve pretty much told me that they are grooming me down here to pitch in the back end of the game up there
2549735 theyve made it clear to me that im down here for a reason and thats to get ready to get guys out in the last inning or two thats what im doing

2549781 it is ending up being the right thing for my tennis
2549782 ill get in two events la and washington which i needed
2549783 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2549784 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2549785 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2549786 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2549787 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2549788 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2549789 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2549790 the escalation in fighting is dangerously destabilising and there is also the threat of civilian losses on a large scale
2549791 reports of fighting and bombing outside south ossetia are especially disturbing as they represent a broadening and deepening of the conflict
2549792 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2549793 the uk will be discussing with all our partners how to stop the spread of violence secure a ceasefire and get talks under way
2549794 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2549795 but i do support saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2549796 the shame disgust and lasting unease will persist in some of those young women for the rest of their lives
2549797 through the hard work and dedication of the investigating officers and with the co operation and courage of victims and witnesses what began as a straight forward burglary inquiry rapidly expanded into a major investigation into numerous sexual offences against multiple victims across several years
2549798 though the investigation was complex and convoluted at times one thing to come out of it is crystal clear anthony batchelor was and remains a sexual predator and a danger to the public
2549799 he will be eligible for release after just three years and nine months but will only be freed if an expert parole panel deems he is no longer a threat
2549800 i said hold on babe i gotta call you back
2549801 the crowd parted he tipped his hat i shot it real quick its one of the few instances when i knew i had taken a really great photo
2549802 you dont know how fast and how widespread that can happen until it does the reach of it is insane
2549803 they want the diversity of photography that were seeing on the web
2549804 theyre tired of old cheesy looking stock images they want black latino or asian subjects
2549805 you dont need to be a full time pro to monetize your photography
2549806 my images are stolen all the time all over the world thats perfectly fine and good for me
2549807 people steal it and they make it more and more popular that makes it more likely legitimate people will license it
2549808 should a car dealer in austin have to pay as much as toyota in japan
2549809 i get a lot more exposure when i share them than if i put them behind an all rights reserved wall
2549810 every photo i have on flickr is with a camera i carry in my pocket
2549811 she said i had some talent and suggested i take it more seriously
2549812 that led to me upgrading to professional grade equipment and seeking out more actively some paying roles
2549813 the last thing you want to see is a photo thats important to you used in a satire or in a youtube video you object to morally
2549814 people have to balance the accessibility of their images versus the way people might misuse those images online
2549815 either you live your life in an open way or you have to keep it totally private
2549816 i understand how frustrating and difficult it is for john to comprehend that he is ever wrong about anything
2549817 i understand why the republicans think they have that issue but the vast majority of the american people blame george bush and the oil companies for high gas prices
2549818 so i think that is an issue that ultimately will not help them
2549819 voters blame congress for doing nothing to solve the energy crisis
2549820 john yarmuth has voted five times against drilling and he will be held accountable on election day
2549821 watch for john and his friend nancy pelosi to flip on drilling
2549822 you cant have a secret ballot and have the ability to count it accurately

2549845 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
2549846 this song is not only outrageously offensive to senator clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
2549847 well this involves two people i highly respect and from a position of just believing in freedom of speech i feel ludacris expressed himself in a manner he felt necessary i also know all eyes are on barack obama because of the position hes in so before someone like fox news attaches him to it obama had to do he what he had to i understand i think luda would understand and it doesnt change my opinion on who im going to vote for
2549848 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent
2549849 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
2549850 were going to drill here and were going to drill now
2549851 my opponent doesnt want to drill he wants to inflate your tires
2549852 most presidential candidates fly at about 15 000 ft barack obama has been living at 30 000 ft
2549853 the idea was lets not try to pull him down from that plane and be mad about it lets push him up to 50 000 ft and create an updraft that sends icarus a little closer to the sun
2549854 obamas foreign trip was the last proof that we needed so it is what it is

2549877 the world powers dont see the situation in the north caucasus
2549878 if you can make it here you can make it anywhere
2549879 as gas prices have risen policymakers in washington have exhibited a jimmy carter era mentality
2549880 they are upset that americans use energy and want government to take over the energy marketplace but it is government that has left us vulnerable to reduced supplies and higher prices
2549881 legislators denounce speculators as if people never before attempted to predict future price changes politicians criticize oil companies as if the firms were able to set prices at will if so why were prices so low for so long most of the so called solutions being proposed in congress amount to more regulations and more subsidies and would make our energy problems worse
2549882 one of the worst ideas comes from republican sen john warner who wants the federal government to again set a national speed limit the greatest nonrenewable resource is time which is why americans routinely broke the washington imposed 55 mph speed limit between 1974 and 1995 sen warner may believe his time is worth nothing but the constitution does not empower him and his colleagues to decide how fast people can drive on every road in america one reason we have state and local governments is to enact traffic laws that is not the federal governments responsibility
2549883 americas outer continental shelf is thought to hold some 86 billion barrels of oil the arctic national wildlife refuge has some eight billion barrels oil shale deposits in americas west could contain the equivalent of as much as 1 trillion or more barrels of petroleum its time we allowed americans to develop americas energy resources
2549884 congress also needs to reduce the regulatory barriers to new refinery construction and change environmental rules which mandate the sale of different formulations of gasoline in different regions
2549885 these government controls drive up gasoline prices we couldnt afford the cost during good times we certainly cant afford to pay more for unnecessary regulation now
2549886 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
2549887 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
2549888 we want to see it everywhere but more importantly we want this sign to take the world by storm
2549889 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2549890 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2549891 as pessoas me aconselharam a me aposentar por m essa decis o caberia somente fia bernie ecclestone me disse que seria p ssimo se eu n o conseguisse os votos para continuar no comando por m isto uma democracia se votassem para eu sair eu sairia
2549892 sempre melhor ganhar que perder mas o ponto crucial foi vencer as elei es da fia ganhar o caso foi bom para acabar com todos os coment rios maldosos sobre nazismo o que cada um faz em sua vida sexual n o est em discuss o pessoas adultas n o se importam com isso sempre houve homossexuais na f 1 e agora ningu m liga mais para isso
2549893 n s n o estivemos apenas lentos mas tamb m inconsistentes

2549898 acredito que a marta vai se movimentar mais durante o andamento da competi o

2549900 sab amos tamb m que o advers rio era t cnico r pido e tocava bem a bola foi o que aconteceu s tivemos um erro no final que proporcionou o gol da cor ia mas o principal a conquista dos tr s pontos que v o somar bem na nossa classifica o
2549901 tentamos jogar impondo nosso ritmo claro que cadenciamos o jogo em alguns momentos at para dar uma respirada mas entramos dentro de campo para colocar nosso futebol em pr tica da forma que a gente faz todos os jogos
2549902 i didnt think it would be that fast in the prelims
2549903 its going to shape up for a pretty good race tomorrow
2549904 i dont want to be the center of attention just yet
2549905 i dont want to be breaking world records on the first night its like were playing a card game right now and those guys are showing their hand im just showing them the back and thats where i want to be
2549906 but im sure tomorrow morning ill be a little on edge
2549907 we live like pioneers in the old days when we are up on the mountain
2549908 hes from chicago and he showed he can make it if you push yourself
2549909 whats interesting about bernies career is that he wasnt a mainstream comic at first a lot of this was in his act bernie would talk about things that i think were not viewed by hollywood as being mainstream y type subjects his act was very edgy and very raw bernie would talk about things that other black comics wouldnt talk about like skin color and how being a very dark skinned black man like him made his life very different from other people bernie was a big hit with a certain segment of even the black community the more working class and urban audiences he was their hero
2549910 what bernie brought for comics all over was his style theres only one bernie mac style straight forth its the realism
2549911 bernie gave you the sense that if you put the work in itll pay off for you eventually
2549912 his show with the family was a positive showing that black people could have things and be successful in life
2549913 yeah we know things might not be perfect but what differences can our vote make
2549914 a lot of people dont know about the christian action league until a need comes up and even then they may not understand what the organization does
2549915 one of my goals will be to try to get people more actively involved
2549916 marks heart for preserving christianity and uplifting the scriptures is impeccable you know where his heart is where his passion is
2549917 there are a lot of people who see what is going on in the world but dont know what to do to make it better mark does
2549918 the ministries that continue not to cooperate appear to be heeding the advice of attorneys who are not familiar with congressional oversight in general and specifically the finance committees oversight and legislative work in the area of tax exempt organizations over the last seven years
2549919 these attorneys who arent part of the ministries themselves have a natural incentive to prolong the process as long as possible
2549920 instituting reforms without waiting for the committee to complete its review
2549921 religious conservatives like ourselves believe this to be an unfortunate development but if donors do not insist on even greater levels of ministry cooperation with donor advocate organizations unneeded government regulation is sure to follow
2549922 it has been donors willingness to ignore the clear warning signs from a relatively few questionable ministries that will partly cause any increased government oversight
2549923 the ministry communitys unwillingness to call out those who are simultaneously abusing donors the word of god and current government regulations through meaningful self policing also is to blame for any burdensome new regulations
2549924 that was the first good set in four months i was moving well and not thinking of every shot
2549925 i was flowing and that was a good feeling ill look back to it as a turning point
2549926 it is ending up being the right thing for my tennis
2549927 ill get in two events la and washington which i needed
2549928 i think it going to be a fight with the river
2549929 i dont want to think about any results i just want to fight with the river
2549930 everybodys looking to beat us but every time theyre looking for us we must just go do our runs and the results will come
2549931 this sport is a lottery especially on a course this difficult this water is harder than in athens

2549933 it is a fact however that the great sinister movement is within our society
2549934 so there may be attempt like that and lord jesus christ was killed so they may kill me also
2549935 this movement is not going to stop it will go on
2549936 im pretty hopeful ill be okay there especially with the schedule which is definitely not as hard on the body as it is here
2549937 i think theres a very good chance ill be there i very much want to be there
2549938 after the us open ill take some time off and spend some time with my family and kind of see how it goes
2549939 the last few years ive based my decisions on how i feel and that will be the same in september and october when i take some time off
